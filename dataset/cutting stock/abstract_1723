The characteristics of cation radical (hole) migration in heterogeneous DNA
were investigated on the basis of Kubo formula, in which correlation functions
were obtained from solutions of systems of Bogoliubov hierarchy. The cutting of
Bogoliubov hierarchy was carried out by excepting correlations of the third and
higher order. The obtained system of non-linear differential equations was
investigated both analytically and numerically. The environment polarization,
caused by interaction of holes with base pairs vibrations, was shown to play
the key role in transport processes. The energy of the interaction can ten-fold
exceed vibration energy. The transfer rate between adjacent DNA bases in
one-dimensional case was shown to be almost independent of the nature and
behavior of more distant pairs. The charge probability amplitude oscillates in
the picosecond timescale. Nonetheless, the rates of hole transfer, obtained by
averaging over these oscillations, turned out to be very close to the
experimental data. The calculated dependence of the hole transfer rate between
two guanine bases on the number of intervening adenine bases was also in good
agreement with the experimental data. Besides, the temperature dependence of
the transfer rate was investigated. Hopping mechanism was shown to make the
main contribution to the hole transport process at 300 K.
