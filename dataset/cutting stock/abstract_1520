We have implemented a variant of the force gradient integrator proposed by
Kennedy et.al. and are using it in our production 2+1 flavor DWF simulations
with pion masses of 180 MeV in (4.5fm)3 volumes. We find modest speed-ups (\sim
20%) from using the force gradient integrator, compared to our previously used
Omelyan integrator. On other ensembles, primarily finite temperature 2+1 flavor
DWF QCD, we have extensively tuned the Hasenbusch preconditioning masses and
achieved speed-ups of 2-3x. Here we have also switched to the force gradient
integrator, but this change has not had any impact on the speed. We also report
on an improved solver for DWF, which uses M\"obius fermions, with a smaller
fifth dimension than the original DWF fermions, as an intermediate step in the
generation of solutions of the Dirac equation. This approach cuts the number of
effective Dirac applications by approximately a factor of 2 when the conjugate
gradient iteration count is large.
