We utilize long-term memory, fractal dimension and approximate entropy as
input variables for the Efficiency Index [Kristoufek & Vosvrda (2013), Physica
A 392]. This way, we are able to comment on stock market efficiency after
controlling for different types of inefficiencies. Applying the methodology on
38 stock market indices across the world, we find that the most efficient
markets are situated in the Eurozone (the Netherlands, France and Germany) and
the least efficient ones in the Latin America (Venezuela and Chile).
