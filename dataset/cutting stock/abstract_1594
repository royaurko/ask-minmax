Using a new physical model for star formation (Padoan 1995) we have tested
the possibility that globular clusters (GCs) are formed from primordial mass
fluctuations, whose mass scale ($10^8$ - $10^9$ M$_{\odot}$) is selected out of
a CDM spectrum by the mechanism of non-equilibrium formation of $H_2$. We show
that such clouds are able to convert about 0.003 of their total mass into a
bound system (GC) and about 0.02 into halo stars. The metal enriched gas is
dispersed away from the GC by supernova explosions and forms the galactic disk.
These mass ratios between GCs, halo and disk depend on the predicted IMF which
is a consequence of the universal statistics of fluid turbulence. They also
depend on the ratio of baryonic over non-baryonic mass ,$X_b$, and are
comparable with the values observed in typical spiral galaxies for $X_b \approx
0.1-0.2$. The computed mass and radius for a GC ( $5\times 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$
and 30 pc) are in good agreement with the average values in the Galaxy. The
model predicts an exponential cut off in the stellar IMF below 0.1 M$_{\odot}$
in GCs and 0.6 M$_{\odot}$ in the halo. The quite massive star formation in
primordial clouds leads to a large number of supernovae and to a high blue
luminosity during the first two Gyr of the life of every galaxy.
