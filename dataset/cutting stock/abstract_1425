We examine the possibility of observing exotic top quark decays via
$R$-Parity violating SUSY interactions in $e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s = 500
GeV$. We present cross-sections for $t\bar t$ production followed by the
subsequent decay of either the $t$ or $\overline{t}$ via the $R$-Parity
violating interaction while the other undergoes the SM decay. We discuss
kinematic cuts that allow the exotic SUSY decays to be detected over standard
model backgrounds. Discovery limits for $R$-Parity violating couplings in the
top sector are presented assuming an integrated luminosity of $100 fb^{-1}$.
