We report results from {\it XMM-Newton} observations of thirteen X-ray bright
BL Lacertae objects, selected from the {\it Einstein} Slew Survey sample. The
spectra are generally well fit by power-law models, with four objects having
hard ($\alpha<1; F_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$) spectra that indicates
synchrotron peaks at $>5$ keV. None of our spectra show line features,
indicating that soft X-ray absorption ``notches'' must be rare amongst BL Lacs,
rather than common or ubiquitous as had previously been asserted. We find
significant curvature in most of the spectra. This curvature is almost
certainly intrinsic, as it appears nearly constant from 0.5 to 6 keV, an
observation which is inconsistent with the small columns seen in these sources.
