We reanalyze high resolution data from the New York Stock Exchange and find a
monotonic (but not power law) variation of the mean value per trade, the mean
number of trades per minute and the mean trading activity with company
capitalization. We show that the second moment of the traded value distribution
is finite. Consequently, the Hurst exponents for the corresponding time series
can be calculated. These are, however, non-universal: The persistence grows
with larger capitalization and this results in a logarithmically increasing
Hurst exponent. A similar trend is displayed by intertrade time intervals.
Finally, we demonstrate that the distribution of the intertrade times is better
described by a multiscaling ansatz than by simple gap scaling.
