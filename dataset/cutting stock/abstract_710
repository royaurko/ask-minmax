I describe a few of the most exciting open questions in high energy spin
physics. After a brief look at (g-2)_\mu and the muon electric dipole moment, I
concentrate on QCD spin physics. Pressing questions include the interpretation
of new asymmetries seen in semi-inclusive DIS, measuring the polarized gluon
and quark transversity distributions in the nucleon, testing the DHGHY Sum
Rule, measuring the orbital angular momentum in the nucleon, and many others
which go beyond the space and time allotted for this talk.
