Many applications generate and consume temporal data and retrieval of time
series is a key processing step in many application domains. Dynamic time
warping (DTW) distance between time series of size N and M is computed relying
on a dynamic programming approach which creates and fills an NxM grid to search
for an optimal warp path. Since this can be costly, various heuristics have
been proposed to cut away the potentially unproductive portions of the DTW
grid. In this paper, we argue that time series often carry structural features
that can be used for identifying locally relevant constraints to eliminate
redundant work. Relying on this observation, we propose salient feature based
sDTW algorithms which first identify robust salient features in the given time
series and then find a consistent alignment of these to establish the
boundaries for the warp path search. More specifically, we propose alternative
fixed core&adaptive width, adaptive core&fixed width, and adaptive
core&adaptive width strategies which enforce different constraints reflecting
the high level structural characteristics of the series in the data set.
Experiment results show that the proposed sDTW algorithms help achieve much
higher accuracy in DTWcomputation and time series retrieval than fixed core &
fixed width algorithms that do not leverage local features of the given time
series.
