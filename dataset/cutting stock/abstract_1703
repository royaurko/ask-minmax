We examine the projected correlation of galaxies with mass from small scales
(<few hundred kpc) where individual dark matter halos dominate, out to 15 Mpc
where correlated large-scale structure dominates. We investigate these profiles
as a function of galaxy luminosity and redshift. Selecting 0.8 million galaxies
in the Deep Lens Survey, we use photometric redshifts and stacked weak
gravitational lensing shear tomography out to radial scales of 1 degree from
the centers of foreground galaxies. We detect correlated mass density from
multiple halos and large-scale structure at radii larger than the virial
radius, and find the first observational evidence for growth in the galaxy-mass
correlation on 10 Mpc scales with decreasing redshift and fixed range of
luminosity. For a fixed range of redshift, we find a scaling of projected halo
mass with rest-frame luminosity similar to previous studies at lower redshift.
We control systematic errors in shape measurement and photometric redshift,
enforce volume completeness through absolute magnitude cuts, and explore
residual sample selection effects via simulations.
