BL Lac objects are an elusive and rare class of active galactic nuclei. For
years their evolutionary behavior has appeared inconsistent with the trend
observed in the population of AGN at large. The so-called ``negative''
evolution implies that BL Lacs were either less or fainter in the past. This
effect is stronger for BL Lacs selected in X-ray surveys. We have investigated
if one of the selection criteria, namely the flat-radio spectrum (imposed on
the Radio-selected but not on the X-ray-selected samples), might explain the
different evolutionary trend.
