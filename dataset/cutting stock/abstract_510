We have studied statistical characteristics of five share price time series.
For each stock price, we estimated a best fit quantitative model for the
monthly closing price as based on the decomposition into two defining consumer
price indices selected from a large set of CPIs. It was found that there are
two pairs of similar models (Bank of America/Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs/JPMorgan Chase) with a standalone model for Franklin Resources. From each
pair, one can choose the company with the highest return depending on the
future evolution of defining CPIs
