Let $X \subset \Bbb P^r$ be a smooth algebraic curve in projective space,
over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. For each $m \in \Bbb
N$, the $m$-flexes of $X$ are defined as the points where the osculating
hypersurface of degree $m$ has higher contact than expected, and a hypersurface
$H \subset \Bbb P^r$ is called a $m$-Hessian if it cuts $X$ along its
$m$-flexes. When $X$ is a complete intersection, we give an expression for a
(rational) $m$-Hessian as the Div (in the sense of
Grothendieck-Knudsen-Mumford) of a complex of graded free modules naturally
associated to $X$. The construction of this complex involves relating sheaves
of differential operators on a scheme and a subscheme, and higher Euler
sequences on projective space.
