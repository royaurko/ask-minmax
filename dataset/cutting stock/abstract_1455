We review a physical content of the two simplest models of reggeon field
theory: namely the eikonal and the Schwimmer models. The AGK cutting rules are
used to obtain the inclusive, the inelastic and the diffractive cross sections.
The system of nonlinear equations for these cross sections is written down and
analytic expressions for its solution are obtained. We derive the rapidity gap
dependence of the differential cross sections for diffractive dissociation in
the Schwimmer model and in its eikonalized extension. The results are
interpreted from the partonic viewpoint of the interaction at high energies.
