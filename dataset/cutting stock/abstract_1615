Working within the framework of the minimal supergravity model with gauge
coupling unification and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking (SUGRA), we
map out regions of parameter space explorable by experiments at LEP2, for
center of mass energy options of $\sqrt{s}=150,\ 175$, $190$ and 205 GeV. We
compute signals from all accessible $2 \rightarrow 2$ SUSY pair production
processes using the ISAJET simulation program, and devise cuts that enhance the
signal relative to Standard Model backgrounds, and which also serve to
differentiate various supersymmetric processes from one another. We delineate
regions of SUGRA parameter space where production of neutralino pairs, chargino
pairs, slepton pairs and the production of the light Higgs scalar of SUSY is
detectable above Standard Model backgrounds and distinguishable from other SUSY
processes. In addition, we find small regions of SUGRA parameter space where
$\te\te$, $\tz_2\tz_2$ and $\tnu_L\tnu_L$ production yields spectacular events
with up to four isolated leptons. The combined regions of parameter space
explorable by LEP2 are compared with the reach of Tevatron Main Injector era
experiments. Finally, we comment on how the reach via the neutralino pair
channel is altered when the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking constraint
is relaxed.
