We investigate the probability distributions of the recurrence intervals
$\tau$ between consecutive 1-min returns above a positive threshold $q>0$ or
below a negative threshold $q<0$ of two indices and 20 individual stocks in
China's stock market. The distributions of recurrence intervals for positive
and negative thresholds are symmetric, and display power-law tails tested by
three goodness-of-fit measures including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic,
the weighted KS statistic and the Cram\'er-von Mises criterion. Both long-term
and shot-term memory effects are observed in the recurrence intervals for
positive and negative thresholds $q$. We further apply the recurrence interval
analysis to the risk estimation for the Chinese stock markets based on the
probability $W_q(\Delta{t},t)$, Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis and VaR analysis
conditioned on preceding recurrence intervals.
