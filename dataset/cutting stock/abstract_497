In this paper we consider a new mathematical extension of the Black-Scholes
model in which the stochastic time and stock share price evolution is described
by two independent random processes. The parent process is Brownian, and the
directing process is inverse to the totally skewed, strictly \alpha-stable
process. The subordinated process represents the Brownian motion indexed by an
independent, continuous and increasing process. This allows us to introduce the
long-term memory effects in the classical Black-Scholes model.
