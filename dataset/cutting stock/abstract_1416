We present a lattice QCD calculation of the form factors and differential
decay rates for semileptonic decays of the heavy-light mesons $B$ and $D$ to
the final state $\pi l\nu$. The results are obtained with three methodological
improvements over previous lattice calculations: a matching procedure that
reduces heavy-quark lattice artifacts, the first study of lattice-spacing
dependence, and the introduction of kinematic cuts to reduce model dependence.
We show that the main systematics are controllable (within the quenched
approximation) and outline how the calculations could be improved to aid
current experiments in the determination of~$|V_{ub}|$ and~$|V_{cd}|$.
