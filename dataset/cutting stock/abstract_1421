We study the effects of extra dimension on the muon anomalous magnetic moment
in the stabilized Randall-Sundrum scenario. The effects of the Kaluza-Klein
states heavier than the cut-off scale expected to be of order $\Lambda_\pi$ are
neglected. Contribution from the spin-2 Kaluza-Klein states dominates over that
from the spin-0 radion. The recent BNL E821 results impose a strict constraint
on the parameter space of the model: $\Lambda_\pi \approx 0.4 - 2.1$ TeV with
$k/ M_{\rm Pl} =0.01 - 0.1$. Small $k/M_{\rm Pl}$ is preferred if $\Lambda_\pi$
is TeV scale.
