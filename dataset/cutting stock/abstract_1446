In this paper we calculate the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ contribution due to a light
stabilized radion using the radion couplings both to the kinetic energy and the
mass term of the muon. We find that the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ contribution due to
radion diverges logarithmically with the cut off. We then show that the bound
from precision EW data on radion phenomenology allows a sizable shift in the
radion mediated muon anomaly that could be detected or tested with the present
precision and certainly with the future precision for measuring muon anomaly.
