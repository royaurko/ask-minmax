We study the probability distribution of stock returns at mesoscopic time
lags (return horizons) ranging from about an hour to about a month. While at
shorter microscopic time lags the distribution has power-law tails, for
mesoscopic times the bulk of the distribution (more than 99% of the
probability) follows an exponential law. The slope of the exponential function
is determined by the variance of returns, which increases proportionally to the
time lag. At longer times, the exponential law continuously evolves into
Gaussian distribution. The exponential-to-Gaussian crossover is well described
by the analytical solution of the Heston model with stochastic volatility.
