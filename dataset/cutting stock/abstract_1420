Theory with $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge invariant electroweak Lagrangian
describing standard interaction of massless quark doublet without elementary
scalar Higgs sector is considered. We show in the main order of $1/N_c$
expansion, that there exists a solution, which breaks initial symmetry and is
accompanied by an appearance of zero mass composite scalar doublet. The
electroweak loop corrections shift its mass to a tachyon value and thus the
scalar serves as a substitute for usual elementary Higgs. The $t$-quark mass
also arise. The problem of adjusting its observable mass leads to prediction of
triple gauge constant $\lambda_V \simeq -0.034$ without contradiction with
experimental data. The mass of the surviving composite Higgs scalar is
predicted to be $M_H = 117 \pm 7 GeV$, that agrees with recent indications of
$M_H \simeq 115 GeV$. The resulting theory contains realistic $W, Z, t$ masses,
composite massive Higgs and massless other particles. Parameters used are
cut-off $\Lambda \simeq 3500 GeV$, weak gauge constant $g$ and mixing angle
$\theta_W$.
