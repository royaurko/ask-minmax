We study the evolution of probability distribution functions of returns, from
the tick data of the Korean treasury bond (KTB) futures and the S$&$P 500 stock
index, which can be described by means of the Fokker-Planck equation. We show
that the Fokker-Planck equation and the Langevin equation from the estimated
Kramers-Moyal coefficients are estimated directly from the empirical data. By
analyzing the statistics of the returns, we present quantitatively the
deterministic and random influences on financial time series for both markets,
for which we can give a simple physical interpretation. We particularly focus
on the diffusion coefficient that may be significantly important for the
creation of a portfolio.
