We explore the constraints on the parameter space of a Randall-Sundrum warped
geometry scenario, where a radion field arises out of the attempt to stabilise
the radius of the extra compact spacelike dimension, using the most recent data
from higgs searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Tevatron. We
calculate contributions from both the scalar mass eigenstates arising from
radion-higgs kinetic mixing in all important search channels. The most
important channel to be affected is the decay via WW*, where no invariant mass
peak can discern the two distinct physical states. Improving upon the previous
studies, we perform a full analysis in the WW* channel, taking into account the
effect of various cuts and interference when the two scalar are closely spaced.
We examine both cases where the experimentally discovered scalar is either
'higgs-like' or 'radion-like'. The implications of a relatively massive scalar
decaying into a pair of 125 GeV scalars is also included. Based on a global
analysis of the current data, including not only a single 125 GeV scalar but
also another one with mass over the range 110 to 600 GeV, we obtain the
up-to-date exclusion contours in the parameter space. Side by side, regions
agreeing with the data within 68% and 95% confidence level based on a
\chi^2-minimisation procedure, are also presented.
