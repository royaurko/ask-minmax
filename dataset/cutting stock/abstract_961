We propose a new adequacy test and a graphical evaluation tool for nonlinear
dynamic models. The proposed techniques can be applied in any setup where
parametric conditional distribution of the data is specified, in particular to
models involving conditional volatility, conditional higher moments,
conditional quantiles, asymmetry, Value at Risk models, duration models,
diffusion models, etc. Compared to other tests, the new test properly controls
the nonlinear dynamic behavior in conditional distribution and does not rely on
smoothing techniques which require a choice of several tuning parameters. The
test is based on a new kind of multivariate empirical process of
contemporaneous and lagged probability integral transforms. We establish weak
convergence of the process under parameter uncertainty and local alternatives.
We justify a parametric bootstrap approximation that accounts for parameter
estimation effects often ignored in practice. Monte Carlo experiments show that
the test has good finite-sample size and power properties. Using the new test
and graphical tools we check the adequacy of various popular heteroscedastic
models for stock exchange index data.
