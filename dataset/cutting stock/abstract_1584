The latest NA49 results on event-by-event transverse momentum fluctuations
are presented for central Pb+Pb interactions over the whole SPS energy range
(20A - 158A GeV). Two different methods are applied: evaluating the
$\Phi_{p_{T}}$ fluctuation measure and studying two-particle transverse
momentum correlations. The obtained results are compared to predictions of the
UrQMD model. The results on the energy dependence are compared to the NA49 data
on the system size dependence. The NA61 (SHINE, NA49-future) strategy of
searching of the QCD critical end-point is also discussed.
