We construct the asymptotically flat charged thin-shell wormholes of Lovelock
gravity in seven dimensions by cut-and-paste technique, and apply the
generalized junction conditions in order to calculate the energy-momentum
tensor of these wormholes on the shell. We find that for negative second order
and positive third order Lovelock coefficients, there are thin-shell wormholes
that respect the weak energy condition. In this case, the amount of normal
matter decreases as the third order Lovelock coefficient increases. For
positive second and third order Lovelock coefficients, the weak energy
condition is violated and the amount of exotic matter decreases as the charge
increases. Finally, we perform a linear stability analysis against a symmetry
preserving perturbation, and find that the wormholes are stable provided the
derivative of surface pressure density with respect to surface energy density
is negative and the throat radius is chosen suitable.
