We have proposed novel measures based on the Kolmogorov complexity for use in
complex system behavior studies and time series analysis. We have considered
background of the Kolmogorov complexity and also we have discussed meaning of
the physical as well as other complexities. To get better insights into the
complexity of complex systems and time series analysis we have introduced the
three novel measures based on the Kolmogorov complexity: (i) the Kolmogorov
complexity spectrum, (ii) the Kolmogorov complexity spectrum highest value and
(iii) the overall Kolmogorov complexity. The characteristics of these measures
have been tested using a generalized logistic equation. Finally, the proposed
measures have been applied on different time series originating from: the model
output (the biochemical substance exchange in a multi-cell system), four
different geophysical phenomena (dynamics of: river flow, long term
precipitation, indoor 222Rn concentration and UV radiation dose) and economy
(stock prices dynamics). Results which are obtained offer deeper insights into
complexity of the system dynamics behavior and time series analysis when the
proposed complexity measures are applied.
