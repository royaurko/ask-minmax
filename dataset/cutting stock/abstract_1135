We propose a formula of time-series prediction by means of three states
random field Ising model (RFIM). At the economic crisis due to disasters or
international disputes, the stock price suddenly drops. The macroscopic
phenomena should be explained from the corresponding microscopic view point
because there are existing a huge number of active traders behind the crushes.
Hence, here we attempt to model the artificial financial market in which each
trader $i$ can choose his/her decision among `buying', `selling' or `staying
(taking a wait-and-see attitude)', each of which corresponds to a realization
of the three state Ising spin, namely, $S_{i}=+1$, -1 and $S_{i}=0$,
respectively. The decision making of traders is given by the Gibbs-Boltzmann
distribution with the energy function. The energy function contains three
distinct terms, namely, the ferromagnetic two-body interaction term (endogenous
information), random field term as external information (exogenous news), and
chemical potential term which controls the number of traders who are watching
the market calmly at the instance. We specify the details of the model system
from the past financial market data to determine the conjugate hyper-parameters
and draw each parameter flow as a function of time-step. Especially we will
examine to what extent one can characterize the crisis by means of a brand-new
order parameter --- `turnover' --- which is defined as the number of active
traders who post their decisions $S_{i}=1,-1$, instead of $S_{i}=0$.
