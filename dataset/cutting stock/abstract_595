The suggestion is made that air showers with energies beyond the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min spectral cut-off may have primary vertices some 6 km
lower in height than those of proton initiated showers with energies below the
GZK cut-off. This estimate is based on the assumption that post-GZK showers are
due to neutrinos having acquired strong interactions from generation-changing
dual gluon exchange as recently proposed.
