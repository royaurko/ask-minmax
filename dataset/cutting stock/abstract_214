We give three derivations of Polya's approximation for the expected range of
a simple random walk in one dimension. This result allows for an estimation of
the volatility of a financial instrument from the difference between the high
and low prices, or, equivalently, for an estimation of pi from the ratio of the
volatility to the difference between high and low prices.
