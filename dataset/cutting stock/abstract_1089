We report the formation of stable nanoparticle-polymer clusters obtained by
electrostatic complexation. The nanoparticles placed under scrutiny are
nanoceria (CeO2) coated by short poly(acrylic acid) moieties, whereas the
polymers are cationic-neutral block copolymers. The cluster formation was
monitored using different formulation pathways, including direct mixing,
dialysis, dilution and quenching. In the first process, the hybrids were
obtained by mixing stock solutions of polymers and nanoparticles. Dialysis and
dilution were based on controlled desalting kinetics according to methods
developed in molecular biology. The fourth process consisted in a rapid
dilution of the salted dispersions and as such it was regarded as a quench of
the cluster kinetics. We have found that one key parameter that controls the
kinetics of formation of electrostatic clusters is the rate dIS/dt at which the
salt is removed from the solution, where IS denotes the ionic strength. With
decreasing IS, the electrostatically screened polymers and nanoparticles system
undergo an abrupt transition between an unassociated and a clustered state. By
tuning the desalting kinetics, the size of the clusters was varied from 100 nm
to over 1 micrometer. At low ionic strength, the clusters were found to be
kinetically frozen. It is proposed that the onset of aggregation is driven by
the desorption-adsorption transition of the polymers onto the surfaces of the
particles.
