Obtaining more accurate equity value estimates is the starting point for
stock selection, value-based indexing in a noisy market, and beating benchmark
indices through tactical style rotation. Unfortunately, discounted cash flow,
method of comparables, and fundamental analysis typically yield discrepant
valuation estimates. Moreover, the valuation estimates typically disagree with
market price. Can one form a superior valuation estimate by averaging over the
individual estimates, including market price? This article suggests a Bayesian
framework for combining two or more estimates into a superior valuation
estimate. The framework justifies the common practice of averaging over several
estimates to arrive at a final point estimate.
