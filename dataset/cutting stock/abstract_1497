We present a parametric study of a nonlinear diffusion equation which
generalises Leith's model of a turbulent cascade to an arbitrary cascade having
a single conserved quantity. There are three stationary regimes depending on
whether the Kolmogorov exponent is greater than, less than or equal to the
equilibrium exponent. In the first regime, the large scale spectrum scales with
the Kolmogorov exponent. In the second regime, the large scale spectrum scales
with the equilibrium exponent so the system appears to be at equilibrium at
large scales. Furthermore, in this equilibrium-like regime, the amplitude of
the large-scale spectrum depends on the small scale cut-off. This is
interpreted as an analogue of cascade nonlocality. In the third regime, the
equilibrium spectrum acquires a logarithmic correction. An exact analysis of
the self-similar, non-stationary problem shows that time-evolving cascades have
direct analogues of these three regimes.
