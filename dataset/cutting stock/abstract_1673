Abridged: We present a spectral and temporal analysis of the Cathedral QPO
detected in the power density spectra of the microquasar XTE J1859+226 obtained
with RXTE. This type of QPO manifests as two peaks with similar amplitudes and
harmonically related centroid frequencies (~3 and ~6 Hz). The amplitude of the
~3 Hz feature varies in anticorrelation with the count rate, by about ~50. The
~6 Hz feature shows a slight increase (~7%) of its amplitude with count rate.
The RMS-spectra of the two peaks are quite different. The ~3 Hz feature is
softer than the other one, and shows a cut-off at an energy of ~6 keV while the
RMS of the 6 Hz increases up to at least 20 keV. We also study the bicoherence,
$b^2(\mu,\nu)$. The values b^2(~3,~3) and b^2(~6,~6) are rather high and
similar to the type C QPOs of GRS 1915+105. By comparison with the latter
source the fact that the bicoherence of the ~3 Hz feature is higher than that
of the other peak, would tend to indicate that the ~3 Hz is the fundamental
QPO. The value of b^2(~3,~6)$ is, however, low and therefore indicates a
behavior that is different than that seen in GRS 1915+105. We suggest that,
rather than pure harmonics, we may see different modes of the same underlying
phenomenon competing to produce QPOs at different frequencies.
