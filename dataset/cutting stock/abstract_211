Using data from 92 indices of stock exchanges worldwide, I analize the
cluster formation and evolution from 2007 to 2010, which includes the Subprime
Mortgage Crisis of 2008, using asset graphs based on distance thresholds. I
also study the survivability of connections and of clusters through time and
the influence of noise in centrality measures applied to the networks of
financial indices.
