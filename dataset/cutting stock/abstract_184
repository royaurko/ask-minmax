Modelling financial time series as a time change of a simpler process has
been proposed in various forms over the years. One of such recent approaches is
called volatility homogenisation decomposition, and has been designed
specifically to aid the forecasting of price changes on financial markets. The
contributors of this method have attempted to prove the its usefulness by applying a
specific forecasting procedure and determining the effectiveness of this
procedure on the decomposed time series, as compared with the original time
series. This is problematic in at least two ways. First, the choice of the
forecasting procedure obviously has an effect on the results, rendering them
non-exhaustive. Second, the results obtained were not completely convincing,
with some values falling under 50% guessing rate. Additionally, only nine
Australian stocks were being investigated, which further limits the scope of
this proof. In this study we propose to find the usefulness of volatility
homogenisation by calculating the predictability of the decomposed time series
and comparing it to the predictability of the original time series. We are
applying information-theoretic notion of entropy rate to quantify
predictability, which guarantees the result is not tied to a specific method of
prediction, and additionally we base our calculations on a large number of
stocks from the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
