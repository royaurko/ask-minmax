Our purpose is to relate the Fokker-Planck formalism proposed by [Friedrich
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 5224 (2000)] for the distribution of stock market
returns to the empirically well-established power law distribution with an
exponent in the range 3-5. We show how to use Friedrich et al.'s formalism to
predict that the distribution of returns is indeed asymptotically a power law
with an exponent mu that can be determined from the Kramers-Moyal coefficients
determined by Friedrich et al. However, with their values determined for the
U.S. dollar-German mark exchange rates, the exponent mu predicted from their
theory is found around 12, in disagreement with the often-quoted value between
3 and 5. This could be explained by the fact that the large asymptotic value of
12 does not apply to real data that lie still far from the stationary state of
the Fokker-Planck description. Another possibility is that power laws are
inadequate. The mechanism for the power law is based on the presence of
multiplicative noise across time-scales, which is different from the
multiplicative noise at fixed time-scales implicit in the ARCH models developed
in the Finance literature.
