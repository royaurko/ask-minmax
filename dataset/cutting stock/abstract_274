Neutron scattering is used to probe antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in
the d-wave heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_{5}$ (T$_{c}$=2.3 K).
Superconductivity develops from a state with slow ($\hbar\Gamma$=0.3 $\pm$ 0.15
meV) commensurate (${\bf{Q_0}}$=(1/2,1/2,1/2)) antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuations and nearly isotropic spin correlations. The characteristic
wavevector in CeCoIn$_{5}$ is the same as CeIn$_{3}$ but differs from the
incommensurate wavevector measured in antiferromagnetically ordered
CeRhIn$_{5}$. A sharp spin resonance ($\hbar\Gamma<0.07$ meV) at $\hbar \omega$
= 0.60 $\pm$ 0.03 meV develops in the superconducting state removing spectral
weight from low-energy transfers. The presence of a resonance peak is
indicative of strong coupling between f-electron magnetism and
superconductivity and consistent with a d-wave gap order parameter satisfying
$\Delta({\bf q+Q_0})=-\Delta({\bf q})$.
