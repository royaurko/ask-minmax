We review recent results on a mean-field model for relativistic electrons in
atoms and molecules, which allows to describe at the same time the
self-consistent behavior of the polarized Dirac sea. We quickly derive this
model from Quantum Electrodynamics and state the existence of solutions,
imposing an ultraviolet cut-off $\Lambda$. We then discuss the limit
$\Lambda\to\infty$ in detail, by resorting to charge renormalization.
