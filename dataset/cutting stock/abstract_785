We address the problem of multiresolution module detection in dense weighted
networks, where the modular structure is encoded in the weights rather than
topology. We discuss a weighted version of the q-state Potts method, which was
originally introduced by Reichardt and Bornholdt. This weighted method can be
directly applied to dense networks. We discuss the dependence of the resolution
of the method on its tuning parameter and network properties, using sparse and
dense weighted networks with built-in modules as example cases. Finally, we
apply the method to data on stock price correlations, and show that the
resulting modules correspond well to known structural properties of this
correlation network.
