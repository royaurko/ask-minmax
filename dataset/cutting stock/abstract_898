We propose a new sequential procedure to detect change in the parameters of a
process $ X= (X_t)_{t\in \Z}$ belonging to a large class of causal models (such
as AR($\infty$), ARCH($\infty$), TARCH($\infty$), ARMA-GARCH processes). The
procedure is based on a difference between the historical parameter estimator
and the updated parameter estimator, where both these estimators are based on a
quasi-likelihood of the model. Unlike classical recursive fluctuation test, the
updated estimator is computed without the historical observations. The
asymptotic behavior of the test is studied and the consistency in power as well
as an upper bound of the detection delay are obtained. Some simulation results
are reported with comparisons to some other existing procedures exhibiting the
accuracy of our new procedure. The procedure is also applied to the daily
closing values of the Nikkei 225, S$&$P 500 and FTSE 100 stock index. We show
in this real-data applications how the procedure can be used to solve off-line
multiple breaks detection.
