We have conducted pointed redshift surveys for galaxies in the direction of
bright AGN whose HST far-UV spectra contain nearby (cz <~ 30,000 kms), low
column density (12.5 <= log N_{HI} (cm s^{-2}) <= 14.5) Ly-alpha forest
absorption systems. Here we present results for four lines-of-sight which
contain nearby (cz <~ 3000 kms) Ly-alpha absorbers in galaxy voids. Although
our data go quite deep (-13 <= M_{B}(limit) <= -14) out to impact parameters of
100-250 h_{70}^{-1} kpc, these absorbers remain isolated and thus appear to be
truly intergalactic, rather than part of galaxies or their halos. Since we and
others have discovered no galaxies in voids, the only baryons detected in the
voids are in the Ly-alpha ``clouds''. Using a photoionization model for these
clouds, the total baryonic content of the voids is 4.5% +/- 1.5% of the mean
baryon density.
