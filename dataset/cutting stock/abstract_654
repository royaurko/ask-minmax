In this article we present new results for the pricing of arithmetic Asian
options within a Black-Scholes context. To derive these results we make
extensive use of the local scale invariance that exists in the theory of
contingent claim pricing. This allows us to derive, in a natural way, a simple
PDE for the price of arithmetic Asians options. In the case of European average
strike options, a proper choice of numeraire reduces the dimension of this PDE
to one, leading to a PDE similar to the one derived by Rogers and Shi. We solve
this PDE, finding a Laplace-transform representation for the price of average
strike options, both seasoned and unseasoned. This extends the results of Geman
and Yor, who discussed the case of average price options. Next we use symmetry
arguments to show that prices of average strike and average price options can
be expressed in terms of each other. Finally we show, again using symmetries,
that plain vanilla options on stocks paying known cash dividends are closely
related to arithmetic Asians, so that all the new techniques can be directly
applied to this case.
