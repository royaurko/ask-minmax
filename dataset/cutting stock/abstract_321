This paper presents performance analysis of hybrid model comprise of
concordance and Genetic Programming (GP) to forecast financial market with some
existing models. This scheme can be used for in depth analysis of stock market.
Different measures of concordances such as Kendalls Tau, Ginis Mean Difference,
Spearmans Rho, and weak interpretation of concordance are used to search for
the pattern in past that look similar to present. Genetic Programming is then
used to match the past trend to present trend as close as possible. Then
Genetic Program estimates what will happen next based on what had happened
next. The concept is validated using financial time series data (S&P 500 and
NASDAQ indices) as sample data sets. The forecasted result is then compared
with standard ARIMA model and other model to analyse its performance.
