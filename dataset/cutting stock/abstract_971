We consider a market model that consists of financial investors and producers
of a commodity. Producers optionally store some production for future sale and
go short on forward contracts to hedge their future commodity price
uncertainty. On the other hand, speculators invest in these contracts to
diversify their portfolios. The forward and the spot equilibrium commodity
prices are endogenously derived as the outcome of the interaction between
producers and speculators. Assuming that both are utility maximizers and that
the demand shocks and the exogenously priced financial market are correlated,
we provide semi-explicit expressions for the equilibrium prices and analyze
their dependence on the model parameters. The model can explain why increased
speculators' participation in forward commodity markets and higher correlation
between the commodity and the stock market could result in higher spot prices
and lower forward premia.
