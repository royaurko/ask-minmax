Stock price change in financial market occurs through transactions in analogy
with diffusion in stochastic physical systems. The analysis of price changes in
real markets shows that long-range correlations of price fluctuations largely
depend on the number of transactions. We introduce the multiplicative
stochastic model of time interval between trades and analyze spectral density
and correlations of the number of transactions. The model reproduces spectral
properties of the real markets and explains the mechanism of power law
distribution of trading activity. Our study provides an evidence that
statistical properties of financial markets are enclosed in the statistics of
the time interval between trades. Multiplicative stochastic diffusion may serve
as a consistent model for this statistics.
