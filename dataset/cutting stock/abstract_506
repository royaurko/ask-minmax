In this work we study the problem of constructing stochastic processes with a
predetermined covariance decay by parameterizing its marginals and a given
family of copulas. We present several examples to illustrate the theory,
including the important Gaussian and Euclidean families of copulas. We
associate the theory to common applied time series models and present a general
methodology to estimate a given parameter of interest identifiable through the
process' covariance decay. To exemplify the proposed methodology, we present
simple Monte Carlo applications to parameter estimation in time series. The
methodology is also applied to the S&P500 US stock market index.
