Recent studies have revealed a number of striking dependence patterns in high
frequency stock price dynamics characterizing probabilistic interrelation
between two consequent price increments x (push) and y (response) as described
by the bivariate probability distribution P(x,y) [1,2,3,4]. There are two
properties, the market mill asymmetries of P(x,y) and predictability due to
nonzero z-shaped mean conditional response, that are of special importance.
Main goal of the present paper is to put together a model reproducing both the
z-shaped mean conditional response and the market mill asymmetry of P(x,y) with
respect to the axis y=0. We develop a probabilistic model based on a
multi-component ansatz for conditional distribution P(y|x) with push-dependent
weights and means describing both properties. A relationship between the market
mill asymmetry and predictability is discussed. A possible connection of the
model to agent-based picture is outlined.
