We study the use of polarization asymmetries at a muon collider to determine
the CP-even and CP-odd couplings of a Higgs boson to $\mu^+mu^-$. We determine
achievable accuracy as a function of beam polarization and luminosity. The
appropriate techniques for dealing with the polarization precession are
outlined. Strategies especially appropriate for a two-Higgs-doublet model
(including the MSSM) are given. Our general conclusion is that polarization
will be very useful, especially if the proton source is such that full
luminosity in the storage ring can be retained even after imposing cuts on the
originally accepted muons necessary for $P\gsim 0.4$ for each beam.
