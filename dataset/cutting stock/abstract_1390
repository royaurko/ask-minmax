In this note, we consider dijet production at gamma gamma colliders as a
probe of recently proposed, large extra-dimensional gravity models. The
exchange of virtual, spin-2 graviton towers (Kaluza-Klein excitations)
significantly modifies the cross section, as compared to the Standard Model
predictions. We find that, in order to maximize the value of the effective
scale that can be probed at a given center-of-mass energy, a very severe p_T
cut should be applied; in general, a p_T equal to approximately 46% of the e^+
e^- beam energy gives the highest reach. We find that we can probe the
effective mass scale from about 2.7 TeV to 11.1 TeV, depending on the
center-of-mass energy and assumptions about the model.
