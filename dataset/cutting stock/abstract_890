We report measurements of the neutron diffuse scattering in a single crystal
of the relaxor ferroelectric material 95.5%Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-4.5%PbTiO3
(PZN-4.5%PT). We show that the diffuse scattering at high temperatures has a
quasielastic component with energy width $\agt$ 0.1 meV. On cooling the total
diffuse scattering intensity increases, but the intensity and the energy width
of the quasielastic component gradually diminish. At 50 K the diffuse
scattering is completely static (i.e.the energy width lies within the limits of
our instrumental resolution). This suggests that the dynamics of the
short-range correlated atomic displacements associated with the diffuse
scattering freeze at low temperature. We find that this depends on the wave
vector q as the quasielastic diffuse scattering intensities associated with
<001> (T1-type) and <110> (T2-type) atomic displacements vary differently with
temperature and electric field.
