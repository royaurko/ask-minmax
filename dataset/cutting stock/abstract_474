We propose a prediction model based on the minority game in which traders
continuously evaluate a complete set of trading strategies with different
memory lengths using the strategies' past performance. Based on the chosen
trading strategy they determine their prediction of the movement for the
following time period of a single asset. We find empirically using stocks from
the S&P500 that our prediction model yields a high success rate of over 51.5%
and produces higher returns than a buy-and-hold strategy. Even when taking into
account trading costs we find that using the predictions will generate superior
investment portfolios.
