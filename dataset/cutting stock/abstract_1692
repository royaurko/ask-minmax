The fully differential angular distribution for the rare flavor-changing
neutral current decay \bar{B}_d^0 -> \bar{K}^{*0} (-> K- pi+) mu+ mu- is
studied. The emphasis is placed on accurate treatment of the contribution from
the processes \bar{B}_d^0 -> \bar{K}^{*0} (-> K- pi+) V with intermediate
vector resonances V = rho(770), omega(782), phi(1020), J/psi, psi(2S), ...
decaying into the mu+ mu- pair. The dilepton invariant-mass dependence of the
branching ratio, longitudinal polarization fraction f_L of the \bar{K}^{*0}
meson, and forward-backward asymmetry A_{FB} is calculated and compared with
data from Belle, CDF and LHCb. It is shown that inclusion of the resonance
contribution may considerably modify the branching ratio, calculated in the SM
without resonances, even in the invariant-mass region far from the so-called
charmonia cuts applied in the experimental analyses. This conclusion crucially
depends on values of the unknown phases of the B^0 -> K^{*0} J/psi and B^0 ->
K^{*0} psi(2S) decay amplitudes with zero helicity.
