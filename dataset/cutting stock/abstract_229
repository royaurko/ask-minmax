Option pricing formulas are derived from a non-Gaussian model of stock
returns. Fluctuations are assumed to evolve according to a nonlinear
Fokker-Planck equation which maximizes the Tsallis nonextensive entropy of
index $q$. A generalized form of the Black-Scholes differential equation is
found, and we derive a martingale measure which leads to closed form solutions
for European call options. The standard Black-Scholes pricing equations are
recovered as a special case ($q = 1$). The distribution of stock returns is
well-modelled with $q$ circa 1.5. Using that value of $q$ in the option pricing
model we reproduce the volatility smile. The partial derivatives (or Greeks) of
the model are also calculated. Empirical results are demonstrated for options
on Japanese Yen futures. Using just one value of $\sigma$ across strikes we
closely reproduce market prices, for expiration times ranging from weeks to
several months.
