We study the sensitivity of our recent MSTW 2008 NLO and NNLO PDF analyses to
the values of the charm- and bottom-quark masses, and we provide additional
public PDF sets for a wide range of these heavy-quark masses. We quantify the
impact of varying m_c and m_b on the cross sections for W, Z and Higgs
production at the Tevatron and the LHC. We generate 3- and 4-flavour versions
of the (5-flavour) MSTW 2008 PDFs by evolving the input PDFs and alpha_S
determined from fits in the 5-flavour scheme, including the eigenvector PDF
sets necessary for calculation of PDF uncertainties. As an example of their
use, we study the difference in the Z total cross sections at the Tevatron and
LHC in the 4- and 5-flavour schemes. Significant differences are found,
illustrating the need to resum large logarithms in Q^2/m_b^2 by using the
5-flavour scheme. The 4-flavour scheme is still necessary, however, if cuts are
imposed on associated (massive) b-quarks, as is the case for the experimental
measurement of Z b bbar production and similar processes.
