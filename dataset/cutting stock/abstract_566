Recent large scale Galactic Plane H$\alpha$ surveys allow a re-examination of
the environs of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars for the presence of a circumstellar
nebula. Using the morphologies of WR nebulae known to be composed of stellar
ejecta as a guide, we constructed ejecta nebula criteria similar to those of
Chu (1991) and searched for likely WR ejecta nebula in the SHS H$\alpha$
survey. A new Wolf-Rayet ejecta nebula around WR 8 is found and its morphology
discussed. The fraction of WR stars with ejecta type nebulae is roughly
consistent between the MilkyWay (MW) and LMC at around 5-6%, with the MW sample
dominated by nitrogen rich WR central stars (WN type) and the LMC stars having
a higher proportion of carbon rich WR central stars (WC type). We compare our
results with those of previous surveys, including those of Marston (1997) and
Miller & Chu (1993), and find broad consistency. We investigate several trends
in the sample: most of the clear examples of ejecta nebulae have WNh central
stars; and very few ejecta nebulae have binary central stars. Finally, the
possibly unique evolutionary status of the nebula around the binary star WR 71
is explored.
