We develop a model of how information flows into a market, and derive
algorithms for automatically detecting and explaining relevant events. We
analyze data from twenty-two "political stock markets" (i.e., betting markets
on political outcomes) on the Iowa Electronic Market (IEM). We prove that,
under certain efficiency assumptions, prices in such betting markets will on
average approach the correct outcomes over time, and show that IEM data
conforms closely to the theory. We present a simple model of a betting market
where information is revealed over time, and show a qualitative correspondence
between the model and real market data. We also present an algorithm for
automatically detecting significant events and generating semantic explanations
of their origin. The algorithm operates by discovering significant changes in
vocabulary on online news sources (using expected entropy loss) that align with
major price spikes in related betting markets.
