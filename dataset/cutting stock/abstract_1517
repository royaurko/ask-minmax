In this work, we study the light stop pair signals at the LHC. We explore the
SUSY parameter space with non-universal gaugino and third generation masses at
the GUT scale. Recent LHC SUSY search results based on 35pb$^{-1}$ and
1fb$^{-1}$ of data are implemented to put the limits on stop pair events. The
dark matter relic density and direct detection constraints are also taken into
account. Detailed simulations on the signals and background for some benchmark
points are performed, and it is found that the stop pair signals usually escape
the LHC search if the present cut conditions are used. We also explore the
potential and sensitivity of ILC to probe such scenarios. It is found that the
ILC can detect them with an integrated luminosity of a few tens of fb$^{-1}$.
