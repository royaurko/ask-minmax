We provide a framework for proofs of structural theorems about sets with
positive Banach logarithmic density. For example, we prove that if $A\subseteq
\mathbb{N}$ has positive Banach logarithmic density, then $A$ contains an
approximate geometric progression of any length. We also prove that if
$A,B\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ have positive Banach logarithmic density, then there
are arbitrarily long intervals whose gaps on $A\cdot B$ are multiplicatively
bounded, a multiplicative version Jin's sumset theorem. The main technical tool
is the use of a quotient of a Loeb measure space with respect to a
multiplicative cut.
