The emergence of the digital media and computational tools has widened the
doors for creativity. The cutting edge in the digital arts and role of new
technologies can be explored for the possible creativity. This gives an
opportunity to involve arts with technologies to make creative works. The
interactive artworks are often installed in the places where multiple people
can interact with the installation, which allows the art to achieve its purpose
by allowing the people to observe and involve with the installation. The level
of engagement of the audience depends on the various factors such as aesthetic
satisfaction, how the audience constructs meaning, pleasure and enjoyment. The
method to evaluate these experiences is challenging as it depends on
integration between the artificial life and real life by means of human
computer interaction. This research investigates "How Adriano fits for creative
and interactive artwork installations?" using an artwork installation in the
campus of NTNU (Norwegian University of Science & Technology). The main focus
of this investigation has been to get an overview on the intersection between
information technology and Arts. This gives an opportunity to understand
various attributes like creativity, cooperation and openness of processes
influencing the creative Artworks. The artwork is combination of Adriano and
other auxiliary components such as sensors, LED's and speakers.
