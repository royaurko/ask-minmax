In this report I present a possible scenario which can lead to the emergence
of a generalised Gamma distribution first presented by R. Osorio et al. as the
distribution of traded volumes of stocks in financial markets. This propose is
related with superstatics and the notion of moving average commonly used in
econometrics.
