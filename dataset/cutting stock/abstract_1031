We present an observation of the radio-galaxy 3C401 and the surrounding
intracluster medium (ICM) of its host galaxy cluster by the Chandra X-ray
Observatory. This luminous radio-galaxy is notable in that it has
characteristics intermediate between the FRI and FRII morphologies. We clearly
detect point-like emission coincident with the radio-core of 3C401, although
the spatial resolution of even Chandra is only 2kpc at the distance of 3C401
(z=0.201) and so the possibility remains that this is a dense (and rapidly
cooling) thermal gaseous core in the center of the ICM atmosphere. Strong
departures from spherical symmetry in the central 10-20kpc of the ICM clearly
suggest interaction between the ICM and the radio-lobes of 3C401. A central
X-ray bar probably results from the evacuation of two ICM cavities by the
expanding radio lobes. Beyond these central regions, the cluster possesses a
flatter profile than many clusters of comparable mass suggesting the importance
of ICM heating and entropy injection by 3C401. We detect an interesting
cross-like structure in the ICM on 100kpc scales. We speculate that this could
be a radio-galaxy induced disturbance corresponding to a time when 3C401 was
substantially more powerful. A particularly exciting possibility is that this
cross-like structure corresponds to a large scale global g-mode oscillation
excited by a past outburst of 3C401.
