The extremal index parameter theta characterizes the degree of local
dependence in the extremes of a stationary time series and has important
applications in a number of areas, such as hydrology, telecommunications,
finance and environmental studies. In this study, a novel estimator for theta
based on the asymptotic scaling of block-maxima and resampling is introduced.
It is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal for a large class of
m-dependent time series. Further, a procedure for the automatic selection of
its tuning parameter is developed and different types of confidence intervals
that prove useful in practice proposed. The performance of the estimator is
examined through simulations, which show its highly competitive behavior.
Finally, the estimator is applied to three real data sets of daily crude oil
prices, daily returns of the S&P 500 stock index, and high-frequency, intra-day
traded volumes of a stock. These applications demonstrate additional diagnostic
features of statistical plots based on the new estimator.
