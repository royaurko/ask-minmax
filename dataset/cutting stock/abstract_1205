The KADoNiS-$p$ project is an online database for cross sections relevant to
the $p$-process. All existing experimental data was collected and reviewed.
With this contribution a user-friendly database using the KADoNiS (Karlsruhe
Astrophysical Database of Nucleosynthesis in Stars) framework is launched,
including all available experimental data from (p,$\gamma$), (p,n),
(p,$\alpha$), ($\alpha$,$\gamma$), ($\alpha$,n) and ($\alpha$,p) reactions in
or close to the respective Gamow window with cut-off date of August 2012
(www.kadonis.org/pprocess).
