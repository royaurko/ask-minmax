The momentum correlation between protons and lambda particles emitted from
central Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt(s_{NN}) = 17.3 GeV was studied by the NA49
experiment at the CERN SPS. A clear enhancement is observed for small relative
momenta (q_{inv} < 0.2 GeV). By fitting a theoretical model, which uses the
strong interaction between the proton and the lambda in a given pair, to the
measured data a value for the effective source size is deduced. Assuming a
static Gaussian source distribution we derive an effective radius parameter of
R_G = 3.02 \pm 0.20$(stat.)^{+0.44}_{-0.16}(syst.) fm.
