The search for the Higgs boson produced by Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) where
the Higgs decays into W pairs and thence to leptons plus neutrinos is discussed
at the Monte Carlo generator level. In particular, the cuts which are applied
in order to reduce backgrounds are almost exactly those used to extract the VBF
production of Z bosons.
