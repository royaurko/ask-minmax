We reconsider the problem of option pricing using historical probability
distributions. We first discuss how the risk-minimisation scheme proposed
recently is an adequate starting point under the realistic assumption that
price increments are uncorrelated (but not necessarily independent) and of
arbitrary probability density. We discuss in particular how, in the Gaussian
limit, the Black-Scholes results are recovered, including the fact that the
average return of the underlying stock disappears from the price (and the
hedging strategy). We compare this theory to real option prices and find these
reflect in a surprisingly accurate way the subtle statistical features of the
underlying asset fluctuations.
