We measure the influence of different time-scales on the dynamics of
financial market data. This is obtained by decomposing financial time series
into simple oscillations associated with distinct time-scales. We propose two
new time-varying measures: 1) an amplitude scaling exponent and 2) an entropy
like measure. We apply these measures to intra-day, 30-second sampled prices of
various stock indices. Our results reveal intra-day trends where different
time-horizons contribute with variable relative amplitudes over the course of
the trading day. Our findings indicate that the time series we analysed have a
non-stationary multi-fractional nature with predominantly persistent behaviour
at the middle of the trading session and anti-persistent behaviour at the open
and close. We demonstrate that these deviations are statistically significant
and robust.
