We analyze the sequence of time intervals between consecutive stock trades of
thirty companies representing eight sectors of the U. S. economy over a period
of four years. For all companies we find that: (i) the probability density
function of intertrade times may be fit by a Weibull distribution; (ii) when
appropriately rescaled the probability densities of all companies collapse onto
a single curve implying a universal functional form; (iii) the intertrade times
exhibit power-law correlated behavior within a trading day and a consistently
greater degree of correlation over larger time scales, in agreement with the
correlation behavior of the absolute price returns for the corresponding
company, and (iv) the magnitude series of intertrade time increments is
characterized by long-range power-law correlations suggesting the presence of
nonlinear features in the trading dynamics, while the sign series is
anti-correlated at small scales. Our results suggest that independent of
industry sector, market capitalization and average level of trading activity,
the series of intertrade times exhibit possibly universal scaling patterns,
which may relate to a common mechanism underlying the trading dynamics of
diverse companies. Further, our observation of long-range power-law
correlations and a parallel with the crossover in the scaling of absolute price
returns for each individual stock, support the hypothesis that the dynamics of
transaction times may play a role in the process of price formation.
