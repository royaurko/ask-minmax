This paper examines volatility in REITs using a multivariate GARCH based
model. The Multivariate VAR-GARCH technique documents the return and volatility
linkages between REIT sub-sectors and also examines the influence of other US
equity series. The motivation is for investors to incorporate time-varyng
volatility and correlations in their portfolio selection. The results
illustrate the differences in results when higher frequency daily data is
tested in comparison to the monthly data that has been commonly used in the
existing literature. The linkages both within the REIT sector and between REITs
and related sectors such as value stocks are weaker than commonly found in
monthly studies. The broad market would appear to be more influential in the
daily case.
