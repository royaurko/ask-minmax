We study the effect of investor inertia on stock price fluctuations with a
market microstructure model comprising many small investors who are inactive
most of the time. It turns out that semi-Markov processes are tailor made for
modelling inert investors. With a suitable scaling, we show that when the price
is driven by the market imbalance, the log price process is approximated by a
process with long range dependence and non-Gaussian returns distributions,
driven by a fractional Brownian motion. Consequently, investor inertia may lead
to arbitrage opportunities for sophisticated market participants. The
mathematical contributions are a functional central limit theorem for
stationary semi-Markov processes, and approximation results for stochastic
integrals of continuous semimartingales with respect to fractional Brownian
motion.
