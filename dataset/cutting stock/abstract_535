We describe the impact of the intra-day activity pattern on the
autocorrelation function estimator. We obtain an exact formula relating
estimators of the autocorrelation functions of non-stationary process to its
stationary counterpart. Hence, we proved that the day seasonality of
inter-transaction times extends the memory of as well the process itself as its
absolute value. That is, both processes relaxation to zero is longer.
