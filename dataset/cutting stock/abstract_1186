The isostatic state plays a central role in organizing the response of many
amorphous materials. We demonstrate the existence of a dynamic critical length
scale in nearly isostatic spring networks that is valid both above and below
isostaticity and at finite frequencies, and use scaling arguments to relate the
length scale to viscoelastic response. We predict theoretically and verify
numerically how proximity to isostaticity controls the viscosity, shear
modulus, and creep of random networks.
