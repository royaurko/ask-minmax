In the framework of an incomplete financial market where the stock price
dynamics are modeled by a continuous semimartingale, an explicit first-order
expansion formula for the power investor's value function - seen as a function
of the underlying market price of risk process - is provided and its
second-order error is quantified. Two specific calibrated numerical examples
illustrating the accuracy of the method are also given.
