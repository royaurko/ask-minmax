Tidal stripping and three-body interactions with the central supermassive
black hole may eject stars from the Milky Way. These stars would comprise a set
of `intragroup' stars that trace the past history of interactions in our
galactic neighborhood. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7, we identify
candidate solar metallicity red giant intragroup stars using color cuts that
are designed to exclude nearby M and L dwarfs. We present 677 intragroup
candidates that are selected between 300 kpc and 2 Mpc, and are either the
reddest intragroup candidates (M7-M10) or are L dwarfs at larger distances than
previously detected.
