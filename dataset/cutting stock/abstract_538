We study the non-selfadjoint Dirac system on the line having an
non-integrable regular singularity in an interior point with additional
matching conditions at the singular point. Special fundamental systems of
solutions are constructed with prescribed analytic and asymptotic properties.
Behavior of the corresponding Stockes multipliers is established. These
fundamental systems of solutions will be used for studying direct and inverse
problems of spectral analysis.
