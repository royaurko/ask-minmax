The distance contraction, as observed in electrical soundings over
horizontally stratified earth (static system), is identified as a counterpart
of Doppler shift in dynamical systems. Identification of Doppler-like effect in
a stock-still systems makes it possible to give an al-ternative answer to the
question about an effective cause of the Doppler shift, which sounds: the
inhomogeneities. This answer opens different static as well as kinematic
possibilities, which challenge established theories of expanding universe and
energizing big bang.The energy propagating in stratified universe of layers
exhibits a shift which could be at-tributed not only to the expansion (Hubble's
theory) but alternatively to fluctuations in material properties
(inhomogeneities).
