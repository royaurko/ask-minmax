We present an updated study of the systematic errors in the measurements of
the electroweak boson cross-sections at the LHC for various experimental cuts
for a center of mass energy of 7, 10 and 14 TeV. The size of both electroweak
and NNLO QCD contributions are estimated, together with the systematic error
from the parton distributions. The effects of new versions of the MSTW, CTEQ,
and NNPDF PDFs are considered.
