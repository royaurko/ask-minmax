Deep, ground based, optical wide-field supernova searches are capable of
detecting a large number of supernovae over a broad redshift range up to z~1.5.
While it is practically unfeasible to obtain spectroscopic redshifts of all the
supernova candidates right after the discovery, we show that the magnitudes and
colors of the host galaxies, as well as the supernovae, can be used to select
high-z supernova candidates, for subsequent spectroscopic and photometric
follow-up.
  Using Monte-Carlo simulations we construct criteria for selecting galaxies in
well-defined redshift bands. For example, with a selection criteria using B-R
and R-I colors we are able to pick out potential host galaxies for which z>0.85
with 80% confidence level and with a selection efficiency of 64-86%. The method
was successfully tested using real observations from the HDF.
  Similarly, we show that that the magnitude and colors of the supernova
discovery data can be used to constrain the redshift. With a set of cuts based
on V-R and R-I in a search to m_I~25, supernovae at z~1 can be selected in a
redshift interval sigma_z <0.15.
