This paper deals with the notion of a large financial market and the concepts
of asymptotic arbitrage and strong asymptotic arbitrage (both of the first
kind), introduced by Yu.M. Kabanov and D.O. Kramkov. We show that the arbitrage
properties of a large market are completely determined by the asymptotic
behavior of the sequence of the num\'eraire portfolios, related to the small
markets. The obtained criteria can be expressed in terms of contiguity, entire
separation and Hellinger integrals, provided these notions are extended to
sub-probability measures. As examples we consider market models on finite
probability spaces, semimartingale and diffusion models. Also a discrete-time
infinite horizon market model with one log-normal stock is examined.
