We develop a finite horizon continuous time market model, where risk averse
investors maximize utility from terminal wealth by dynamically investing in a
risk-free money market account, a stock written on a default-free dividend
process, and a defaultable bond, whose prices are determined via equilibrium.
We analyze financial contagion arising endogenously between the stock and the
defaultable bond via the interplay between equilibrium behavior of investors,
risk preferences and cyclicality properties of the default intensity. We find
that the equilibrium price of the stock experiences a jump at default, despite
that the default event has no causal impact on the dividend process. We
characterize the direction of the jump in terms of a relation between investor
preferences and the cyclicality properties of the default intensity. We conduct
similar analysis for the market price of risk and for the investor wealth
process, and determine how heterogeneity of preferences affects the exposure to
default carried by different investors.
