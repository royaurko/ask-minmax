We propose a non-Abelian generalization of the Clebsch parameterization for a
vector in three dimensions. The construction is based on a group-theoretical
reduction of the Chern-Simons form on a symmetric space. The formalism is then
used to give a canonical (symplectic) discussion of non-Abelian fluid
mechanics, analogous to the way the Abelian Clebsch parameterization allows a
canonical description of conventional fluid mechanics.
