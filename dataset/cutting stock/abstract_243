Spatially resolved neutron diffraction as a function of crystal depth in
Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_{3}$ reveals the presence of a distinct near-surface
region. A dramatic change in both the lattice constant and the Bragg peak
intensity as a function of crystal depth is observed to occur in this region
over a length scale $\sim$ 100 $\mu$m. This confirms a previous assertion,
based on a comparison between high-energy x-rays and neutrons, that such a near
surface region exists in the relaxors. Consequences to both single crystal and
powder diffraction measurements and previous bulk neutron diffraction
measurements on large single crystals are discussed.
