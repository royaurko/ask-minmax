The dynamics of a complex system is usually recorded in the form of time
series, which can be studied through its visibility graph from a complex
network perspective. We investigate the visibility graphs extracted from
fractional Brownian motions and multifractal random walks, and find that the
degree distributions exhibit power-law behaviors, in which the power-law
exponent $\alpha$ is a linear function of the Hurst index $H$ of the time
series. We also find that the degree distribution of the visibility graph is
mainly determined by the temporal correlation of the original time series with
minor influence from the possible multifractal nature. As an example, we study
the visibility graphs constructed from two Chinese stock market indexes and
unveil that the degree distributions have power-law tails, where the tail
exponents of the visibility graphs and the Hurst indexes of the indexes are
close to the $\alpha\sim H$ linear relationship.
