The conjecture of Bollob\'as and Koml\'os, recently proved by B\"ottcher,
Schacht, and Taraz [Math. Ann. 343(1), 175--205, 2009], implies that for any
$\gamma>0$, every balanced bipartite graph on $2n$ vertices with bounded degree
and sublinear bandwidth appears as a subgraph of any $2n$-vertex graph $G$ with
minimum degree $(1+\gamma)n$, provided that $n$ is sufficiently large. We show
that this threshold can be cut in half to an essentially best-possible minimum
degree of $(\frac12+\gamma)n$ when we have the additional structural
information of the host graph $G$ being balanced bipartite. This complements
results of Zhao [to appear in SIAM J. Discrete Math.], as well as Hladk\'y and
Schacht [to appear in SIAM J. Discrete Math.], who determined a corresponding
minimum degree threshold for $K_{r,s}$-factors, with $r$ and $s$ fixed.
Moreover, it implies that the set of Hamilton cycles of $G$ is a generating
system for its cycle space.
