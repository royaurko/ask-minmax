We present elastic and inelastic neutron scattering results on highly oxygen
ordered YBa2Cu3O6.5 ortho-II. We find no evidence for the presence of ordered
magnetic moments to a sensitivity of 0.003 Bohr magnetons, an order of
magnitude smaller than has been suggested in theories of orbital or
d-density-wave (DDW) currents. The absence of sharp elastic peaks, shows that
the d-density-wave phase is not present, at least for the superconductor with
the doping of 6.5 and the ordered ortho-II structure. We cannot exclude the
possibility that a broad peak may exist with extremely short-range DDW
correlations. For less ordered or more doped crystals it is possible that
disorder may lead to static magnetism. We have also searched for the large
normal state spin gap that is predicted to exist in an ordered DDW phase.
Instead of a gap we find that the Q-correlated spin susceptibility persists to
the lowest energies studied, 6 meV. Our results are compatible with the
coexistence of superconductivity with orbital currents, but only if they are
dynamic, and exclude a sharp phase transition to an ordered d-density-wave
phase.
