The possibility in principle of the determining high energy photon circular
polarization by the measurement of the created electron polarization in the
process of triplet photoproduction $\gamma +e^-\rightarrow e^+e^- +e^-$ is
investigated. The respective event number which depend on polarization states
of photon and created electron does not decrease with the growth of the photon
energy, and this circumstance can ensure the high efficiency in such kind of
experiments. We study different double and single distributions of the created
electron (or positron), which allow to probe the photon circular polarization
and to measure its magnitude (the Stock's parameter $\xi_2$), using the
technique of the Sudakov's variables. Some experimental setups with different
rules for event selection are studied and corresponding numerical estimations
are presented.
