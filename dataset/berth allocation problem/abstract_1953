Problem 540 of J. D. Lawson and M. Mislove in Open Problems in Topology asks
whether the process of taking duals terminate after finitely many steps with
topologies that are duals of each other. The problem for $T_1$ spaces was
already solved by G. E. Strecker in 1966. For certain topologies on hyperspaces
(which are not necessarily $T_1$), the main question was in the positive
answered by Bruce S. Burdick and his solution was presented on The First
Turkish International Conference on Topology in Istanbul in 2000. In this paper
we bring a complete and positive solution of the problem for all topological
spaces. We show that for any topological space $(X,\tau)$ it follows
$\tau^{dd}=\tau^{dddd}$. Further, we classify topological spaces with respect
to the number of generated topologies by the process of taking duals.
