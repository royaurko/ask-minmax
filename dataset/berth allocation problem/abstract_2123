The structure of the electric field in a plasma has been elucidated for the
skin effect problem. An expression for the distribution function in the
half-space and the electric field profile have been obtained in the explicit
form. The absolute value, the real part, and the imaginary part of the electric
filed have been analyzed in the case of the anomalous skin effect near to a
plasma resonance. It has been demonstrated that the electric field in the skin
effect problem is predominantly determined by the discrete spectrum, i.e., the
oscillation frequency of external field is the value of plasma frequency.
