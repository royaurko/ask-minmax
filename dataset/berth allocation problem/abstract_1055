In Network on Chip (NoC) rooted system, energy consumption is affected by
task scheduling and allocation schemes which affect the performance of the
system. In this paper we test the pre-existing proposed algorithms and
introduced a new energy skilled algorithm for 3D NoC architecture. An efficient
dynamic and cluster approaches are proposed along with the optimization using
bio-inspired algorithm. The proposed algorithm has been implemented and
evaluated on randomly generated benchmark and real life application such as
MMS, Telecom and VOPD. The algorithm has also been tested with the E3S
benchmark and has been compared with the existing mapping algorithm spiral and
crinkle and has shown better reduction in the communication energy consumption
and shows improvement in the performance of the system. On performing
experimental analysis of proposed algorithm results shows that average
reduction in energy consumption is 49%, reduction in communication cost is 48%
and average latency is 34%. Cluster based approach is mapped onto NoC using
Dynamic Diagonal Mapping (DDMap), Crinkle and Spiral algorithms and found DDmap
provides improved result. On analysis and comparison of mapping of cluster
using DDmap approach the average energy reduction is 14% and 9% with crinkle
and spiral.
