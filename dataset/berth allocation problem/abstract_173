This paper studies the problem of mobile video delivery in heterogenous
wireless networks from a server to multihomed device. Most existing works only
consider delivering video streaming on single path which bandwidth is limited
causing ultimate video transmission rate. To solve this live video streaming
transmission bottleneck problem, we propose a novel solution named Joint Data
Allocation and Fountain Coding (JDAFC) method that contain below characters:
(1) path selection, (2) dynamic data allocation, and (3) fountain coding. We
evaluate the performance of JDAFC by simulation experiments using Exata and
JVSM and compare it with some reference solutions. Experimental results
represent that JDAFC outperforms the competing solutions in improving the video
peak signal-to-noise ratio as well as reducing the end-to-end delay.
