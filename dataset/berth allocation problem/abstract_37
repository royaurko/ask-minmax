Spectrum sharing is an elegant solution to addressing the scarcity of the
bandwidth for wireless communications systems. This research studies the
feasibility of sharing the spectrum between sectorized cellular systems and
stationary radars interfering with certain sectors of the communications
infrastructure. It also explores allocating optimal resources to mobile devices
in order to provide with the quality of service for all running applications
whilst growing the communications network spectrally coexistent with the radar
systems. The rate allocation problem is formulated as two convex optimizations,
where the radar-interfering sector assignments are extracted from the portion
of the spectrum non-overlapping with the radar operating frequency. Such a
double-stage resource allocation procedure inherits the fairness into the rate
allocation scheme by first assigning the spectrally radar-overlapping
resources.
