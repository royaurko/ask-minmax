In the near future FPGAs will be available by the hour, however this new
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) usage mode presents both an opportunity and
a challenge: The opportunity is that programmers can potentially trade
resources for performance on a much larger scale, for much shorter periods of
time than before. The challenge is in finding and traversing the trade-off for
heterogeneous IaaS that guarantees increased resources result in the greatest
possible increased performance. Such a trade-off is Pareto optimal. The Pareto
optimal trade-off for clusters of heterogeneous resources can be found by
solving multiple, multi-objective optimisation problems, resulting in an
optimal allocation of tasks to the available platforms. Solving these
optimisation programs can be done using simple heuristic approaches or formal
Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques. When pricing 128 financial
options using a Monte Carlo algorithm upon a heterogeneous cluster of Multicore
CPU, GPU and FPGA platforms, the MILP approach produces a trade-off that is up
to 110% faster than a heuristic approach, and over 50% cheaper. These results
suggest that high quality performance-resource trade-offs of heterogeneous IaaS
are best realised through a formal optimisation approach.
