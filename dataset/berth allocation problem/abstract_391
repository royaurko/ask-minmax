Internet search results are a growing and highly profitable advertising
platform. Search providers auction advertising slots to advertisers on their
search result pages. Due to the high volume of searches and the users' low
tolerance for search result latency, it is imperative to resolve these auctions
fast. Current approaches restrict the expressiveness of bids in order to
achieve fast winner determination, which is the problem of allocating slots to
advertisers so as to maximize the expected revenue given the advertisers' bids.
The goal of our work is to permit more expressive bidding, thus allowing
advertisers to achieve complex advertising goals, while still providing fast
and scalable techniques for winner determination.
