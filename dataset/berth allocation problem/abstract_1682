Using the dbar-problem and dual dbar-problem, we derive bilinear relations
which allows us to construct integrable hierarchies in different
parametrizations, their Darboux-B\"{a}cklund transformations and to analyze
constraints for them ina very simple way. Scalar KP, BKP and CKP hierarchies
are considered as examples.
