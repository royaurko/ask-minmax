As cloud computing services rapidly expand their customer base, it has become
important to share cloud resources, so as to provide them economically. In
cloud computing services, multiple types of resources, such as processing
ability, bandwidth and storage, need to be allocated simultaneously. If there
is a surge of requests, a competition will arise between these requests for the
use of cloud resources. This leads to the disruption of the service and it is
necessary to consider a measure to avoid or relieve congestion of cloud
computing environments.
  This paper proposes a new congestion control method for cloud computing
environments which reduces the size of required resource for congested resource
type instead of restricting all service requests as in the existing networks.
Next, this paper proposes the user service specifications for the proposed
congestion control method, and clarifies the algorithm to decide the optimal
size of required resource to be reduced, based on the load offered to the
system. It is demonstrated by simulation evaluations that the proposed method
can handle more requests compared with the conventional methods and relieve the
congestion. Then, this paper proposes to enhance the proposed method, so as to
enable the fair resource allocation among users in congested situation.
