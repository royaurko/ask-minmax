Patriksson (2008) provided a then up-to-date survey on the
continuous,separable, differentiable and convex resource allocation problem
with a single resource constraint. Since the publication of that paper the
interest in the problem has grown: several new applications have arisen where
the problem at hand constitutes a subproblem, and several new algorithms have
been developed for its efficient solution. This paper therefore serves three
purposes. First, it provides an up-to-date extension of the survey of the
literature of the field, complementing the survey in Patriksson (2008) with
more then 20 books and articles. Second, it contributes improvements of some of
these algorithms, in particular with an improvement of the pegging (that is,
variable fixing) process in the relaxation algorithm, and an improved means to
evaluate subsolutions. Third, it numerically evaluates several relaxation
(primal) and breakpoint (dual) algorithms, incorporating a variety of pegging
strategies, as well as a quasi-Newton method. Our conclusion is that our
modification of the relaxation algorithm performs the best. At least for
problem sizes up to 30 million variables the practical time complexity for the
breakpoint and relaxation algorithms is linear.
