This paper presents MoLUSC, a new method for generating mock galaxy catalogs
from a large scale ($\approx 1000^3$ Mpc$^3$) dark matter simulation, that
requires only modest CPU time and memory allocation. The method uses a
small-scale ($\approx 256^3$ Mpc$^3$) dark matter simulation on which the
\galics semi-analytic code has been run in order to define the transformation
from dark matter density to galaxy density transformation using a probabilistic
treatment. MoLUSC is then applied to a large-scale dark matter simulation in
order to produce a realistic distribution of galaxies and their associated
spectra. This permits the fast generation of large-scale mock surveys using
relatively low-resolution simulations. We describe various tests which have
been conducted to validate the method, and demonstrate a first application to
generate a mock Sloan Digital Sky Survey redshift survey.
