The paper considers a general model of electoral systems combining
district-based elections with a compensatory mechanism in order to create any
outcome between strictly majoritarian and purely proportional seat allocation.
It contains vote transfer and allows for the application of three different
correction formulas. Analysis in a two-party system shows that a trade-off
exists for the dominant party between its expected seat share and its chance of
obtaining majority. Vote transfer rules are also investigated by focusing on
the possibility of manipulation.
  The model is applied to the 2014 Hungarian parliamentary election.
Hypothetical results reveal that the vote transfer rule cannot be evaluated in
itself, only together with the share of constituency seats. With an appropriate
choice of the latter, the three mechanisms may be functionally equivalent.
