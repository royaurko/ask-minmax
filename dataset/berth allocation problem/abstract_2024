In this paper we provide a representation formula for boundary voltage
perturbations caused by internal conductivity inhomogeneities of low volume
fraction in a simplified {\em monodomain model} describing the electric
activity of the heart. We derive such a result in the case of a nonlinear
problem. Our long-term goal is the solution of the inverse problem related to
the detection of regions affected by heart ischemic disease, whose position and
size are unknown. We model the presence of ischemic regions in the form of
small inhomogeneities. This leads to the study of a boundary value problem for
a semilinear elliptic equation. We first analyze the well-posedness of the
problem establishing some key energy estimates. These allow us to derive
rigorously an asymptotic formula of the boundary potential perturbation due to
the presence of the inhomogeneities, following an approach similar to the one
introduced by Capdeboscq and Vogelius in \cite{capvoge} in the case of the
linear conductivity equation. Finally, we propose some ideas of the
reconstruction procedure that might be used to detect the inhomogeneities.
