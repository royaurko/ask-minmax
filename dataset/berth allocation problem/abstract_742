User mobility in wireless data networks is increasing because of
technological advances and the desire for voice and multimedia applications.
These applications, however, require fast handoffs between base stations to
maintain the quality of the connections. In this paper, the contributors describe
the use of novel and efficient data structure which dynamically allocates guard
channel for handoffs and introduces the concept of channel borrowing strategy.
The proposed scheme allocates the guard channels for handoff requests
dynamically, based on the traffic load for certain time period. A new
originating call in the cell coverage area also uses these guard channels if
they are unused. Our basic idea is to allow Guard channels to be shared between
new calls and handoff calls. This approach maximizes the channel utilization.
The simulation results prove that the channel borrowing scheme improves the
overall throughput.
