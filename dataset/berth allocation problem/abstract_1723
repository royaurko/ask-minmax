This application note describes how to model diffusion-limited crystal growth
from vapor using QuickField - a commercial finite-element analysis code. The
crystal growth problem is cast into the format of a steady-state heat diffusion
problem, which is one type of problem QuickField is designed to solve, and we
derive the relevant conversion factors and correspondences between variables.
We also describe three types of boundary conditions in the crystal growth
problem and their corresponding boundary conditions in the heat diffusion
problem. As an example, we examine the crystal growth of ice from water vapor
in a background gas using a variety of mixed boundary conditions.
