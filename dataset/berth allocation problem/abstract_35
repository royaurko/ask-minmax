In this report we construct two mechanisms that fully implement social
welfare maximising allocation in Nash equilibria for the case of a single
infinitely divisible good subject to multiple inequality constraints. The first
mechanism achieves weak budget balance, while the second is an extension of the
first, and achieves strong budget balance. One important application of this
mechanism is unicast service on the Internet where a network operator wishes to
allocate rates among strategic users in such a way that maximise overall user
satisfaction while respecting capacity constraints on every link in the
network. The emphasis of this work is on full implementation, which means that
all Nash equilibria of the induced game result in the optimal allocations of
the centralized allocation problem.
