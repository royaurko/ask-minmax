Temperature affects not only the reliability but also the performance, power,
and cost of the embedded system. This paper proposes a thermal-aware task
allocation and scheduling algorithm for embedded systems. The algorithm is used
as a sub-routine for hardware/software co-synthesis to reduce the peak
temperature and achieve a thermally even distribution while meeting real time
constraints. The paper investigates both power-aware and thermal-aware
approaches to task allocation and scheduling. The experimental results show
that the thermal-aware approach outperforms the power-aware schemes in terms of
maximal and average temperature reductions. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first task allocation and scheduling algorithm that takes temperature
into consideration.
