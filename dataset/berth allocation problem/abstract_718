Distributed clusters like the Grid and PlanetLab enable the same statistical
multiplexing efficiency gains for computing as the Internet provides for
networking. One major challenge is allocating resources in an economically
efficient and low-latency way. A common solution is proportional share, where
users each get resources in proportion to their pre-defined weight. However,
this does not allow users to differentiate the value of their jobs. This leads
to economic inefficiency. In contrast, systems that require reservations impose
a high latency (typically minutes to hours) to acquire resources.
  We present Tycoon, a market based distributed resource allocation system
based on proportional share. The key advantages of Tycoon are that it allows
users to differentiate the value of their jobs, its resource acquisition
latency is limited only by communication delays, and it imposes no manual
bidding overhead on users. We present experimental results using a prototype
implementation of our design.
