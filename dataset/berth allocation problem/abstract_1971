We study a particular kind of chaotic dynamics for the planar 3-centre
problem on small negative energy level sets. We know that chaotic motions
exist, if we make the assumption that one of the centres is far away from the
other two (see Bolotin and Negrini, J. Diff. Eq. 190 (2003), 539--558): this
result has been obtained by the use of the Poincar\'e-Melnikov theory. Here we
change the assumption on the third centre: we do not make any hypothesis on its
position, and we obtain a perturbation of the 2-centre problem by assuming its
intensity to be very small. Then, for a dense subset of possible positions of
the perturbing centre on the real plane, we prove the existence of uniformly
hyperbolic invariant sets of periodic and chaotic almost collision orbits by
the use of a general result of Bolotin and MacKay (see Cel. Mech. & Dyn. Astr.
77 (2000), 49--75). To apply it, we must preliminarily construct chains of
collision arcs in a proper way. We succeed in doing that by the classical
regularisation of the 2-centre problem and the use of the periodic orbits of
the regularised problem passing through the third centre.
