In the present work we investigate the Tricomi problem with integral gluing
condition for parabolic-hyperbolic equation with the Caputo fractional order
derivative. Using the method of energy integrals we prove the uniqueness of the
solution for considered problem. The existence will be proved using methods of
ordinary differential equations, Fredholm integral equations and solution will
be represented in an explicit form.
