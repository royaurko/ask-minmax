We study mechanisms for an allocation of goods among agents, where agents
have no incentive to lie about their true values (incentive compatible) and for
which no agent will seek to exchange outcomes with another (envy-free).
Mechanisms satisfying each requirement separately have been studied
extensively, but there are few results on mechanisms achieving both. We are
interested in those allocations for which there exist payments such that the
resulting mechanism is simultaneously incentive compatible and envy-free.
Cyclic monotonicity is a characterization of incentive compatible allocations,
local efficiency is a characterization for envy-free allocations. We combine
the above to give a characterization for allocations which are both incentive
compatible and envy free. We show that even for allocations that allow payments
leading to incentive compatible mechanisms, and other payments leading to envy
free mechanisms, there may not exist any payments for which the mechanism is
simultaneously incentive compatible and envy-free. The characterization that we
give lets us compute the set of Pareto-optimal mechanisms that trade off envy
freeness for incentive compatibility.
