We present an analytical model that enables throughput evaluation of
Opportunistic Spectrum Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OS-OFDMA)
networks. The core feature of the model, based on a discrete time Markov chain,
is the consideration of different channel and subchannel allocation strategies
under different Primary and Secondary user types, traffic and priority levels.
The analytical model also assesses the impact of different spectrum sensing
strategies on the throughput of OS-OFDMA network. The analysis applies to the
IEEE 802.22 standard, to evaluate the impact of two-stage spectrum sensing
strategy and varying temporal activity of wireless microphones on the IEEE
802.22 throughput. Our study suggests that OS-OFDMA with subchannel notching
and channel bonding could provide almost ten times higher throughput compared
with the design without those options, when the activity and density of
wireless microphones is very high. Furthermore, we confirm that OS-OFDMA
implementation without subchannel notching, used in the IEEE 802.22, is able to
support real-time and non-real-time quality of service classes, provided that
wireless microphones temporal activity is moderate (with approximately one
wireless microphone per 3,000 inhabitants with light urban population density
and short duty cycles). Finally, two-stage spectrum sensing option improves
OS-OFDMA throughput, provided that the length of spectrum sensing at every
stage is optimized using our model.
