We address issues on the origin of gravity and the cosmological constant
problem based on a recent understanding about the correspondence between
noncommutative field theory and gravity. We suggest that the cosmological
constant problem can be resolved in a natural way if gravity emerges from a
gauge theory in noncommutative spacetime. Especially, we elucidate why the
emergent gravity implies that vacuum energy does not gravitate but only
fluctuations around the vacuum generate gravity. That is, a flat spacetime
emerges from uniform condensation of energy, previously identified with the
cosmological constant.
