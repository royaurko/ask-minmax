Despite the fact that Solid State Disk (SSD) data storage media had offered a
revolutionary property storages community, but the unavailability of a
comprehensive allocation strategy in SSDs storage media, leads to consuming the
available space, random writing processes, time-consuming reading processes,
and system resources consumption. In order to overcome these challenges, an
efficient allocation algorithm is a desirable option. In this paper, we had
executed an intensive investigation on the SSD-based allocation algorithms that
had been proposed by the knowledge community. An explanatory comparison had
been made between these algorithms. We reviewed these algorithms in order to
building advanced knowledge armature that would help in inventing new
allocation algorithms for this type of storage media.
