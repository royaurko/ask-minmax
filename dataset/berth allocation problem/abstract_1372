We design a protocol for dynamic prioritization of data on shared routers
such as untethered 3G/4G devices. The mechanism prioritizes bandwidth in favor
of users with the highest value, and is incentive compatible, so that users can
simply report their true values for network access. A revenue pooling mechanism
also aligns incentives for sellers, so that they will choose to use
prioritization methods that retain the incentive properties on the buy-side. In
this way, the design allows for an open architecture. In addition to revenue
pooling, the technical contribution is to identify a class of stochastic demand
models and a prioritization scheme that provides allocation monotonicity.
Simulation results confirm efficiency gains from dynamic prioritization
relative to prior methods, as well as the effectiveness of revenue pooling.
