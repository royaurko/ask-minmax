We study a distributed allocation process where, repeatedly in time, every
player renegotiates past allocations with neighbors and allocates new revenues.
The average allocations evolve according to a doubly (over time and space)
averaging algorithm. We study conditions under which the average allocations
reach consensus to any point within a predefined target set even in the
presence of adversarial disturbances. Motivations arise in the context of
coalitional games with transferable utilities (TU) where the target set is any
set of allocations that make the grand coalitions stable.
