We study a lossy source coding problem with secrecy constraints in which a
remote information source should be transmitted to a single destination via
multiple agents in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. The agents observe
noisy versions of the source and independently encode and transmit their
observations to the destination via noiseless rate-limited links. The
destination should estimate the remote source based on the information received
from the agents within a certain mean distortion threshold. The eavesdropper,
with access to side information correlated to the source, is able to listen in
on one of the links from the agents to the destination in order to obtain as
much information as possible about the source. This problem can be viewed as
the so-called CEO problem with additional secrecy constraints. We establish
inner and outer bounds on the rate-distortion-equivocation region of this
problem. We also obtain the region in special cases where the bounds are tight.
Furthermore, we study the quadratic Gaussian case and provide the optimal
rate-distortion-equivocation region when the eavesdropper has no side
information and an achievable region for a more general setup with side
information at the eavesdropper.
