In this paper, we consider a two-hop relay-assisted cognitive downlink OFDMA
system (named as secondary system) dynamically accessing a spectrum licensed to
a primary network, thereby improving the efficiency of spectrum usage. A
cluster-based relay-assisted architecture is proposed for the secondary system,
where relay stations are employed for minimizing the interference to the users
in the primary network and achieving fairness for cell-edge users. Based on
this architecture, an asymptotically optimal solution is derived for jointly
controlling data rates, transmission power, and subchannel allocation to
optimize the average weighted sum goodput where the proportional fair
scheduling (PFS) is included as a special case. This solution supports
decentralized implementation, requires small communication overhead, and is
robust against imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT)
and sensing measurement. The proposed solution achieves significant throughput
gains and better user-fairness compared with the existing designs. Finally, we
derived a simple and asymptotically optimal scheduling solution as well as the
associated closed-form performance under the proportional fair scheduling for a
large number of users. The system throughput is shown to be
$\mathcal{O}\left(N(1-q_p)(1-q_p^N)\ln\ln K_c\right)$, where $K_c$ is the
number of users in one cluster, $N$ is the number of subchannels and $q_p$ is
the active probability of primary users.
