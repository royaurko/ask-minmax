The idea of this paper is an advanced game concept. This concept is expected
to model non-monetary bilateral cooperations between self-interested agents.
Such non-monetary cases are social cooperations like allocation of high level
jobs or sexual relationships among humans. In a barter double auction, there is
a big amount of agents. Every agent has a vector of parameters which specifies
his demand and a vector which specifies his offer. Two agents can achieve a
commitment through barter exchange. The subjective satisfaction level (a number
between 0% and 100%) of an agent is as high as small is the distance between
his demand and the accepted offer. This paper introduces some facets of this
complex game concept.
