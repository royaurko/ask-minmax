A mobile cloud computing system is composed of heterogeneous services and
resources to be allocated by the cloud service provider to mobile cloud users.
On one hand, some of these resources are substitutable (e.g., users can use
storage from different places) that they have similar functions to the users.
On the other hand, some resources are complementary that the user will need
them as a bundle (e.g., users need both wireless connection and storage for
online photo posting). In this paper, we first model the resource allocation
process of a mobile cloud computing system as an auction mechanism with premium
and discount factors. The premium and discount factors indicate complementary
and substitutable relations among cloud resources provided by the service
provider. Then, we analyze the individual rationality and incentive
compatibility (truthfulness) properties of the users in the proposed auction
mechanism. The optimal solutions of the resource allocation and cost charging
schemes in the auction mechanism is discussed afterwards.
