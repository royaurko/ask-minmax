The complexity of the graph isomorphism problem for trapezoid graphs has been
open over a decade. This paper shows that the problem is GI-complete. More
precisely, we show that the graph isomorphism problem is GI-complete for
comparability graphs of partially ordered sets with interval dimension 2 and
height 3. In contrast, the problem is known to be solvable in polynomial time
for comparability graphs of partially ordered sets with interval dimension at
most 2 and height at most 2.
