Automatic classification of scientific articles based on common
characteristics is an interesting problem with many applications in digital
library and information retrieval systems. Properly organized articles can be
useful for automatic generation of taxonomies in scientific writings, textual
summarization, efficient information retrieval etc. Generating article bundles
from a large number of input articles, based on the associated features of the
articles is tedious and computationally expensive task. In this report we
propose an automatic two-step approach for topic extraction and bundling of
related articles from a set of scientific articles in real-time. For topic
extraction, we make use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling
techniques and for bundling, we make use of hierarchical agglomerative
clustering techniques.
  We run experiments to validate our bundling semantics and compare it with
existing models in use. We make use of an online crowdsourcing marketplace
provided by Amazon called Amazon Mechanical Turk to carry out experiments. We
explain our experimental setup and empirical results in detail and show that
our method is advantageous over existing ones.
