The proposed humanistic approach mapped the human character and behavior into
a device to evade the bondages of implementation and surely succeed as we live.
Human societies are the complex and most organized networks, in which many
communities having different cultural livelihood. The formation of communities
within a society and the way of associations can be mapped to MANET. In this
work we have presented the principles of humanism for MANETs. The proposed
approach is not only robust and secure but it certainly meets the existing
challenges (such as name resolution, address allocation and authentication).
Its object oriented design defines a service in terms of Arts, Culture, and
Machine. An 'Art' is the smallest unit of work (defined as an interface), the
'Culture' is the integration and implementation of one or more Arts (defined as
a class) and finally the 'Machine' which is an instance of a Culture that
defines a running service. The grouping of all communicable Machines having the
same Culture forms a 'Community'. We have used the term 'Society' for a MANET
having one or more communities and modeled using the humanistic approach. The
proposed approach is compared with GloMoSim and the implementation of file
transfer service is presented using the said approach. Our approach is better
in terms of implementation of the basic services, security, reliability,
throughput, extensibility, scalability etc.
