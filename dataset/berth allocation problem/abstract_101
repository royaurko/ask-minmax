The problem of resource allocation in multiple-antenna wiretap channels is
investigated, wherein a malicious user tries to eavesdrop the communication
between two legitimate users. Both multiple input single output single-antenna
eavesdropper (MISO-SE) and multiple input multiple output multiple-antenna
eavesdropper (MIMO-ME) systems are considered. Unlike most papers dealing with
physical layer security, the focus of the resource allocation process here is
not to maximize the secrecy capacity, but rather to maximize the energy
efficiency of the system. Two fractional energy-efficient metrics are
introduced, namely the ratios between the system secrecy capacity and the
consumed power, and between the system secret-key rate and the consumed power.
Both performance metrics are measured in bit/Joule, and result in non-concave
fractional optimization problems, which are tackled by fractional programming
theory and sequential convex optimization. For both performance metrics, the
energy-efficient resource allocation is carried out considering both perfect as
well as statistical channel state information (CSI) as to the channel from the
legitimate transmitter to the eavesdropper.
