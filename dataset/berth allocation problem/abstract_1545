Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is the state-ofthe- art mobile computing
technology aims to alleviate resource poverty of mobile devices. Recently,
several approaches and techniques have been proposed to augment mobile devices
by leveraging cloud computing. However, long-WAN latency and trust are still
two major issues in MCC that hinder its vision. In this paper, we analyze MCC
and discuss its issues. We leverage Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to
propose an arbitrated multi-tier infrastructure model named SAMI for MCC. Our
architecture consists of three major layers, namely SOA, arbitrator, and
infrastructure. The main strength of this architecture is in its multi-tier
infrastructure layer which leverages infrastructures from three main sources of
Clouds, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), and MNOs' contributorized dealers. On top
of the infrastructure layer, an arbitrator layer is designed to classify
Services and allocate them the suitable resources based on several metrics such
as resource requirement, latency and security. Utilizing SAMI facilitate
development and deployment of service-based platform-neutral mobile
applications.
