In shared access shaping subscriber traffic based on token bucket by ISPs
wastes network resources when there are few active subscribers, because it
cannot allocate excess bandwidth in the long term. To address it, traffic
control schemes based on core-stateless fair queueing (CSFQ) and token bucket
meters (TBMs) have been proposed, which can allocate excess bandwidth among
active subscribers proportional to their token generation rates. Using FIFO
queue for all packets, however, degrades the short-term performance of
conformant traffic due to the presence of non-conformant packets already in the
queue. Also, the rate estimation based on exponential averaging makes it
difficult to react to rapid changes in traffic conditions. In this paper we
propose a new traffic control scheme based on deficit round-robin (DRR) and
TBMs to guarantee the quality of service of conformant packets in all time
scales while allocating excess bandwidth among active subscribers proportional
to their token generation rates, whose advantages over the CSFQ-based schemes
are demonstrated through simulation results.
