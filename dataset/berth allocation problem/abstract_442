Texts reveal the subjects of interest in research fields, and the values,
beliefs, and practices of researchers. In this study, texts are examined
through bibliometric mapping and topic modeling to provide a birds eye view of
the social dynamics associated with the diffusion of research synthesis methods
in the contexts of Social Work and Women's Studies. Research synthesis texts
are especially revealing because the methods, which include meta-analysis and
systematic review, are reliant on the availability of past research and data,
sometimes idealized as objective, egalitarian approaches to research
evaluation, fundamentally tied to past research practices, and performed with
the goal informing future research and practice. This study highlights the
co-influence of past and subsequent research within research fields;
illustrates dynamics of the diffusion process; and provides insight into the
cultural contexts of research in Social Work and Women's Studies. This study
suggests the potential to further develop bibliometric mapping and topic
modeling techniques to inform research problem selection and resource
allocation.
