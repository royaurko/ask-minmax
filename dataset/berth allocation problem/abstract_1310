Topic modeling based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) has been a
framework of choice to perform scene recognition and annotation. Recently, a
new type of topic model called the Document Neural Autoregressive Distribution
Estimator (DocNADE) was proposed and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance
for document modeling. In this work, we show how to successfully apply and
extend this model to the context of visual scene modeling. Specifically, we
propose SupDocNADE, a supervised extension of DocNADE, that increases the
discriminative power of the hidden topic features by incorporating label
information into the training objective of the model. We also describe how to
leverage information about the spatial position of the visual words and how to
embed additional image annotations, so as to simultaneously perform image
classification and annotation. We test our model on the Scene15, LabelMe and
UIUC-Sports datasets and show that it compares favorably to other topic models
such as the supervised variant of LDA.
