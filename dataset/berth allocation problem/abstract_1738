The co-word problem of a group G generated by a set X is defined as the set
of words in X which do not represent 1 in G. We introduce a new method to
decide if a permutation group has context-free co-word problem. We use this
method to show, that the Higman-Thompson groups, and therefore the Houghton
groups, have context-free co-word problem. We also give some examples of
groups, that even have an easier co-word problem. We call this property
semi-deterministic context-free. The second Houghton group belongs to this
class.
