We propose a simple probabilistic model of zapping behavior of television
viewers. Our model might be regarded as a `theoretical platform' to investigate
the human collective behavior in the macroscopic scale through the zapping
action of each viewer at the microscopic level. The stochastic process of
audience measurements as macroscopic quantities such as television program
rating point or the so-called gross rating point (GRP for short) are
reconstructed using the microscopic modeling of each viewer's decision making.
Assuming that each viewer decides the television station to watch by means of
three factors, namely, physical constraints on television controllers,
exogenous information such as advertisement of program by television station,
and endogenous information given by `word-of-mouth communication' through the
past market history, we shall construct an aggregation probability of
Gibbs-Boltzmann-type with the energy function. We discuss the possibility for
the ingredients of the model system to exhibit the collective behavior due to
not exogenous but endogenous information.
