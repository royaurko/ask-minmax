We study the expression complexity of two basic problems involving the
comparison of primitive positive formulas: equivalence and containment. In
particular, we study the complexity of these problems relative to finite
relational structures. We present two generic hardness results for the studied
problems, and discuss evidence that they are optimal and yield, for each of the
problems, a complexity trichotomy.
