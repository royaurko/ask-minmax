We develop stochastic variational inference, a scalable algorithm for
approximating posterior distributions. We develop this technique for a large
class of probabilistic models and we demonstrate it with two probabilistic
topic models, latent Dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical Dirichlet
process topic model. Using stochastic variational inference, we analyze several
large collections of documents: 300K articles from Nature, 1.8M articles from
The New York Times, and 3.8M articles from Wikipedia. Stochastic inference can
easily handle data sets of this size and outperforms traditional variational
inference, which can only handle a smaller subset. (We also show that the
Bayesian nonparametric topic model outperforms its parametric counterpart.)
Stochastic variational inference lets us apply complex Bayesian models to
massive data sets.
