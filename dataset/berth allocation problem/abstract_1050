Targeted therapies based on biomarker profiling are becoming a mainstream
direction of cancer research and treatment. Depending on the expression of
specific prognostic biomarkers, targeted therapies assign different cancer
drugs to subgroups of patients even if they are diagnosed with the same type of
cancer by traditional means, such as tumor location. For example, Herceptin is
only indicated for the subgroup of patients with HER2+ breast cancer, but not
other types of breast cancer. However, subgroups like HER2+ breast cancer with
effective targeted therapies are rare and most cancer drugs are still being
applied to large patient populations that include many patients who might not
respond or benefit. Also, the response to targeted agents in human is usually
unpredictable. To address these issues, we propose SUBA, subgroup-based
adaptive designs that simultaneously search for prognostic subgroups and
allocate patients adaptively to the best subgroup-specific treatments
throughout the course of the trial. The main features of SUBA include the
continuous reclassification of patient subgroups based on a random partition
model and the adaptive allocation of patients to the best treatment arm based
on posterior predictive probabilities. We compare the SUBA design with three
alternative designs including equal randomization, outcome-adaptive
randomization and a design based on a probit regression. In simulation studies
we find that SUBA compares favorably against the alternatives.
