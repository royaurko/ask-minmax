Inspired by a recent astro-ph posting, I propose a creation of an Alternative
History astro-ph archive (althistastro-ph). Such an archive would serve as a
final resting place for the various telescope (and possibly other) proposals
that were not successful. As we all know, from both submitting proposals and
also from serving on various time allocation committees, many excellent
proposals ``do not make it''. Creating such an AltHist archive would serve many
goals, including venting the frustration of the contributors and also providing
possible amusement for the readers. These are worthy goals, but they alone
would not warrant creating such an archive. The truly useful role of
AltHistAstro-ph archive would be to match astronomers with unappreciated ideas
with other astronomers with underutilized resources, hopefully leading in some
cases to resurrection of old proposals and resulting publications in the
regular astro-ph archive. Given the possible danger of a low signal-to-noise
and possible confusion, a creation of a separate archive seems like a good
idea, although it should be noted that low signal-to-noise is achieved on
astro-ph quite often already. Finally, I include my own excellent, but rejected
(twice), HST proposal, as an example of a potential AltHistAstro-ph posting.
