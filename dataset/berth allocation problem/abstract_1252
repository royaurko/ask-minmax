In this paper, we investigate the design of artificial-noise-aided secure
multi-antenna transmission in slow fading channels. The primary design concerns
include the transmit power allocation and the rate parameters of the wiretap
code. We consider two scenarios with different complexity levels: i) the design
parameters are chosen to be fixed for all transmissions, ii) they are
adaptively adjusted based on the instantaneous channel feedback from the
intended receiver. In both scenarios, we provide explicit design solutions for
achieving the maximal throughput subject to a secrecy constraint, given by a
maximum allowable secrecy outage probability. We then derive accurate
approximations for the maximal throughput in both scenarios in the high
signal-to-noise ratio region, and give new insights into the additional power
cost for achieving a higher security level, whilst maintaining a specified
target throughput. In the end, the throughput gain of adaptive transmission
over non-adaptive transmission is also quantified and analyzed.
