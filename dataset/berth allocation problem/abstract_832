Linear precoded discrete multitone modulation (LP-DMT) system has been
already proved advantageous with adaptive resource allocation algorithm in a
power line communication (PLC) context. In this paper, we investigate the bit
and energy allocation algorithm of an adaptive LP-DMT system taking into
account the channel coding scheme. A coded adaptive LP-DMT system is presented
in the PLC context with a loading algorithm which ccommodates the channel
coding gains in bit and energy calculations. The performance of a concatenated
channel coding scheme, consisting of an inner Wei's 4-dimensional 16-states
trellis code and an outer Reed-Solomon code, in combination with the roposed
algorithm is analyzed. Simulation results are presented for a fixed target bit
error rate in a multicarrier scenario under power spectral density constraint.
Using a multipath model of PLC channel, it is shown that the proposed coded
adaptive LP-DMT system performs better than classical coded discrete multitone.
