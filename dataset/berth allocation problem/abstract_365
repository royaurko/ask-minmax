The ongoing concern about systemic risk since the outburst of the global
financial crisis has highlighted the need for risk measures at the level of
sets of interconnected financial components, such as portfolios, institutions
or members of clearinghouses. The two main issues in systemic risk are the
computation of an overall reserve level and its allocation to the different
components of the system according to their importance. We develop here a
pragmatic approach to systemic risk measurement and allocation based on
multivariate shortfall risk measures, where acceptable allocations are first
computed and then aggregated so as to minimize costs. We emphasize the analysis
of the risk allocation and of its sensitivity as an indicator of the systemic
risk. Moreover, we provide efficient numerical schemes to assess the risk
allocation in high dimensions.
