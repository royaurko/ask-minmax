Conditions for the unique solvability of the Cauchy problem for a family of
scalar functional differential equations are obtained. These conditions are
sufficient for the solvability of the Cauchy problem for every equation from
the family and are necessary for the solvability of the Cauchy problem for all
equations from the family. In contrast to many known articles, we consider
equations with functional operators acting into the space of essentially
bounded functions.
