The distributed resampling algorithm with proportional allocation (RNA) is
key to implementing particle filtering applications on parallel computer
systems. We extend the original work by Bolic et al. by introducing an adaptive
RNA (ARNA) algorithm, improving RNA by dynamically adjusting the
particle-exchange ratio and randomizing the process ring topology. This
improves the runtime performance of ARNA by about 9% over RNA with 10% particle
exchange. ARNA also significantly improves the speed at which information is
shared between processing elements, leading to about 20-fold faster
convergence. The ARNA algorithm requires only a few modifications to the
original RNA, and is hence easy to implement.
