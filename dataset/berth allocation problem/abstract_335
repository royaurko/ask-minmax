Data center operators face a bewildering set of choices when considering how
to provision resources on machines with complex I/O subsystems. Modern I/O
subsystems often have a rich mix of fast, high performing, but expensive SSDs
sitting alongside with cheaper but relatively slower (for random accesses)
traditional hard disk drives. The data center operators need to determine how
to provision the I/O resources for specific workloads so as to abide by
existing Service Level Agreements (SLAs), while minimizing the total operating
cost (TOC) of running the workload, where the TOC includes the amortized
hardware costs and the run time energy costs. The focus of this paper is on
introducing this new problem of TOC-based storage allocation, cast in a
framework that is compatible with traditional DBMS query optimization and query
processing architecture. We also present a heuristic-based solution to this
problem, called DOT. We have implemented DOT in PostgreSQL, and experiments
using TPC-H and TPC-C demonstrate significant TOC reduction by DOT in various
settings.
