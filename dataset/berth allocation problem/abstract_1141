We present two interference alignment techniques such that an opportunistic
point-to-point multiple input multiple output (MIMO) link can reuse, without
generating any additional interference, the same frequency band of a similar
pre-existing primary link. In this scenario, we exploit the fact that under
power constraints, although each radio maximizes independently its rate by
water-filling on their channel transfer matrix singular values, frequently, not
all of them are used. Therefore, by aligning the interference of the
opportunistic radio it is possible to transmit at a significant rate while
insuring zero-interference on the pre-existing link. We propose a linear
pre-coder for a perfect interference alignment and a power allocation scheme
which maximizes the individual data rate of the secondary link. Our numerical
results show that significant data rates are achieved even for a reduced number
of antennas.
