An adaptive joint power allocation (JPA) and linear receiver design algorithm
using the minimum bit error rate (MBER) criterion for a cooperative
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) network is proposed. The system employs
multiple relays with Distributed Space-Time Coding (DSTC) schemes and an
Amplify-and-Forward (AF) strategy. It is designed according to a joint
constrained optimization algorithm to determine the MBER power allocation
parameters and the receive filter parameters for each transmitted symbol. The
simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm obtains performance
gains compared to the equal power allocation systems and the minimum mean
square error (MMSE) designs.
