We provide a probabilistic solution of a not necessarily Markovian control
problem with a state constraint by means of a Backward Stochastic Differential
Equation (BSDE). The novelty of our solution approach is that the BSDE
possesses a singular terminal condition. We prove that a solution of the BSDE
exists, thus partly generalizing existence results obtained by Popier in [7]
and [8]. We perform a verification and discuss special cases for which the
control problem has explicit solutions.
