Effective enforcement of laws and policies requires expending resources to
prevent and detect offenders, as well as appropriate punishment schemes to
deter violators. In particular, enforcement of privacy laws and policies in
modern organizations that hold large volumes of personal information (e.g.,
hospitals, banks, and Web services providers) relies heavily on internal audit
mechanisms. We study economic considerations in the design of these mechanisms,
focusing in particular on effective resource allocation and appropriate
punishment schemes. We present an audit game model that is a natural
generalization of a standard security game model for resource allocation with
an additional punishment parameter. Computing the Stackelberg equilibrium for
this game is challenging because it involves solving an optimization problem
with non-convex quadratic constraints. We present an additive FPTAS that
efficiently computes a solution that is arbitrarily close to the optimal
solution.
