Operating system is a bridge between system and user. An operating system
(OS) is a software program that manages the hardware and software resources of
a computer. The OS performs basic tasks, such as controlling and allocating
memory, prioritizing the processing of instructions, controlling input and
output devices, facilitating networking, and managing files. It is difficult to
present a complete as well as deep account of operating systems developed till
date. So, this paper tries to overview only a subset of the available operating
systems and its different categories. OS are being developed by a large number
of academic and commercial organizations for the last several decades. This
paper, therefore, concentrates on the different categories of OS with special
emphasis to those that had deep impact on the evolution process. The aim of
this paper is to provide a brief timely commentary on the different categories
important operating systems available today.
