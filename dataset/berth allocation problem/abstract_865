This paper presents a novel two-way decode-and-forward (DF) relay strategy
for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) relay networks. This DF
relay strategy employs multi-subcarrier joint channel coding to leverage
frequency selective fading, and thus can achieve a higher data rate than the
conventional per-subcarrier DF relay strategies. We further propose a
low-complexity, optimal power allocation strategy to maximize the data rate of
the proposed relay strategy. Simulation results suggest that our strategy
obtains a substantial gain over the per-subcarrier DF relay strategies, and
also outperforms the amplify-and-forward (AF) relay strategy in a wide
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) region.
