In this paper, resource allocation for multiple-input multiple-output
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) downlink networks with
large numbers of base station antennas is studied. Assuming perfect channel
state information at the transmitter, the resource allocation algorithm design
is modeled as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the
joint power consumption of the power amplifiers, antenna unit, and signal
processing circuit unit. Subsequently, by exploiting the law of large numbers
and dual decomposition, an efficient suboptimal iterative resource allocation
algorithm is proposed for maximization of the system capacity (bit/s). In
particular, closed-form power allocation and antenna allocation policies are
derived in each iteration. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed
iterative resource allocation algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal performance
in a small number of iterations and unveil a trade-off between system capacity
and the number of activated antennas: Activating all antennas may not be a good
solution for system capacity maximization when a system with a per antenna
power cost is considered.
