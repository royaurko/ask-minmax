Cloud computing is one of the rapidly improving technologies. It provides
scalable resources needed for the ap- plications hosted on it. As cloud-based
services become more dynamic, resource provisioning becomes more challenging.
The QoS constrained resource allocation problem is considered in this paper, in
which customers are willing to host their applications on the provider's cloud
with a given SLA requirements for performance such as throughput and response
time. Since, the data centers hosting the applications consume huge amounts of
energy and cause huge operational costs, solutions that reduce energy
consumption as well as operational costs are gaining importance. In this work,
we propose an energy efficient mechanism that allocates the cloud resources to
the applications without violating the given service level agreements(SLA)
using Ant colony framework.
