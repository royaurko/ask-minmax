A nonuniform Neumann boundary-value problem is considered for the Poisson
equation in a thin domain $\Omega_\varepsilon$ coinciding with two thin
rectangles connected through a joint of diameter ${\cal O}(\varepsilon)$. A
rigorous procedure is developed to construct the complete asymptotic expansion
for the solution as the small parameter $\varepsilon \to 0.$ Energetic and
uniform pointwise estimates for the difference between the solution of the
starting problem $(\varepsilon >0)$ and the solution of the corresponding limit
problem $(\varepsilon =0)$ are proved, from which the influence of the
geometric irregularity of the joint is observed.
