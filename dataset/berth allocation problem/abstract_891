Cloud computing is a newly emerging distributed system which is evolved from
Grid computing. Task scheduling is the core research of cloud computing which
studies how to allocate the tasks among the physical nodes, so that the tasks
can get a balanced allocation or each task's execution cost decreases to the
minimum, or the overall system performance is optimal. Unlike task scheduling
based on time or cost before, aiming at the special reliability requirements in
cloud computing, we propose a non-cooperative game model for reliability-based
task scheduling approach. This model takes the steady-state availability that
computing nodes provide as the target, takes the task slicing strategy of the
schedulers as the game strategy, then finds the Nash equilibrium solution. And
also, we design a task scheduling algorithm based on this model. The
experiments can be seen that our task scheduling algorithm is better than the
so-called balanced scheduling algorithm.
