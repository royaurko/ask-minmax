This letter studies a wireless-powered amplify-and-forward relaying system,
where an energy-constrained relay node assists the information transmission
from the source to the destination using the energy harvested from the source.
We propose a novel two-phase protocol for efficient energy transfer and
information relaying, in which the relay operates in full-duplex mode with
simultaneous energy harvesting and information transmission. Compared with the
existing protocols, the proposed design possesses two main advantages: i) it
ensures uninterrupted information transmission since no time switching or power
splitting is needed at the relay for energy harvesting; ii) it enables the
so-called self-energy recycling, i.e., part of the energy (loop energy) that is
used for information transmission by the relay can be harvested and reused in
addition to the dedicated energy sent by the source. Under the multiple-input
single-output (MISO) channel setup, the optimal power allocation and
beamforming design at the relay are derived. Numerical results show a
significant throughput gain achieved by our proposed design over the existing
time switching-based relay protocol.
