One of the actual problems in the field of numerical optimisation, as is well
known, is the problem of the search for the global extremum of a multivariate
function [1-9,13,14,17-21]. Various versions of the random search methods
[6,8,9] are considered to be the most reliable to solve the problem of global
optimisation. In this work we present the little-known methods of Halton and
LP-search, which has been proved as one of the best practical solutions of the
global optimisation problem.
