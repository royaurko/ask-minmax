In many realistic problems of allocating resources, economy efficiency must
be taken into consideration together with social equality, and price rigidities
are often made according to some economic and social needs. We study the
computational issues of dynamic mechanisms for selling multiple indivisible
items under price rigidities. We propose a polynomial algorithm that can be
used to find over-demanded sets of items, and then introduce a dynamic
mechanism with rationing to discover constrained Walrasian equilibria under
price rigidities in polynomial time. We also address the computation of
sellers' expected profits and items' expected prices, and discuss strategical
issues in the sense of expected profits.
