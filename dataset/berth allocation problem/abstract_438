Convergence constrained power allocation (CCPA) in single carrier multiuser
(MU) single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems with turbo equalization is
considered in this paper. In order to exploit full benefit of the iterative
receiver, its convergence properties need to be considered also at the
transmitter side. The proposed scheme can guarantee that the desired quality of
service (QoS) is achieved after sufficient amount of iterations. We propose two
different successive convex approximations for solving the non-convex power
minimization problem subject to user specific QoS constraints. The results of
extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis demonstrate that the
proposed CCPA scheme can achieve the design objective. Numerical results show
that the proposed schemes can achieve superior performance in terms of power
consumption as compared to linear receivers with and without precoding as well
as to the iterative receiver without precoding.
