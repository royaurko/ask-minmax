Wireless device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular network is
a promising concept to improve user experience and resource utilization. Unlike
traditional D2D communication where two mobile devices in the proximity
establish a direct local link bypassing the base station, in this work we focus
on relay-aided D2D communication. Relay-aided transmission could enhance the
performance of D2D communication when D2D user equipments (UEs) are far apart
from each other and/or the quality of D2D link is not good enough for direct
communication. Considering the uncertainties in wireless links, we model and
analyze the performance of a relay-aided D2D communication network, where the
relay nodes serve both the cellular and D2D users. In particular, we formulate
the radio resource allocation problem in a two-hop network to guarantee the
data rate of the UEs while protecting other receiving nodes from interference.
Utilizing time sharing strategy, we provide a centralized solution under
bounded channel uncertainty. With a view to reducing the computational burden
at relay nodes, we propose a distributed solution approach using stable
matching to allocate radio resources in an efficient and computationally
inexpensive way. Numerical results show that the performance of the proposed
method is close to the centralized optimal solution and there is a distance
margin beyond which relaying of D2D traffic improves network performance.
