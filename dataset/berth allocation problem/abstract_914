In this paper, a new Computation-Control Motion Estimation (CCME) method is
proposed which can perform Motion Estimation (ME) adaptively under different
computation or power budgets while keeping high coding performance. We first
propose a new class-based method to measure the Macroblock (MB) importance
where MBs are classified into different classes and their importance is
measured by combining their class information as well as their initial matching
cost information. Based on the new MB importance measure, a complete CCME
framework is then proposed to allocate computation for ME. The proposed method
performs ME in a one-pass flow. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method can allocate computation more accurately than previous methods
and thus has better performance under the same computation budget.
