We consider the problem of storing and retrieving information from synthetic
DNA media. The mathematical basis of the problem is the construction and design
of sequences that may be discriminated based on their collection of substrings
observed through a noisy channel. This problem of reconstructing sequences from
traces was first investigated in the noiseless setting under the name of
"Markov type" analysis. Here, we explain the connection between the
reconstruction problem and the problem of DNA synthesis and sequencing, and
introduce the notion of a DNA storage channel. We analyze the number of
sequence equivalence classes under the channel mapping and propose new
asymmetric coding techniques to combat the effects of synthesis and sequencing
noise. In our analysis, we make use of restricted de Bruijn graphs and Ehrhart
theory for rational polytopes.
