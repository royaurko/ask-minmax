Mechanism design for a social utility being the sum of agents' utilities
(SoU) is a well-studied problem. There are, however, a number of problems of
theoretical and practical interest where a designer may have a different
objective than maximization of the SoU. One motivation for this is the desire
for more equitable allocation of resources among agents. A second, more subtle,
motivation is the fact that a fairer allocation indirectly implies less
variation in taxes which can be desirable in a situation where (implicit)
individual agent budgetary constraints make payment of large taxes unrealistic.
In this paper we study a family of social utilities that provide fair
allocation (with SoU being subsumed as an extreme case) and derive conditions
under which Bayesian and Dominant strategy implementation is possible. Through
a numerical example it is shown that the proposed method can result in
significant gains both in allocation fairness and tax reduction.
