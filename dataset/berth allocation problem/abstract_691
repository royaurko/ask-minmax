In the first chapter of this report, we provide an overview on mobile and
wireless networks, with special focus on the IEEE 802.22 norm, which is a norm
dedicated to cognitive radio (CR). Chapter 2 goes into detail about CR and
Chapter 3 is devoted to the presentation of the concept of agents and in
particular the concept of multi-agent systems (MAS). Finally, Chapter 4
provides a state of the art on the use of artificial intelligence techniques,
particularly MAS for radio resource allocation and dynamic spectrum access in
the field of CR.
