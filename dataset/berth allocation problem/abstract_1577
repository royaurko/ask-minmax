Human society is a complex and most organized networks, in which many
communities have different cultural livelihood. The creation/formation of one
or more communities within a society and the way of associations can be mapped
to MANET. By involving human characteristics and behavior, surely it would pave
a new way, for further development. In this paper we have presented a new
approach called "HAMANET" which is not only robust and secure but it certainly
meets the challenges of MANET (such as name resolution, address allocation and
authentication). Our object oriented design defines a service in terms of Arts,
Culture, and Machine. The 'Art' is the smallest unit of work (defined as an
interface), the 'Culture' is the integration/assembling of one or more Arts
(defined as a class) and finally the 'Machine' which is an instance of a
Culture that defines a service. The grouping of the communicable Machines of
the same Culture forms a 'Community'. We have used the term 'Society' for MANET
consisting of one or more communities and modeled using humanistic approach. We
have compared our design with GloMoSim and proposed the implementation of file
transfer service using the said approach. Our approach gives better results in
terms of implementation of the basic services, security, reliability,
throughput, extensibility, scalability etc.
