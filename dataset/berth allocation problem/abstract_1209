Platform virtualization helps solving major grid computing challenges: share
resource with flexible, user-controlled and custom execution environments and
in the meanwhile, isolate failures and malicious code. Grid resource management
tools will evolve to embrace support for virtual resource.
  We present two open source projects that transparently supply virtual
execution environments. Tycoon has been developed at HP Labs to optimise
resource usage in creating an economy where users bid to access virtual
machines and compete for CPU cycles. SmartDomains provides a peer-to-peer layer
that automates virtual machines deployment using a description language and
deployment engine from HP Labs. These projects demonstrate both client-server
and peer-to-peer approaches to virtual resource management. The first case
makes extensive use of virtual machines features for dynamic resource
allocation. The second translates virtual machines capabilities into a
sophisticated language where resource management components can be plugged in
configurations and architectures defined at deployment time.
  We propose to share our experience at CERN openlab developing SmartDomains
and deploying Tycoon to give an illustrative introduction to emerging research
in virtual resource management.
