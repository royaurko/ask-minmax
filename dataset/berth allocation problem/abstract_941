Investigation of organic molecular films by a method Raman of a spectroscopy
is carried out. It is shown, that values of frequencies of lines in a spectrum
of the lattice oscillations of the molecular films are depressed in comparison
with values of frequencies of similar lines in a monocrystal. Intensity of
padding lines will increase in a spectrum of films. Allocation of an impurity
in a film of an organic mixed crystal nonuniform. Examinations are lead by the
example of a p-dibromobenzene and the mixed crystal a p-dichlorobenzene /
p-dibromobenzene.
