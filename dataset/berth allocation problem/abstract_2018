We present a new class solutions for the inverse problem in the calculus of
variations in arbitrary dimension n. We also provide a number of new theorems
concerning the inverse problem using exterior differential systems theory. Our
new techniques provide a significant advance in the understanding of the
inverse problem in arbitrary dimension. We show that when the eigenvalues of a
certain curvature tensor are distinct and with n-1 integrable
eigen-distributions, the corresponding differential equations are variational
only if the non-integrable eigenspace has a certain geometric property. The
resulting Lagrangians depend on n-1 functions each of 2 variables. We give some
non-trivial examples in dimension 3. We finish with a new classification scheme
for the inverse problem in arbitrary dimension.
