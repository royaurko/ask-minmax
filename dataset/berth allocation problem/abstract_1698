This paper studies the low-rank matrix completion problem from an information
theoretic perspective. The completion problem is rephrased as a communication
problem of an (uncoded) low-rank matrix source over an erasure channel. The
paper then uses achievability and converse arguments to present order-wise
optimal bounds for the completion problem.
