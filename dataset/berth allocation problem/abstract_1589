In this paper, we consider a wireless-powered cooperative communication
network consisting of one hybrid access-point (AP), one source, and one relay.
In contrast to conventional cooperative networks, the source and relay in the
considered network have no embedded energy supply. They need to rely on the
energy harvested from the signals broadcasted by the AP for their cooperative
information transmission. Based on this three-node reference model, we propose
a harvest-then-cooperate (HTC) protocol, in which the source and relay harvest
energy from the AP in the downlink and work cooperatively in the uplink for the
source's information transmission. Considering a delay-limited transmission
mode, the approximate closed-form expression for the average throughput of the
proposed protocol is derived over Rayleigh fading channels. Subsequently, this
analysis is extended to the multi-relay scenario, where the approximate
throughput of the HTC protocol with two popular relay selection schemes is
derived. The asymptotic analyses for the throughput performance of the
considered schemes at high signal-to-noise radio are also provided. All
theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations. The impacts of the
system parameters, such as time allocation, relay number, and relay position,
on the throughput performance are extensively investigated.
