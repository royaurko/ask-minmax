In this paper, we present a space-time-frequency joint block coding (STFBC)
scheme to exploit the essential space-time-frequency degrees of freedom of
multiuser MISO-MC-CDMA systems. Specifically, we use a series of orthogonal
random codes to spread the space time code over several sub-carriers to obtain
multi-diversity gains, while multiuser parallel transmission is applied over
the same sub-carriers by making use of multiple orthogonal code channels.
Furthermore, to improve the system performance, we put forward to linear
precoding to the predetermined orthogonal STFBC, including transmitting
directions selection and power allocation over these directions. We propose a
precoder design method by making use of channel statistical information in time
domain based on the Kronecker correlation model for the channels, so feedback
amount can be decreased largely in multi-carrier systems. In addition, we give
the performance analysis from the perspectives of diversity order and coding
gain, respectively. Moreover, through asymptotic analysis, we derive some
simple precoder design methods, while guaranteeing a good performance. Finally,
numerical results validate our theoretical claims.
