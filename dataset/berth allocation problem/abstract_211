We consider the problem of jamming attack in a multiple access channel with
training-based transmission. First, we derive upper and lower bounds on the
maximum achievable ergodic sum-rate which explicitly shows the impact of
jamming during both the training phase and the data transmission phase. Then,
from the jammer's design perspective, we analytically find the optimal jamming
energy allocation between the two phases that minimizes the derived bounds on
the ergodic sum-rate. Numerical results demonstrate that the obtained optimal
jamming design reduces the ergodic sum-rate of the legitimate users
considerably in comparison to fixed power jamming.
