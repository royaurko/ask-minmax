In this paper, a distributed and autonomous technique for resource and power
allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
femto-cellular networks is presented. Here, resource blocks (RBs) and their
corresponding transmit powers are assigned to the user(s) in each cell
individually without explicit coordination between femto base stations (FBSs).
The "allocatability" of each resource is determined utilising only locally
available information of the following quantities: - the required rate of the
user; - the quality (i.e., strength) of the desired signal; - the
frequency-selective fading on each RB; and - the level of interference incident
on each RB. Using a fuzzy logic system, the time-averaged values of each of
these inputs are combined to determine which RBs are most suitable to be
allocated in a particular cell, i.e., which resources can be allocated such
that the user requested rate(s) in that cell are satisfied. Furthermore, link
adaptation (LA) is included, enabling users to adjust to varying channel
conditions. A comprehensive study of this system in a femto-cell environment is
performed, yielding system performance improvements in terms of throughput,
energy efficiency and coverage over state-of-the-art ICIC techniques.
