A new evolutionary algorithm for scheduling and allocation algorithm is
developed for an elliptic filter. The elliptic filter is scheduled and
allocated in the proposed work which is then compared with the different
scheduling algorithms like As Soon As Possible algorithm, As Late As Possible
algorithm, Mobility Based Shift algorithm, FDLS, FDS and MOGS. In this paper
execution time and resource utilization is calculated using different
scheduling algorithm for an Elliptic Filter and reported that proposed
Scheduling and Allocation increases the speed of operation by reducing the
control step. The proposed work to analyse the magnitude, phase and noise
responses for different scheduling algorithm in an elliptic filter.
