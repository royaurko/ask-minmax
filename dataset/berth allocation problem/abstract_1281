In biology, the evolution of increasingly cooperative groups has shaped the
history of life. Genes collaborate in the control of cells; cells efficiently
divide tasks to produce cohesive multicellular individuals; individual members
of insect colonies cooperate in integrated societies. Biological cooperation
provides a foundation on which to understand human behavior. Conceptually, the
economics of efficient allocation and the game-like processes of strategy are
well understood in biology; we find the same essential processes in many
successful theories of human sociality. Historically, the trace of biological
evolution informs in two ways. First, the evolutionary transformations in
biological cooperation provide insight into how economic and strategic
processes play out over time--a source of analogy that, when applied
thoughtfully, aids analysis of human sociality. Second, humans arose from
biological history--a factual account of the past that tells us much about the
material basis of human behavior.
