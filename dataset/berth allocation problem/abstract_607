The importance of unsupervised clustering and topic modeling is well
recognized with ever-increasing volumes of text data. In this paper, we propose
a fast method for hierarchical clustering and topic modeling called HierNMF2.
Our method is based on fast Rank-2 nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) that
performs binary clustering and an efficient node splitting rule. Further
utilizing the final leaf nodes generated in HierNMF2 and the idea of
nonnegative least squares fitting, we propose a new clustering/topic modeling
method called FlatNMF2 that recovers a flat clustering/topic modeling result in
a very simple yet significantly more effective way than any other existing
methods. We describe highly optimized open source software in C++ for both
HierNMF2 and FlatNMF2 for hierarchical and partitional clustering/topic
modeling of document data sets.
  Substantial experimental tests are presented that illustrate significant
improvements both in computational time as well as quality of solutions. We
compare our methods to other clustering methods including K-means, standard
NMF, and CLUTO, and also topic modeling methods including latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA) and recently proposed algorithms for NMF with separability
constraints. Overall, we present efficient tools for analyzing large-scale data
sets, and techniques that can be generalized to many other data analytics
problem domains.
