It is well known that quantile regression model minimizes the portfolio
extreme risk, whenever the attention is placed on the estimation of the
response variable left quantiles. We show that, by considering the entire
conditional distribution of the dependent variable, it is possible to optimize
different risk and performance indicators. In particular, we introduce a
risk-adjusted profitability measure, useful in evaluating financial portfolios
under a pessimistic perspective, since the reward contribution is net of the
most favorable outcomes. Moreover, as we consider large portfolios, we also
cope with the dimensionality issue by introducing an l1-norm penalty on the
assets weights.
