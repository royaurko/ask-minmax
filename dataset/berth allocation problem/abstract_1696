We consider several algorithmic problems concerning geodesics in finitely
generated groups. We show that the three geodesic problems considered by
Miasnikov et al [arXiv:0807.1032] are polynomial-time reducible to each other.
We study two new geodesic problems which arise in a previous paper of the
contributors and Fusy [arXiv:0902.0202] .
