Satisfaction level of femtocell users' depends on the availability of
requested bandwidth. But the xDSL line that can be used for the backhauling of
femtocell traffic cannot always provide sufficient bandwidth due to the
inequality between the xDSL capacity and demanded bandwidth of home
applications like, IPTV, PC, WiFi, and others. A Service Level Agreement (SLA)
between xDSL and femtocell operator (mobile operator) to reserve some bandwidth
for the upcoming femtocell calls can increase the satisfaction level for
femtocell users. In this paper we propose a SLA negotiation procedure for
femtocell networks. The Bandwidth Broker controls the allocated bandwidth for
femtocell users. Then we propose the dynamically reserve bandwidth scheme to
increase the femtocell user's satisfaction level. Finally, we present our
simulation results to validate the proposed scheme.
