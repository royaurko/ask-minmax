The probabilistic serial (PS) rule is one of the most prominent randomized
rules for the assignment problem. It is well-known for its superior fairness
and welfare properties. However, PS is not immune to manipulative behaviour by
the agents. We initiate the study of the computational complexity of an agent
manipulating the PS rule. We show that computing an expected utility better
response is NP- hard. On the other hand, we present a polynomial-time algorithm
to compute a lexicographic best response. For the case of two agents, we show
that even an expected utility best response can be computed in polynomial time.
Our result for the case of two agents relies on an interesting connection with
sequential allocation of discrete objects.
