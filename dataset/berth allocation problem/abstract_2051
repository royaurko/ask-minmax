The Cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA) is developed for solving
single-objective problems and it cannot be used for solving multi-objective
problems. So the multi-objective cuckoo optimization algorithm based on data
envelopment analysis (DEA) is developed in this paper and it can gain the
efficient Pareto frontiers. This algorithm is presented by the CCR model of DEA
and the output-oriented approach of it. The selection criterion is higher
efficiency for next iteration of the proposed hybrid method. So the profit
function of the COA is replaced by the efficiency value that is obtained from
DEA. This algorithm is compared with other methods using some test problems.
The results shows using COA and DEA approach for solving multi-objective
problems increases the speed and the accuracy of the generated solutions.
