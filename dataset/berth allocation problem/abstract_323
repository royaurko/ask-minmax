We report a significant and persistent enhancement of the conductivity in
free-standing non intentionnaly doped InAs nanowires upon irradiation in ultra
high vacuum. Combining four-point probe transport measurements performed on
nanowires with different surface chemistries, field-effect based measurements
and numerical simulations of the electron density, the change of the
conductivity is found to be caused by the increase of the surface free carrier
concentration. Although an electron beam of a few keV, typically used for the
inspection and the processing of materials, propagates through the entire
nanowire cross-section, we demonstrate that the nanowire electrical properties
are predominantly affected by radiation-induced defects occuring at the
nanowire surface and not in the bulk.
