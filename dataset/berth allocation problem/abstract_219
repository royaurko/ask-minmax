This work considers the problem of finding analytical expressions for the
expected values of dis- tributed computing performance metrics when the
underlying communication network has a complex structure. Through active
probing tests a real distributed computing environment is analysed. From the
resulting network, ensembles of synthetic graphs with additional structure are
used in Monte Carlo simulations to both validate analytical expressions and
explore the performance metrics under different conditions. Computing paradigms
with different hierarchical structures in computing ser- vices are gauged,
fully decentralised (i.e., peer-to-peer) environments providing the best
performance. Moreover, it is found that by implementing more intelligent
computing services configurations (e.g., betweenness centrality based mappings)
and task allocations strategies, significant improvements in the parallel
efficiency can be achieved. We qualitatively reproduce results from previous
works and provide closed-form solutions for the expected performance metrics
linking topological, application structure and allocation parameters when job
dependencies and a complex network structure are considered.
