This chapter focuses on the use of Grid technologies to achieve utility
computing. An overview of how Grids can support utility computing is first
presented through the architecture of Utility Grids. Then, utility-based
resource allocation is described in detail at each level of the architecture.
Finally, some industrial solutions for utility computing are discussed.
