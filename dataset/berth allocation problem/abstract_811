RiemCirc is a C++ program which allocates points inside the unit circle for
numerical quadrature on the circle, aiming at homogeneous equidistant
distribution. The weights of the quadrature rule are computed by the area of
the tiles that surround these nodes. The shapes of the areas are polygonal,
defined by Voronoi tessellation.
