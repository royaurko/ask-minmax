This is a short note that explains a problem on polynomial maps over finite
fields for non-experts. The problem is: Do there exist odd polynomial
automorphisms over the finite fields with 4,8,16,32,64,... elements? The
explanation is very, very basic. Also, the background of the problem is given,
and why it is of such importance. This all with the idea that the problem
enters the world of discrete mathematics, and can be approached from completely
different angles than normally used by people working in Affine Algebraic
Geometry.
