Resource allocation for cloud services is a complex task due to the diversity
of the services and the dynamic workloads. One way to address this is by
overprovisioning which results in high cost due to the unutilized resources. A
much more economical approach, relying on the stochastic nature of the demand,
is to allocate just the right amount of resources and use additional more
expensive mechanisms in case of overflow situations where demand exceeds the
capacity. In this paper we study this approach and show both by comprehensive
analysis for independent normal distributed demands and simulation on synthetic
data that it is significantly better than currently deployed methods.
