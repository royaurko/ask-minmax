In this paper, we study the Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power
Transfer (SWIPT) in a Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) two-user Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) Interference Channel (IFC). We assume
that the transmitters are non-cooperative and have perfect knowledge of the
local Channel State Information (CSI). We show that the necessary condition for
the optimal transmission strategy at high SNR is for the energy transmitter to
transmit its signal by allocating its transmit power on a single subcarrier.
Accordingly, we propose a one-subcarrier selection method for the energy
transmitter and identify the achievable rate-energy region. In addition, we
further enlarge the achievable rate-energy region by enabling a basic form of
transmitter cooperation where messages are exchanged to inform the energy
transmitter about the subcarriers unutilized by the information transmitter.
