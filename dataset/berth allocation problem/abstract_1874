In this paper we consider the problem of finding a vector that can be written
as a nonnegative integer linear combination of given 0-1 vectors, the
generators, such that the l_1-distance between this vector and a given target
vector is minimized. We prove that this closest vector problem is NP-hard to
approximate within a O(d) additive error, where d is the dimension of the
ambient vector space. We show that the problem can be approximated within a
O(d^{3/2}) additive error in polynomial time, by rounding an optimal solution
of a natural LP relaxation for the problem. We also observe that in the
particular case where the target vector is integer and the generators form a
totally unimodular matrix, the problem can be solved in polynomial time.
  The closest vector problem arises in the elaboration of radiation therapy
plans. In this context, the target is a nonnegative integer matrix and the
generators are certain 0-1 matrices whose rows satisfy the consecutive ones
property. Here we mainly consider the version of the problem in which the set
of generators comprises all those matrices that have on each nonzero row a
number of ones that is at least a certain constant. This set of generators
encodes the so-called minimum separation constraint.
