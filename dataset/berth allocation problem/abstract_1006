This paper presents the foundations of a computer oriented approach for
preparing a list of random treatment assignments to be adopted in randomised
controlled trials. Software is presented which can be applied in the earliest
stage of clinical trials and bioequivalence assays. This allocation of patients
to treatment in clinical trials ensures exactly equal treatment numbers. The
investigation of the randomness properties of an assignment leads to the
concept of a 'strong randomised list'. The new approach introduced in this note
is based on thresholds and produces a strong randomised list of treatment
assignments.
