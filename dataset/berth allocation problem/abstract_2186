In a recent paper, it was shown that the problem of existence of a continuous
map $X \to Y$ extending a given map $A \to Y$ defined on a subspace $A
\subseteq X$ is undecidable, even for $Y$ an even-dimensional sphere. In the
present paper, we prove that the same problem for $Y$ an odd-dimensional sphere
is decidable. More generally, the same holds for any $d$-connected target space
$Y$ whose homotopy groups $\pi_k Y$ are finite for $k>2d$.
