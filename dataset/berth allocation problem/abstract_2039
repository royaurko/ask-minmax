In many inverse problems, model parameters cannot be precisely determined
from observational data. Bayesian inference provides a mechanism for capturing
the resulting parameter uncertainty, but typically at a high computational
cost. This work introduces a multiscale decomposition that exploits conditional
independence across scales, when present in certain classes of inverse
problems, to decouple Bayesian inference into two stages: (1) a computationally
tractable coarse-scale inference problem; and (2) a mapping of the
low-dimensional coarse-scale posterior distribution into the original
high-dimensional parameter space. This decomposition relies on a
characterization of the non-Gaussian joint distribution of coarse- and
fine-scale quantities via optimal transport maps. We demonstrate our approach
on a sequence of inverse problems arising in subsurface flow, using the
multiscale finite element method to discretize the steady state pressure
equation. We compare the multiscale strategy with full-dimensional Markov chain
Monte Carlo on a problem of moderate dimension (100 parameters) and then use it
to infer a conductivity field described by over 10,000 parameters.
