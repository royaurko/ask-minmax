Two-way relaying (TWR) reduces the spectral-efficiency loss caused in
conventional half-duplex relaying. TWR is possible when two nodes exchange data
simultaneously through a relay. In cellular systems, data exchange between base
station (BS) and users is usually not simultaneous e.g., a user (TUE) has
uplink data to transmit during multiple access (MAC) phase, but does not have
downlink data to receive during broadcast (BC) phase. This non-simultaneous
data exchange will reduce TWR to spectrally-inefficient conventional
half-duplex relaying. With infrastructure relays, where multiple users
communicate through a relay, a new transmission protocol is proposed to recover
the spectral loss. The BC phase following the MAC phase of TUE is now used by
the relay to transmit downlink data to another user (RUE). RUE will not be able
to cancel the back-propagating interference. A structured precoder is designed
at the multi-antenna relay to cancel this interference. With multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) nodes, the proposed precoder also triangulates the
compound MAC and BC phase MIMO channels. The channel triangulation reduces the
weighted sum-rate optimization to power allocation problem, which is then cast
as a geometric program. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the
proposed protocol over conventional solutions.
