The bandwidth adaptation is the technique that allows the flexibility in
bandwidth allocation for a call. Using the bandwidth adaptation technique, the
number of call admission in the system can be increased significantly. In this
paper we propose a priority based bandwidth adaptation scheme that can release
multi-level of bandwidth from the existing calls to accept call requests. The
amount of released bandwidth is based on the number of existing bandwidth
adaptive calls and the priority of requesting traffic call. This priority
scheme does not reduce the bandwidth utilization. Moreover, the proposed
bandwidth adaptation strategy provides significantly reduced call blocking
probability for the higher priority traffic calls. The performance analyses
show the improvement of the proposed scheme.
