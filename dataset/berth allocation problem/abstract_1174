Grid computing is the next logical step to distributed computing. Main
objective of grid computing is an innovative approach to share resources such
as CPU usage; memory sharing and software sharing. Data Grids provide
transparent access to semantically related data resources in a heterogeneous
system. The system incorporates both data mining and grid computing techniques
where Grid application reduces the time for sending results to several clients
at the same time and Data mining application on computational grids gives fast
and sophisticated results to users. In this work, grid based data mining
technique is used to do automatic allocation based on probabilistic mining
frequent sequence algorithm. It finds frequent sequences for many users at a
time with accurate result. It also includes the trust management architecture
for trust enhanced security.
