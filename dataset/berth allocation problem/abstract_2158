We derived state probability equations describing the queue M(t)|M[k, B]|1
and formulated as an abstract Cauchy problem to investigate by means of the
semi-group theory of bounded linear operators in functional analysis. For the
abstract Cauchy problem of this queue, we determined the eigenfunctions of
maximal operator and showed some properties of the Dirichlet operator.
