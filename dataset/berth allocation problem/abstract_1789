The Minimum Fill-in problem is to decide if a graph can be triangulated by
adding at most k edges. Kaplan, Shamir, and Tarjan [FOCS 1994] have shown that
the problem is solvable in time O(2^(O(k)) + k2 * nm) on graphs with n vertices
and m edges and thus is fixed parameter tractable. Here, we give the first
subexponential parameterized algorithm solving Minimum Fill-in in time
O(2^(O(\sqrt{k} log k)) + k2 * nm). This substantially lower the complexity of
the problem. Techniques developed for Minimum Fill-in can be used to obtain
subexponential parameterized algorithms for several related problems including
Minimum Chain Completion, Chordal Graph Sandwich, and Triangulating Colored
Graph.
