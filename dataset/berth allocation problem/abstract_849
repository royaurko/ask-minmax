The technique of cooperative communication has recently gained momentum in
the research community; this technique utilizes the notion of relay, as an
intermediate node between the source and the destination, to enhance the
overall system performance. In this paper we ex-plored the benefits of adaptive
cooperation, in which the relay adapts its relaying process in response to
channel conditions and data priorities. We are particularly interested in
applying this concept to the cell border situation, in which two mobile nodes
acting as destinations com-municate with base stations (sources) through a
relay. The adaptive cooperation is proposed here since the transmission channel
conditions (Packet Error Rate for example) and data priori-ties are not the
same for both mobiles. We show that using the adaptive resource allocation
technique in combination with the cross layer design techniques, we can achieve
Real-Time data constraints with no additional overhead.
