The definition of preferences assigned to individuals is a concept that
concerns many disciplines, from economics, with the search of an acceptable
outcome for an ensemble of individuals, to decision making an analysis of vote
systems. We are concerned in the phenomena of good selection and economic
fairness. In Arrow's theorem this situation is expressed as the impossibility
of aggregate preferences among individuals falling down into some unfairness
state. This situation was also analyzed in a previous model in a network of
individuals with a random allocation. Both analysis are based on static
preferences.
  In a real society the individuals are confronted to information exchange
which can modify the way that they think. Also, the preference formation of
each individual is influenced by this exchange. This consideration reveals why
the actual theory is not able to make an accurate analysis of the influence of
the individual, or cluster of individuals, in the fairness state. The aim of
this investigation is to consider the coupling of two systems, one for the
formation of preferences and a second where an allocation of goods is done in
an evolutionary environment.
