With the purpose of unifying a number of approaches to energy problems found
in the literature, we introduce generalized energy automata. These are finite
automata whose edges are labeled with energy functions that define how energy
levels evolve during transitions. Uncovering a close connection between energy
problems and reachability and B\"uchi acceptance for semiring-weighted
automata, we show that these generalized energy problems are decidable. We also
provide complexity results for important special cases.
