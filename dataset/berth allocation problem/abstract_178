Rate outage probability is an important performance metric to measure the
level of quality of service (QoS) in the 4th Generation (4G) broadband access
networks. Thus, in this paper, we calculate a closed form expression of the
rate outage probability for a given user in a down-link multi-hop OFDMA-based
system encountered as a result of links channel variations. The channel random
behavior on different subcarriers allocated to a given user is assumed to
follow independent non-identical Nakagami-m distributions. Besides the rate
outage probability formulas for single hop and multi-hop networks, we also
derive a novel closed form formulas for the moment generating function,
probability distribution function (pdf), and the cumulative distribution
function (cdf) of a product of independent non-identical Gamma distributed
random variables (RVs). These RVs are functions of the attainable
signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) on the allocated group of subcarriers. For
single-hop scenario, inspired by the rate outage probability closed formula, we
formulate an optimization problem in which we allocate subcarriers to users
such that the total transmission rate is maximized while catering for fairness
for all users. In the proposed formulation, fairness is considered by
guaranteeing a minimum rate outage probability for each admitted user
