Much of human knowledge sits in large databases of unstructured text.
Leveraging this knowledge requires algorithms that extract and record metadata
on unstructured text documents. Assigning topics to documents will enable
intelligent search, statistical characterization, and meaningful
classification. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is the state-of-the-art in
topic classification. Here, we perform a systematic theoretical and numerical
analysis that demonstrates that current optimization techniques for LDA often
yield results which are not accurate in inferring the most suitable model
parameters. Adapting approaches for community detection in networks, we propose
a new algorithm which displays high-reproducibility and high-accuracy, and also
has high computational efficiency. We apply it to a large set of documents in
the English Wikipedia and reveal its hierarchical structure. Our algorithm
promises to make "big data" text analysis systems more reliable.
