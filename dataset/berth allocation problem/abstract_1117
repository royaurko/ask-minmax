We consider a class of games that are generalizations of the minority game,
in that the demand and supply of the resource are specified independently. This
allows us to study systems in which agents compete for a resource under
different demand loads. Among other features, we find, using numerical
simulations the existence of a robust phase change with a coexistence region as
the demand load is varied, separating regions with nearly balanced supply and
demand from regions of scarce or abundant resources. The coexistence region
exists when the amount of information used by the agents to make their choices
is greater than a critical value, which is related to the point at which there
is a phase transition in the standard minority game.
