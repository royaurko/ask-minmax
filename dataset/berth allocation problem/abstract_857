A key challenge in \cacd\ is determining how to allocate limited server
bandwidth across a large number of files being concurrently served so as to
optimize global performance and cost objectives. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of strategies to control server bandwidth
allocation. As part of this effort, we introduce a new {\em model-based}
control approach that relies on an accurate yet concise "cheat sheet" based on
a priori offline measurement to predict swarm performance as a function of the
server bandwidth and other swarm parameters. Our evaluation using a prototype
system, \cs, instantiating static, dynamic, and model-based controllers shows
that static and dynamic controllers can both be suboptimal due to different
reasons. In comparison, a model-based approach consistently outperforms both
static and dynamic approaches provided it has access to detailed measurements
in the regime of interest. Nevertheless, the broad applicability of a
model-based approach may be limited in practice because of the overhead of
developing and maintaining a comprehensive measurement-based model of swarm
performance in each regime of interest.
