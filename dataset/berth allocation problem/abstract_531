We present an online approach to portfolio selection. The motivation is
within the context of algorithmic trading, which demands fast and recursive
updates of portfolio allocations, as new data arrives. In particular, we look
at two online algorithms: Robust-Exponentially Weighted Least Squares (R-EWRLS)
and a regularized Online minimum Variance algorithm (O-VAR). Our methods use
simple ideas from signal processing and statistics, which are sometimes
overlooked in the empirical financial literature. The two approaches are
evaluated against benchmark allocation techniques using 4 real datasets. Our
methods outperform the benchmark allocation techniques in these datasets, in
terms of both computational demand and financial performance.
