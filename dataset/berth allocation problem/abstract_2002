We verify functional a posteriori error estimate proposed by S. Repin for a
class of obstacle problems. The obstacle problem is formulated as a quadratic
minimization problem with constrains equivalently formulated as a variational
inequality. New benchmarks with known analytical solutions in 2D are
constructed based on 1D benchmark introduced by P. Harasim and J. Valdman.
Numerical approximation of the obstacle problem is obtained by the finite
element method using bilinear elements on a rectangular mesh. Error of the
approximation is meassured in the energy norm and bounded from above by a
functional majorant, whose value is minimized with respect to unknown gradient
field discretized by Raviart-Thomas elements and Lagrange multipliers field
discretized by piecewise constant functions.
