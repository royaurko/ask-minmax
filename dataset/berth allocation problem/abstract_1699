We consider the classical problem of estimating norm of the derivative of
algebraic polynomial via the norm of polynomial itself. The corresponding
extremal problem for general polynomials in uniform norm was solved by V.
Markov. In this note we solve analogous problem for monotone polynomials. As a
consequence, we find exact constant in Bernstein inequality for monotone
polynomials.
