For finitely generated nilpotent groups, we employ Mal'cev coordinates to
solve several classical algorithmic problems efficiently. Computation of normal
forms, the membership problem, the conjugacy problem, and computation of
presentations for subgroups are solved using only logarithmic space and
quasilinear time. Logarithmic space presentation-uniform versions of these
algorithms are provided. Compressed-word versions of the same problems, in
which each input word is provided as a straight-line program, are solved in
polynomial time.
