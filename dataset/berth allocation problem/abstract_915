In this paper we study multi robot cooperative task allocation issue in a
situation where a swarm of robots is deployed in a confi?ned unknown
environment where the number of colored spots which represent tasks and the
ratios of them are unknown. The robots should cover this spots as far as
possible to do cleaning and sampling actions desirably. It means that they
should discover the spots cooperatively and spread proportional to the spots
area and avoid from remaining idle. We proposed 4 self-organized distributed
methods which are called hybrid methods for coping with this scenario. In two
diffe?rent experiments the performance of the methods is analyzed. We compared
them with each other and investigated their scalability and robustness in term
of single point of failure.
