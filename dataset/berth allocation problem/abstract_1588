We consider the capacitated selfish replication game with binary preferences.
We first devise an algorithm which can reach a pure Nash equilibrium on trees
after n steps where n is the number of nodes (players) in the game. Introducing
an ordinal potential function for such a game, we determine the convergence
rate of the best response dynamics to a pure Nash equilibrium based on the
radii of the updating agents. Using this potential function, we propose a least
best response dynamics. We prove polynomial time convergence of such dynamics
to a pure Nash equilibrium for general graphs when the number of resources is
limited or their edge density is high enough with respect to the number of
resources. This partially answers a conjecture on the existence of PLS-hard
algorithms for finding the equilibrium when the number of resources is more
than 2. We show that the least best response dynamics improve the convergence
speed of an earlier algorithm [1] in the case of two resources by a factor of
at least n^2. We extend the results for the capacitated selfish replication
games with arbitrary cache size and provide an effective allocation rule for
extra capacities in the network in order to accelerate the least best response
dynamics to an equilibrium in polynomial time. Finally, we make a comparison
between graph coloring and the set of equilibria of the capacitated selfish
replication game.
