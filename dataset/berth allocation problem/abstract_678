A hypothesis testing scheme for entanglement has been formulated based on the
Poisson distribution framework instead of the POVM framework. Three designs
were proposed to test the entangled states in this framework. The designs were
evaluated in terms of the asymptotic variance. It has been shown that the
optimal time allocation between the coincidence and anti-coincidence
measurement bases improves the conventional testing method. The test can be
further improved by optimizing the time allocation between the anti-coincidence
bases.
