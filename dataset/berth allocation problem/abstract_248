FOAM-2.06 is an upgraded version of FOAM, a general purpose, self-adapting
Monte Carlo event generator. In comparison with FOAM-2.05, it has two important
improvements. New interface to random numbers lets the user to choose from the
three "state of the art" random number generators. Improved algorithms for
simplical grid need less computer memory; the problem of the prohibitively
large memory allocation required for the large number ($>10^6$) of simplical
cells is now eliminated -- the new version can handle such cases even on the
average desktop computers. In addition, generation of the Monte Carlo events,
in case of large number of cells, may be even significantly faster.
