The allocation of a large amount of bandwidth by regulating bodies in the
70/80 GHz band, i.e., the E-band, has opened up new potentials and challenges
for providing affordable and reliable Gigabit per second wireless
point-to-point links. This article first reviews the available bandwidth and
licensing regulations in the E-band. Subsequently, different propagation
models, e.g., the ITU-R and Cane models, are compared against measurement
results and it is concluded that to meet specific availability requirements,
E-band wireless systems may need to be designed with larger fade margins
compared to microwave systems. A similar comparison is carried out between
measurements and models for oscillator phase noise. It is confirmed that phase
noise characteristics, that are neglected by the models used for narrowband
systems, need to be taken into account for the wideband systems deployed in the
E-band. Next, a new multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transceiver design, termed
continuous aperture phased (CAP)-MIMO, is presented. Simulations show that
CAP-MIMO enables E-band systems to achieve fiber-optic like throughputs.
Finally, it is argued that full-duplex relaying can be used to greatly enhance
the coverage of E-band systems without sacrificing throughput, thus,
facilitating their application in establishing the backhaul of heterogeneous
networks.
