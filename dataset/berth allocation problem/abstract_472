We consider the uplink of a cellular massive MIMO network. Since the spectral
efficiency of these networks is limited by pilot contamination, the pilot
allocation across cells is of paramount importance. However, finding efficient
pilot reuse patterns is non-trivial especially in practical asymmetric base
station deployments. In this paper, we approach this problem using coalitional
game theory. Each cell has its own unique pilots and can form coalitions with
other cells to gain access to more pilots. We develop a low-complexity
distributed algorithm and prove convergence to an individually stable coalition
structure. Simulations reveal fast algorithmic convergence and substantial
performance gains over one-cell coalitions and full pilot reuse.
