We revisit the classic problem of fair division from a mechanism design
perspective, using {\em Proportional Fairness} as a benchmark. In particular,
we aim to allocate a collection of divisible items to a set of agents while
incentivizing the agents to be truthful in reporting their valuations. For the
very large class of homogeneous valuations, we design a truthful mechanism that
provides {\em every agent} with at least a $1/e\approx 0.368$ fraction of her
Proportionally Fair valuation. To complement this result, we show that no
truthful mechanism can guarantee more than a $0.5$ fraction, even for the
restricted class of additive linear valuations. We also propose another
mechanism for additive linear valuations that works really well when every item
is highly demanded. To guarantee truthfulness, our mechanisms discard a
carefully chosen fraction of the allocated resources; we conclude by uncovering
interesting connections between our mechanisms and known mechanisms that use
money instead.
