In asserting a competitive market environment as a justification for
regulatory forbearance, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 finally articulated
a clear standard for the FCC's public interest standard, one of the most
protean concepts in communications. This seeming clarity has not, however,
inhibited intense political conflict over the term. This paper examines public
and regulatory debate over the AOL Time Warner merger as an example of the way
in which the linkage between competitions and commons policy becomes relevant
to communications policy, particularly in relation to mass media, and discusses
interpretations of the public interest in the current FCC. The paper proposes
that the Telecom Act's goal of fostering economic competition among information
service providers, and the democratic ideal of nurturing public relationships
and behaviors can be linked. Competition policy that creates the opportunity
for untrammeled interactivity also provides a sine qua non to nurture the
social phenomenon of the commons. The linked concepts of competition and
commons could also provide useful ways to interpret the public interest in
policy arenas as spectrum allocation and intellectual property.
