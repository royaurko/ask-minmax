The aim of the Hermes project is the development of a computer simulation
based on evacuation assistant to support security services in case of emergency
in complex buildings and thus to improve safety at mass events. One goal of the
project is to build and to calibrate models for pedestrian dynamics
specifically designed for forecasting the emergency egress of large crowds
faster than real-time. In this contribution, we give an overview of the project
and its experimental results of unidirectional flow in a corridor. Trajectories
of all pedestrians are analyzed with different measurement methods. The data
will be used for model calibration.
