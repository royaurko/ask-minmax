Developing CPU scheduling algorithms and understanding their impact in
practice can be difficult and time consuming due to the need to modify and test
operating system kernel code and measure the resulting performance on a
consistent workload of real applications. As processor is the important
resource, CPU scheduling becomes very important in accomplishing the operating
system (OS) design goals. The intention should be allowed as many as possible
running processes at all time in order to make best use of CPU. This paper
presents a state diagram that depicts the comparative study of various
scheduling algorithms for a single CPU and shows which algorithm is best for
the particular situation. Using this representation, it becomes much easier to
understand what is going on inside the system and why a different set of
processes is a candidate for the allocation of the CPU at different time. The
objective of the study is to analyze the high efficient CPU scheduler on design
of the high quality scheduling algorithms which suits the scheduling goals. Key
