We introduce a new set of consistent measures of risks, in terms of the
semi-invariants of pdf's, such that the centered moments and the cumulants of
the portfolio distribution of returns that put more emphasis on the tail the
distributions. We derive generalized efficient frontiers, based on these novel
measures of risks and present the generalized CAPM, both in the cases of
homogeneous and heterogeneous markets. Then, using a family of modified Weibull
distributions, encompassing both sub-exponentials and super-exponentials, to
parameterize the marginal distributions of asset returns and their natural
multivariate generalizations, we offer exact formulas for the moments and
cumulants of the distribution of returns of a portfolio made of an arbitrary
composition of these assets. Using combinatorial and hypergeometric functions,
we are in particular able to extend previous results to the case where the
exponents of the Weibull distributions are different from asset to asset and in
the presence of dependence between assets. In this parameterization, we treat
in details the problem of risk minimization using the cumulants as measures of
risks for a portfolio made of two assets and compare the theoretical
predictions with direct empirical data. Our extended formulas enable us to
determine analytically the conditions under which it is possible to ``have your
cake and eat it too'', i.e., to construct a portfolio with both larger return
and smaller ``large risks''.
