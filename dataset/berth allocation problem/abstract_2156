Using the simple case of Blasius similarity solution, we illustrate a
recently developed general method that reduces a strongly nonlinear problem
into a weakly nonlinear analysis. The basic idea is to find a quasi-solution
$F_0$ that satisfies the nonlinear problem and boundary conditions to within
small errors. Then, by decomposing the true solution $F=F_0+E$, a weakly
nonlinear analysis of $E$, using contraction mapping theorem in a suitable
space of functions provides the existence of solution as well as bounds on the
error $E$. The quasi-solution construction relies on a combination of
exponential asymptotics and standard orthogonal polynomial representations in
finite domain.
