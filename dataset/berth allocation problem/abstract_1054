The specialty of desktop-as-a-service cloud computing is that user can access
their desktop and can execute applications in virtual desktops on remote
servers. Resource management and resource utilization are most significant in
the area of desktop-as-a-service, cloud computing; however, handling a large
amount of clients in the most efficient manner poses important challenges.
Especially deciding how many clients to handle on one server, and where to
execute the user applications at each time is important. This is because we
have to ensure maximum resource utilization along with user data
confidentiality, customer satisfaction, scalability, minimum Service level
agreement (SLA) violation etc. Assigning too many users to one server leads to
customer dissatisfaction, while assigning too little leads to higher
investments costs. So we have taken into consideration these two situations
also. We study different aspects to optimize the resource usage and customer
satisfaction. Here in this paper We proposed Intelligent Resource Allocation
(IRA) Technique which assures the above mentioned parameters like minimum SLA
violation. For this, priorities are assigned to user requests based on their
SLA Factors in order to maintain their confidentiality. The results of the
paper indicate that by applying IRA Technique to the already existing
overbooking mechanism will improve the performance of the system with
significant reduction in SLA violation.
