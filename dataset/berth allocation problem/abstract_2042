The degree-constrained subgraph problem asks for a subgraph of a given graph
such that the degree of each vertex is within some specified bounds. We study
the following reconfiguration variant of this problem: Given two solutions to a
degree-constrained subgraph instance, can we transform one solution into the
other by adding and removing individual edges, such that each intermediate
subgraph satisfies the degree constraints and contains at least a certain
minimum number of edges? This problem is a generalization of the matching
reconfiguration problem, which is known to be in P. We show that even in the
more general setting the reconfiguration problem is in P.
