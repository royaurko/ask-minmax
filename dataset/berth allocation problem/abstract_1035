Auctions in which agents' payoffs are random variables have received
increased attention in recent years. In particular, recent work in algorithmic
mechanism design has produced mechanisms employing internal randomization,
partly in response to limitations on deterministic mechanisms imposed by
computational complexity. For many of these mechanisms, which are often
referred to as truthful-in-expectation, incentive compatibility is contingent
on the assumption that agents are risk-neutral. These mechanisms have been
criticized on the grounds that this assumption is too strong, because "real"
agents are typically risk averse, and moreover their precise attitude towards
risk is typically unknown a-priori. In response, researchers in algorithmic
mechanism design have sought the design of universally-truthful mechanisms ---
mechanisms for which incentive-compatibility makes no assumptions regarding
agents' attitudes towards risk.
  We show that any truthful-in-expectation mechanism can be generically
transformed into a mechanism that is incentive compatible even when agents are
risk averse, without modifying the mechanism's allocation rule. The transformed
mechanism does not require reporting of agents' risk profiles. Equivalently,
our result can be stated as follows: Every (randomized) allocation rule that is
implementable in dominant strategies when players are risk neutral is also
implementable when players are endowed with an arbitrary and unknown concave
utility function for money.
