The MIS data is critical to an organization and should be protected from
misuse by wrong persons. Although The MIS data is typically meant for the
senior managers each MIS report may not be required by every manager. The
access to MIS data is determined by the role of an individual in the
organization and controlled by the MIS administrator accordingly. The access is
generally determined by the following parameters, (a) the type of user (such as
staff or manager etc.), (b) the type of data (whether general data or
managerial data), (c) level of access (read/ write/ admin access) and (d)
special access allocated by MIS admin. By combining all the above four
parameters, each individual user can be allocated exact specific rights
required to access the MIS.
