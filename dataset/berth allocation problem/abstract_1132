The size distribution of land plots is a result of land allocation processes
in the past. In the absence of regulation this is a Markov process leading an
equilibrium described by a probabilistic equation used commonly in the
insurance and financial mathematics. We support this claim by analyzing the
distribution of two plot types, garden and build-up areas, in the Czech Land
Registry pointing out the coincidence with the distribution of prime number
factors described by Dickman function in the first case.
