In future wireless networks, a significant number of users will be vehicular.
One promising solution to improve the capacity for these vehicular users is to
employ moving relays or car base stations. The system forms cell inside the
vehicle and then uses rooftop antenna for back-hauling to overcome the
vehicular penetration loss. In this paper, we develop a model for aggregate
interference distribution generated from moving/parked cars to indoor users in
order to study whether indoor femto-cells can coexist on the same spectrum with
vehicular communications. Since spectrum contributorization for vehicular
communications is open at moment, we consider two spectrum sharing scenarios
(i) communication from mounted antennas on the roof of the vehicles to the
infrastructure network utilizes same spectrum with indoor femto-cells (ii)
in-vehicle communication utilizes same spectrum with indoor femto-cells while
vehicular to infrastructure (V2I) communication is allocated at different
spectrum. Based on our findings we suggest that V2I and indoor femto-cells
should be allocated at different spectrum. The reason being that mounted
roof-top antennas facing the indoor cells generate unacceptable interference
levels. On the other hand, in-vehicle communication and indoor cells can share
the spectrum thanks to the vehicle body isolation and the lower transmit power
levels that can be used inside the vehicle.
