This paper formulates and studies a general continuous-time behavioral
portfolio selection model under Kahneman and Tversky's (cumulative) prospect
theory, featuring S-shaped utility (value) functions and probability
distortions. Unlike the conventional expected utility maximization model, such
a behavioral model could be easily mis-formulated (a.k.a. ill-posed) if its
different components do not coordinate well with each other. Certain classes of
an ill-posed model are identified. A systematic approach, which is
fundamentally different from the ones employed for the utility model, is
developed to solve a well-posed model, assuming a complete market and general
It\^o processes for asset prices. The optimal terminal wealth positions,
derived in fairly explicit forms, possess surprisingly simple structure
reminiscent of a gambling policy betting on a good state of the world while
accepting a fixed, known loss in case of a bad one. An example with a two-piece
CRRA utility is presented to illustrate the general results obtained, and is
solved completely for all admissible parameters. The effect of the behavioral
criterion on the risky allocations is finally discussed.
