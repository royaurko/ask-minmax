The periodic homogenization problem of integro-differential equations of the
alpha stable L{\'e}vy operators is studied in this paper. Thanking to the
symmetry of the L{\'e}vy density, we can use the method of the formal
asymptotic expansion, to connect the problem to the ergodic cell problem. A
rigorous proof is given by the perturbed test function's method.
