Through our four years experiments on students' Scrum based agile software
development (ASD) process, we have gained deep understanding into the human
factors of agile methodology. We designed an agile project management tool -
the HASE collaboration development platform to support more than 400 students
self-organized into 80 teams to practice ASD. In this thesis, Based on our
experiments, simulations and analysis, we contributed a series of solutions and
insights in this researches, including 1) a Goal Net based method to enhance
goal and requirement management for ASD process, 2) a novel Simple Multi-Agent
Real-Time (SMART) approach to enhance intelligent task allocation for ASD
process, 3) a Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) based method to enhance emotion and
morale management for ASD process, 4) the first large scale in-depth empirical
insights on human factors in ASD process which have not yet been well studied
by existing research, and 5) the first to identify ASD process as a
human-computation system that exploit human efforts to perform tasks that
computers are not good at solving. On the other hand, computers can assist
human decision making in the ASD process.
