We study the envy free pricing problem faced by a seller who wishes to
maximize revenue by setting prices for bundles of items. If there is an
unlimited supply of items and agents are single minded then we show that
finding the revenue maximizing envy free allocation/pricing can be solved in
polynomial time by reducing it to an instance of weighted independent set on a
perfect graph.
  We define an allocation/pricing as \textit{multi envy free} if no agent
wishes to replace her allocation with the union of the allocations of some set
of other agents and her price with the sum of their prices. We show that it is
\textit{coNP}-hard to decide if a given allocation/pricing is multi envy free.
We also show that revenue maximization multi envy free allocation/pricing is
\textit{APX} hard.
  Furthermore, we give efficient algorithms and hardness results for various
variants of the highway problem.
