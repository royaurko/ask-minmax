Secure communications can be impeded by eavesdroppers in conventional relay
systems. This paper proposes cooperative jamming strategies for two-hop relay
networks where the eavesdropper can wiretap the relay channels in both hops. In
these approaches, the normally inactive nodes in the relay network can be used
as cooperative jamming sources to confuse the eavesdropper. Linear precoding
schemes are investigated for two scenarios where single or multiple data
streams are transmitted via a decode-and-forward (DF) relay, under the
assumption that global channel state information (CSI) is available. For the
case of single data stream transmission, we derive closed-form jamming
beamformers and the corresponding optimal power allocation. Generalized
singular value decomposition (GSVD)-based secure relaying schemes are proposed
for the transmission of multiple data streams. The optimal power allocation is
found for the GSVD relaying scheme via geometric programming. Based on this
result, a GSVD-based cooperative jamming scheme is proposed that shows
significant improvement in terms of secrecy rate compared to the approach
without jamming. Furthermore, the case involving an eavesdropper with unknown
CSI is also investigated in this paper. Simulation results show that the
secrecy rate is dramatically increased when inactive nodes in the relay network
participate in cooperative jamming.
