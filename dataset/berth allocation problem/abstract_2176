In this paper, we present error estimates of integral deferred correction
(InDC) methods constructed with stiffly accurate implicit Runge-Kutta methods
when applied to stiff problems characterized by a small positive parameter
$\varepsilon$. In our error estimates, we expand the global error in powers of
$\varepsilon$ and show the coefficients are global errors of the InDC method
applied to a sequence of differential algebraic systems. A study of these
errors and of the remainder of the expansion yields sharp error bounds for the
stiff problem. Numerical results for the van der Pol equation are presented.
They confirm our theoretical prediction.
