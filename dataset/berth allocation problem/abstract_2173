This article aims to explain the Nested Benders algorithm for the solution of
large-scale stochastic programming problems in a way that is intelligible to
someone coming to it for the first time. In doing so it gives an explanation of
Benders decomposition and of its application to two-stage stochastic
programming problems (also known in this context as the L-shaped method), then
extends this to multi-stage problems as the Nested Benders algorithm. The
article is aimed at readers with some knowledge of linear and possibly
stochastic programming but aims to develop most concepts from simple principles
in an understandable way. The focus is on intuitive understanding rather than
rigorous proofs.
