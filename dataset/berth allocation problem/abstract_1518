We investigate the diversity order of decode-and-forward relay selection in
Nakagami-m fading, in cases where practical channel estimation techniques are
applied. In this respect, we introduce a unified model for the imperfect
channel estimates, where the effects of noise, time-varying channels, and
feedback delays are jointly considered. Based on this model, the correlation
between the actual and the estimated channel values, \rho, is expressed as a
function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), yielding closed-form expressions
for the overall outage probability as a function of \rho. The resulting
diversity order and power gain reveal a high dependence of the performance of
relay selection on the high SNR behavior of \rho, thus shedding light onto the
effect of channel estimation on the overall performance. It is shown that when
the channel estimates are not frequently updated in applications involving
time-varying channels, or when the amount of power allocated for channel
estimation is not sufficiently high, the diversity potential of relay selection
is severely degraded. In short, the main contribution of this paper lies in
answering the following question: How fast should \rho tend to one, as the SNR
tends to infinity, so that relay selection does not experience any diversity
loss?
