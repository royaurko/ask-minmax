Defect estimation and prediction are some of the main modulating factors for
the success of software projects in any software industry. Maturity and
competency of a project manager in efficient prediction and estimation of
resource capabilities are one of the strategic driving forces towards the
generation of high quality software. Currently, there are no estimation
techniques developed through empirical analysis to evaluate the decision
capability of a project manager towards resource allocation for effective
defect management. This paper brings out an empirical study carried out in a
product based software organization. Our deep investigation on several projects
throws light on the impact of decision capability of project manager towards
accomplishment of an aforementioned objective. The paper enables project
managers to gain further awareness towards the significance of predictive
positioning in resource allocation in order to develop high quality defect-free
software products. It also enhances the maturity level of the company and its
persistence in the competitive atmosphere.
