Attacks by drones (i.e., unmanned combat air vehicles) continue to generate
heated political and ethical debates. Here we examine instead the quantitative
nature of drone attacks, focusing on how their intensity and frequency compares
to other forms of human conflict. Instead of the power-law distribution found
recently for insurgent and terrorist attacks, the severity of attacks is more
akin to lognormal and exponential distributions, suggesting that the dynamics
underlying drone attacks lie beyond these other forms of human conflict.
Meanwhile the pattern in the timing of attacks is consistent with one side
having almost complete control. We show that these novel features can be
reproduced and understood using a generative mathematical model in which
resource allocation to the dominant side is regulated through a feedback loop.
