In this paper we study a parabolic version of the fractional obstacle
problem, proving almost optimal regularity for the solution. This problem is
motivated by an American option model proposed by Menton which introduces, into
the theory of option evaluation, discontinuous paths in the dynamics of the
stock's prices.
