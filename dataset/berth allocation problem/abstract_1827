This paper addresses the variational multiscale stabilization of standard
finite element methods for linear partial differential equations that exhibit
multiscale features. The stabilization is of Petrov-Galerkin type with a
standard finite element trial space and a problem-dependent test space based on
pre-computed fine-scale correctors. The exponential decay of these correctors
and their localisation to local cell problems is rigorously justified. The
stabilization eliminates scale-dependent pre-asymptotic effects as they appear
for standard finite element discretizations of highly oscillatory problems,
e.g., the poor $L^2$ approximation in homogenization problems or the pollution
effect in high-frequency acoustic scattering.
