We study auctions with additive valuations where agents have a limit on the
number of goods they may receive. We refer to such valuations as {\em
capacitated} and seek mechanisms that maximize social welfare and are
simultaneously incentive compatible, envy-free, individually rational, and have
no positive transfers. If capacities are infinite, then sequentially repeating
the 2nd price Vickrey auction meets these requirements. In 1983, Leonard showed
that for unit capacities, VCG with Clarke Pivot payments is also envy free. For
capacities that are all unit or all infinite, the mechanism produces a
Walrasian pricing (subject to capacity constraints). Here, we consider general
capacities. For homogeneous capacities (all capacities equal) we show that VCG
with Clarke Pivot payments is envy free (VCG with Clarke Pivot payments is
always incentive compatible, individually rational, and has no positive
transfers). Contrariwise, there is no incentive compatible Walrasian pricing.
For heterogeneous capacities, we show that there is no mechanism with all 4
properties, but at least in some cases, one can achieve both incentive
compatibility and envy freeness.
