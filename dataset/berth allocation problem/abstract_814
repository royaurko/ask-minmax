Cloud computing has become more popular in provision of computing resources
under virtual machine (VM) abstraction for high performance computing (HPC)
users to run their applications. A HPC cloud is such cloud computing
environment. One of challenges of energy efficient resource allocation for VMs
in HPC cloud is tradeoff between minimizing total energy consumption of
physical machines (PMs) and satisfying Quality of Service (e.g. performance).
On one hand, cloud providers want to maximize their profit by reducing the
power cost (e.g. using the smallest number of running PMs). On the other hand,
cloud customers (users) want highest performance for their applications. In
this paper, we focus on the scenario that scheduler does not know global
information about user jobs and user applications in the future. Users will
request shortterm resources at fixed start times and non interrupted durations.
We then propose a new allocation heuristic (named Energy-aware and Performance
per watt oriented Bestfit (EPOBF)) that uses metric of performance per watt to
choose which most energy-efficient PM for mapping each VM (e.g. maximum of MIPS
per Watt). Using information from Feitelson's Parallel Workload Archive to
model HPC jobs, we compare the proposed EPOBF to state of the art heuristics on
heterogeneous PMs (each PM has multicore CPU). Simulations show that the EPOBF
can reduce significant total energy consumption in comparison with state of the
art allocation heuristics.
