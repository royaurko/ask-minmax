WiMAX, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, is a developing
wireless communication scheme that can provide broadband access to large-scale
coverage. WiMAX belongs to the family of standards of IEEE-802.16. To satisfy
user demands and support a new set of real time services and applications, a
realistic and dynamic resource allocation algorithm is mandatory. One of the
most efficient algorithm is EDF (earliest deadline first). But the problem is
that when the difference between deadlines is large enough, then lower priority
queues have to starve. So in this paper, we present a heuristic earliest
deadline first (H-EDF) approach of the uplink scheduler of the WiMAX real time
system. This H-EDF presents a way for efficient allocation of the bandwidth for
uplink, so that bandwidth utilization is proper and appropriate fairness is
provided to the system. We use Opnet simulator for implementing the WiMAX
network, which uses this H-EDF scheduling algorithm. We will analysis the
performance of the H-EDF algorithm in consideration with throughput as well as
involvement of delay.
