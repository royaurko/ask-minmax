Systemic risk refers to the risk that the financial system is susceptible to
failures due to the characteristics of the system itself. The tremendous cost
of this type of risk requires the design and implementation of tools for the
efficient macroprudential regulation of financial institutions. The current
paper proposes a novel approach to measuring systemic risk.
  Key to our construction is a rigorous derivation of systemic risk measures
from the structure of the underlying system and the objectives of a financial
regulator. The suggested systemic risk measures express systemic risk in terms
of capital endowments of the financial firms. Their definition requires two
ingredients: first, a cash flow or value model that assigns to the capital
allocations of the entities in the system a relevant stochastic outcome. The
second ingredient is an acceptability criterion, i.e. a set of random variables
that identifies those outcomes that are acceptable from the point of view of a
regulatory contributority. Systemic risk is measured by the set of allocations of
additional capital that lead to acceptable outcomes. We explain the conceptual
framework and the definition of systemic risk measures, provide an algorithm
for their computation, and illustrate their application in numerical case
studies.
