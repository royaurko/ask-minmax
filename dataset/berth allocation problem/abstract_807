As Grid computing is becoming an inevitable future, managing, scheduling and
monitoring dynamic, heterogeneous resources will present new challenges.
Solutions will have to be agile and adaptive, support self-organization and
autonomous management, while maintaining optimal resource utilisation.
Presented in this paper are basic principles and architectural concepts for
efficient resource allocation in heterogeneous Grid environment.
