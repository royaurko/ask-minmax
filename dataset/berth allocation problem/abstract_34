This paper describes a new approach for allocating resources to video
streaming traffic. Assuming that the future channel state can be predicted for
a certain time, we minimize the fraction of the bandwidth consumed for smooth
streaming by jointly allocating wireless channel resources and play-out buffer
size. To formalize this idea, we introduce a new model to capture the dynamic
of a video streaming buffer and the allocated spectrum in an optimization
problem. The result is a Linear Program that allows to trade off buffer size
and allocated bandwidth. Based on this tractable model, our simulation results
show that anticipating poor channel states and pre-loading the buffer
accordingly allows to serve more users at perfect video quality.
