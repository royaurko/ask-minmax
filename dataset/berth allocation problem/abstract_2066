To understand their data better, astronomers need to use statistical tools
that are more advanced than traditional ``freshman lab'' statistics. As an
illustration, the problem of combining apparently incompatible measurements of
a quantity is presented from both the traditional, and a more sophisticated
Bayesian, perspective. Explicit formulas are given for both treatments. Results
are shown for the value of the Hubble Constant, and a 95% confidence interval
of 66 < H0 < 82 (km/s/Mpc) is obtained.
