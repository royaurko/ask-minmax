We discuss a multi-objective/goal programming model for the allocation of
inventory of graphical advertisements. The model considers two types of
campaigns: guaranteed delivery (GD), which are sold months in advance, and
non-guaranteed delivery (NGD), which are sold using real-time auctions. We
investigate various advertiser and publisher objectives such as (a) revenue
from the sale of impressions, clicks and conversions, (b) future revenue from
the sale of NGD inventory, and (c) "fairness" of allocation. While the first
two objectives are monetary, the third is not. This combination of demand types
and objectives leads to potentially many variations of our model, which we
delineate and evaluate. Our experimental results, which are based on
optimization runs using real data sets, demonstrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of the proposed model.
