In recent years, the economic policy of privatization, which is defined as
the transfer of property or responsibility from public sector to private
sector, is one of the global phenomenon that increases use of markets to
allocate resources. One important motivation for privatization is to help
develop factor and product markets, as well as security markets. Progress in
privatization is correlated with improvements in perceived political and
investment risk. Many emerging countries have gradually reduced their political
risks during the course of sustained privatization. In fact, most risk
resolution seems to take place as privatization proceeds to its later stage.
Alternative benefits of privatization are improved risk sharing and increased
liquidity and activity of the market. One of the main methods to develop
privatization is entering a new stock to the markets for arising competition.
However, attention to the capability of the markets to accept a new stock is
substantial. Without considering the above statement, it is possible to reduce
the market's efficiency. In other words, introduction of a new stock to the
market usually decreases the stage of development and activity and increases
the risk. Based on complexity theory, we quantify how the following factors:
stage of development, activity, risk and investment horizons play roles in the
privatization.
