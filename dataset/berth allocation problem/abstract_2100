The operator square root of the Laplacian $(-\lap)^{1/2}$ can be obtained
from the harmonic extension problem to the upper half space as the operator
that maps the Dirichlet boundary condition to the Neumann condition. In this
paper we obtain similar characterizations for general fractional powers of the
Laplacian and other integro-differential operators. From those
characterizations we derive some properties of these integro-differential
equations from purely local arguments in the extension problems.
