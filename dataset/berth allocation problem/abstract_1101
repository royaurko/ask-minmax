Motivated by sensor networks and other distributed settings, several models
for distributed learning are presented. The models differ from classical works
in statistical pattern recognition by allocating observations of an independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling process amongst members of a
network of simple learning agents. The agents are limited in their ability to
communicate to a central fusion center and thus, the amount of information
available for use in classification or regression is constrained. For several
basic communication models in both the binary classification and regression
frameworks, we question the existence of agent decision rules and fusion rules
that result in a universally consistent ensemble. The answers to this question
present new issues to consider with regard to universal consistency. Insofar as
these models present a useful picture of distributed scenarios, this paper
addresses the issue of whether or not the guarantees provided by Stone's
Theorem in centralized environments hold in distributed settings.
