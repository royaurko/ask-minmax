This paper presents an environment for solving Prolog problems which has been
implemented as a module for the virtual laboratory VILAB. During the problem
solving processes the learners get fast adaptive feedback. As a result
analysing the learner's actions the system suggests the use of suitable
auxiliary predicates which will also be checked for proper implementation. The
focus of the environment has been set on robustness and the integration in
VILAB.
