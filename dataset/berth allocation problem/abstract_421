This work studies the problem of secure connection in cooperative wireless
communication with two relay strategies, decode-and-forward (DF) and
randomize-and-forward (RF). The four-node scenario and cellular scenario are
considered. For the typical four-node (source, destination, relay, and
eavesdropper) scenario, we derive the optimal power allocation for the DF
strategy and find that the RF strategy is always better than the DF to enhance
secure connection. In cellular networks, we show that without relay, it is
difficult to establish secure connections from the base station to the cell
edge users. The effect of relay placement for the cell edge users is
demonstrated by simulation. For both scenarios, we find that the benefit of
relay transmission increases when path loss becomes severer.
