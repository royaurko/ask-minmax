Recently, West et al. claimed to derive a general quantitative model based on
fundamental principles for the allocation of metabolic energy between
maintenance of existing tissue and the production of new biomass, and in
addition claimed to derive a single, parameterless universal curve that
describes the growth of many species. They further claimed that their model of
the 3/4 exponent for the allometric scaling of metabolism provides a novel
version of the growth equations and use the goodness of fit of growth-curve
data to these equations as support of this interpretation. Here, we show that
the universal curve arises from general considerations that are independent of
the specific allometric model used and that the data do not distinguish between
the 3/4 or the 2/3 exponent for the metabolic rate mass scaling.
