This paper proposes an oblivious watermarking algorithm with blind detection
approach for high volume data hiding in image signals. We present a detection
reliable signal adaptive embedding scheme for multiple messages in selective
sub-bands of wavelet (DWT) coefficients using direct sequence spread spectrum
(DS-SS) modulation technique. Here the impact of volumetric distortion sources
is analyzed on the ability of analytical bounds in order to recover the
watermark messages. In this context, the joint source-channel coding scheme has
been employed to obtain the better control of the system robustness. This
structure prevents the desynchronisation between encoder and decoder due to
selective embedding. The experimental results obtained for Spread Spectrum (SS)
transformed domain watermarking demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
system. This algorithmic architecture utilizes the existing allocated bandwidth
in the data transmission channel in a more efficient manner.
