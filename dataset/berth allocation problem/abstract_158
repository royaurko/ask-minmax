We consider computational and implementation issues for the completion of
monomial sets to involution using different involutive divisions. Every of
these divisions produces its own completion procedure. For the polynomial case
it yields an involutive basis which is a special form of a Groebner basis,
generally redundant. We also compare our Mathematica implementation of Janet
division to an implementation in C.
