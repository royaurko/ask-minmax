We discuss the use of saddlepoint methods in the analysis of portfolios, with
particular reference to credit portfolios. The objective is to proceed from a
model of the loss distribution, given through probabilities, correlations and
the like, to an analytical approximation of the distribution. Once this is done
we show how to derive the so-called risk contributions which are the
derivatives of risk measures, such as a given quantile (VaR) or expected
shortfall, to the allocations in the underlying assets. These show, informally,
where the risk is coming from, and also indicate how to go about optimising the
portfolio.
