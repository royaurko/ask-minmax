A binary linear error correcting codes represented by two code families
Kronecker products sum are considered. The dimension and distance of new code
is investigated. Upper and lower bounds of distance are obtained. Some examples
are given. It is shown that some classic constructions are the private cases of
considered one. The subclass of codes with equal lower and upper distance
bounds is allocated.
