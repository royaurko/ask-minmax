Cloud Data centers aim to provide reliable, sustainable and scalable services
for all kinds of applications. Resource scheduling is one of keys to cloud
services. To model and evaluate different scheduling policies and algorithms,
we propose FlexCloud, a flexible and scalable simulator that enables users to
simulate the process of initializing cloud data centers, allocating virtual
machine requests and providing performance evaluation for various scheduling
algorithms. FlexCloud can be run on a single computer with JVM to simulate
large scale cloud environments with focus on infrastructure as a service;
adopts agile design patterns to assure the flexibility and extensibility;
models virtual machine migrations which is lack in the existing tools; provides
user-friendly interfaces for customized configurations and replaying. Comparing
to existing simulators, FlexCloud has combining features for supporting public
cloud providers, load-balance and energy-efficiency scheduling. FlexCloud has
advantage in computing time and memory consumption to support large-scale
simulations. The detailed design of FlexCloud is introduced and performance
evaluation is provided.
