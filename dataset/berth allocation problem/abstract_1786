We describe all solutions of the matrix Hamburger moment problem in a general
case (no conditions besides solvability are assumed). We use the fundamental
results of A.V. Shtraus on the generalized resolvents of symmetric operators.
All solutions of the truncated matrix Hamburger moment problem with an odd
number of given moments are described in an "almost nondegenerate" case. Some
conditions of solvability for the scalar truncated Hamburger moment problem
with an even number of given moments are given.
