This paper illustrates asymptotic properties for a response-adaptive design
generated by a two-color, randomly reinforced urn model. The design considered
is optimal in the sense that it assigns patients to the best treatment, with
probability converging to one. An approach to show the joint asymptotic
normality of the estimators of the mean responses to the treatments is provided
in spite of the fact that allocation proportions converge to zero and one.
Results on the rate of convergence of the number of patients assigned to each
treatment are also obtained. Finally, we study the asymptotic behavior of a
suitable test statistic.
