We introduce the notion of specular sets which are subsets of groups called
here specular and which form a natural generalization of free groups. These
sets are an abstract generalization of the natural codings of linear
involutions. We prove several results concerning the subgroups generated by
return words and by maximal bifix codes in these sets.
