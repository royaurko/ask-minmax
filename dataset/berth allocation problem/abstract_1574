Coordination in multi-agent system is very essential, in order to perform
complex tasks and lead MAS towards its goal. Also, the member agents of
multi-agent system should be autonomous as well as collaborative to accomplish
the complex task for which multi-agent system is designed specifically.
Contract-Net Protocol (CNP) is one of the coordination mechanisms which is used
by multi-agent systems which prefer coordination through interaction protocols.
In order to overcome the limitations of conventional CNP, this paper proposes a
modification in conventional CNP called updated-CNP. Updated-CNP is an effort
towards updating of a CNP in terms of its limitations of modifiability and
communication overhead. The limitation of the modification of tasks, if the
task requirements change at any instance, corresponding to tasks which are
allocated to contractor agents by manager agents is possible in our updated-CNP
version, which was not possible in the case of conventional-CNP, as it has to
be restarted in the case of task modification. This in turn will be reducing
the communication overhead of CNP, which is time taken by various agents using
CNP to pass messages to each other. For the illustration of the updated CNP, we
have used a sound predator-prey case study.
