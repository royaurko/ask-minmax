We consider a wireless channel shared by multiple transmitter-receiver pairs.
Their transmissions interfere with each other. Each transmitter-receiver pair
aims to maximize its long-term average transmission rate subject to an average
power constraint. This scenario is modeled as a stochastic game under different
assumptions. We first assume that each transmitter and receiver has knowledge
of all direct and cross link channel gains. We later relax the assumption to
the knowledge of incident channel gains and then further relax to the knowledge
of the direct link channel gains only. In all the cases, we formulate the
problem of finding the Nash equilibrium as a variational inequality (VI)
problem and present an algorithm to solve the VI.
