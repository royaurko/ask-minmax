A common flaw of astronomers is to believe that they know the truth even when
data is scarce. I provide ten examples where this approach led to wrong
strategic decisions in research plans, causing unnecessary delays in finding
the truth. In order to make the discovery process more efficient, I advocate
affirmative action for diversity of ideas by telescope-time allocation
committees and funding agencies.
