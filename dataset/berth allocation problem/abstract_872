Balancing treatment allocation for influential covariates is critical in
clinical trials. This has become increasingly important as more and more
biomarkers are found to be associated with different diseases in translational
research (genomics, proteomics and metabolomics). Stratified permuted block
randomization and minimization methods [Pocock and Simon Biometrics 31 (1975)
103-115, etc.] are the two most popular approaches in practice. However,
stratified permuted block randomization fails to achieve good overall balance
when the number of strata is large, whereas traditional minimization methods
also suffer from the potential drawback of large within-stratum imbalances.
Moreover, the theoretical bases of minimization methods remain largely elusive.
In this paper, we propose a new covariate-adaptive design that is able to
control various types of imbalances. We show that the joint process of
within-stratum imbalances is a positive recurrent Markov chain under certain
conditions. Therefore, this new procedure yields more balanced allocation. The
advantages of the proposed procedure are also demonstrated by extensive
simulation studies. Our work provides a theoretical tool for future research in
this area.
