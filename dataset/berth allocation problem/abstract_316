The minimization of some multivariate risk indicators may be used as an
allocation method, as proposed in C\'enac et al. [6]. The aim of capital
allocation is to choose a point in a simplex, according to a given criterion.
In a previous paper [17] we proved that the proposed allocation technique
satisfies a set of coherence axioms. In the present one, we study the
properties and asymptotic behavior of the allocation for some distribution
models. We analyze also the impact of the dependence structure on the
allocation using some copulas.
