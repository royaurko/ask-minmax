In this paper, we establish two different characterizations of Walrasian
expectations allocations by the veto power of the grand coalition in an
asymmetric information economy having finite numbers of agents and states of
nature and whose commodity space is a Banach lattice. The first one deals with
Aubin non-dominated allocations, and the other claims that an allocation is a
Walrasian expectations allocation if and only if it is not privately dominated
by the grand coalition, by considering perturbations of the original initial
endowments in precise directions.
