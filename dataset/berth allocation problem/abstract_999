The predictive power of the h-index has been shown to depend for a long time
on citations to rather old publications. This has raised doubts about its
usefulness for predicting future scientific achievements. Here I investigate a
variant which considers only the recent publications and is therefore more
useful in academic hiring processes and for the allocation of research
resources. It is simply defined in analogy to the usual h-index, but taking
into account only the publications from recent years, and it can easily be
determined from the ISI Web of Knowledge.
