We study the problem of determining the optimal univariate subspace for
maximising the separability of a binary partition of unlabeled data, as
measured by spectral graph theory. This is achieved by ?nding projections which
minimise the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrices of the projected data,
which corresponds to a non-convex, non-smooth optimisation problem. We show
that the optimal projection based on spectral connectivity converges to the
vector normal to the maximum margin hyperplane through the data, as the scaling
parameter is reduced to zero. This establishes a connection between
connectivity as measured by spectral graph theory and maximal Euclidean
separation. It also allows us to apply our methodology to the problem of ?nding
large margin linear separators. The computational cost associated with each
eigen-problem is quadratic in the number of data. To mitigate this problem, we
propose an approximation method using microclusters with provable approximation
error bounds. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on simulated
and publicly available data sets and ?nd that it compares favourably with
existing methods for projection pursuit and dimension reduction for
unsupervised data partitioning.
