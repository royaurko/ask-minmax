The Six Degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) is a spectroscopic survey of the
southern sky, which aims to provide positions and velocities of galaxies in the
nearby Universe. We present here the adaptive tiling algorithm developed to
place 6dFGS fields on the sky, and allocate targets to those fields. Optimal
solutions to survey field placement are generally extremely difficult to find,
especially in this era of large-scale galaxy surveys, as the space of available
solutions is vast (2N dimensional) and false optimal solutions abound. The
6dFGS algorithm utilises the Metropolis (simulated annealing) method to
overcome this problem. By design the algorithm gives uniform completeness
independent of local density, so as to result in a highly complete and uniform
observed sample. The adaptive tiling achieves a sampling rate of approximately
95%, a variation in the sampling uniformity of less than 5%, and an efficiency
in terms of used fibres per field of greater than 90%. We have tested whether
the tiling algorithm systematically biases the large-scale structure in the
survey by studying the two-point correlation function of mock 6dF volumes. Our
analysis shows that the constraints on fibre proximity with 6dF lead to
under-estimating galaxy clustering on small scales (< 1 Mpc) by up to ~20%, but
that the tiling introduces no significant sampling bias at larger scales.
