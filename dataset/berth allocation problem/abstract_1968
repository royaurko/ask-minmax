We consider the linear integro-differential operator $L$ defined by \[ Lu(x)
=\int_\Rn (u(x+y) - u(x) - 1_{[1,2]}(\alpha) 1_{\{|y|\leq 2\}}(y)y \cdot \nabla
u(x)) k(x,y) \sd y . \] Here the kernel $k(x,y)$ behaves like
$|y|^{-d-\alpha}$, $\alpha \in (0,2)$, for small $y$ and is H\"older-continuous
in the first variable, precise definitions are given below. The aim of this
work is twofold. On one hand, we study the unique solvability of the Cauchy
problem corresponding to $L$. On the other hand, we study the martingale
problem for $L$. The analytic results obtained for the deterministic parabolic
equation guarantee that the martingale problem is well-posed. Our strategy
follows the classical path of Stroock-Varadhan. The assumptions allow for cases
that have not been dealt with so far.
