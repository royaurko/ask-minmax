This paper proposes a dual-connectivity (DC) profile allocation algorithm, in
which a central macro base station (MBS) is underlaid with randomly scattered
small base stations (SBSs), operating on different carrier frequencies. We
introduce two dual-connectivity profiles and the differences among them. We
utilize the characteristics of dual-connectivity profiles and their applying
scenarios to reduce feasible combination set to consider. Algorithm analysis
and numerical results verify that our proposed algorithm achieve the optimal
algorithm's performance within 5 \% gap with quite low complexity up to $10^6$
times.
