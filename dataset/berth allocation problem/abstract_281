A new type of exact solutions for photogravitational restricted three-body
problem (a case of spiral motion) is presented here. A key point is that we
obtain the appropriate specific case of spiral motions from the Jacobian-type
integral of motion for photogravitational restricted three-body problem (when
orbit of small 3-rd body is assumed to be like a spiral). Besides, we should
especially note that there is a proper restriction to the type of spiral
orbital motion of small 3-rd body, which could be possible for choosing as the
exact solution of equations for photogravitational restricted three-body
problem. The main result, which should be outlined, is that in a case of
quasi-planar orbital motion (of the small 3-rd body) the asymptotic expression
for component z of motion is proved to be given by the proper elliptical
integral.
