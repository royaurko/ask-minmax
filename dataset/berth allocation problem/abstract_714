In a centralized or cloud radio access network, certain portions of the
digital baseband processing of a group of several radio access points are
executed at a central data center. Centralizing the processing improves the
flexibility, scalability, and utilization of computational assets. However, the
performance depends critically on how the limited data processing resources are
allocated to serve the needs of the different wireless devices. As the
processing load imposed by each device depends on its allocated transmission
rate and channel quality, the rate-allocation aspect of the scheduling should
take into account the available computing. In this paper, two computationally
aware schedulers are proposed that have the objective of maximizing the
sum-rate of the system while satisfying a constraint on the offered
computational load. The first scheduler optimally allocates resources and is
implemented according to a water-filling algorithm. The second scheduler is
suboptimal, but uses a simpler and intuitive complexity-cut-off approach. The
performance of both schedulers is evaluated using an LTE-compliant system level
simulator. It is found that both schedulers avoid outages that are caused by an
overflow of computational load (i.e., computational outages) at the cost of a
slight loss of sum-rate.
