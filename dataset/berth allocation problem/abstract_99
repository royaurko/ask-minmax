We consider the distributed uplink resource allocation problem in a
multi-carrier wireless network with multiple access points (APs). Each mobile
user can optimize its own transmission rate by selecting a suitable AP and by
controlling its transmit power. Our objective is to devise suitable algorithms
by which mobile users can jointly perform these tasks in a distributed manner.
Our approach relies on a game theoretic formulation of the joint power control
and AP selection problem. In the proposed game, each user is a player with an
associated strategy containing a discrete variable (the AP selection decision)
and a continuous vector (the power allocation among multiple channels). We
provide characterizations of the Nash Equilibrium of the proposed game, and
present a set of novel algorithms that allow the users to efficiently optimize
their rates. Finally, we study the properties of the proposed algorithms as
well as their performance via extensive simulations.
