The Cloud Computing paradigm is providing system architects with a new
powerful tool for building scalable applications. Clouds allow allocation of
resources on a "pay-as-you-go" model, so that additional resources can be
requested during peak loads and released after that. However, this flexibility
asks for appropriate dynamic reconfiguration strategies. In this paper we
describe SAVER (qoS-Aware workflows oVER the Cloud), a QoS-aware algorithm for
executing workflows involving Web Services hosted in a Cloud environment. SAVER
allows execution of arbitrary workflows subject to response time constraints.
SAVER uses a passive monitor to identify workload fluctuations based on the
observed system response time. The information collected by the monitor is used
by a planner component to identify the minimum number of instances of each Web
Service which should be allocated in order to satisfy the response time
constraint. SAVER uses a simple Queueing Network (QN) model to identify the
optimal resource allocation. Specifically, the QN model is used to identify
bottlenecks, and predict the system performance as Cloud resources are
allocated or released. The parameters used to evaluate the model are those
collected by the monitor, which means that SAVER does not require any
particular knowledge of the Web Services and workflows being executed. Our
approach has been validated through numerical simulations, whose results are
reported in this paper.
