Cell Switch-Off (CSO) is recognized as a promising approach to reduce the
energy consumption in next-generation cellular networks. However, CSO poses
serious challenges not only from the resource allocation perspective but also
from the implementation point of view. Indeed, CSO represents a difficult
optimization problem due to its NP-complete nature. Moreover, there are a
number of important practical limitations in the implementation of CSO schemes
such as the need for minimizing the real-time complexity and the number of
transitions as well as handovers. This article introduces a novel approach to
CSO based on multiobjective optimization that makes use of the statistical
description of the service demand (known by operators). In addition, downlink
and uplink coverage criteria are included and a comparative analysis between
different models to characterize intercell interference is also presented to
shed light on their impact on CSO. The method distinguishes itself from the
other proposals in two ways: 1) The number of cell switch on/off transitions as
well as handovers are minimized, and 2) the computationally-heavy part of the
algorithm is executed offline, which makes its implementation feasible. The
results show that the proposed scheme achieves substantial energy savings in
small cell deployments where traffic is highly unbalanced, with neither
compromising the Quality-of-Service (QoS) nor requiring heavy real-time
processing.
