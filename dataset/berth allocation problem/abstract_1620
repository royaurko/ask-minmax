This paper builds on an innovative Information Retrieval tool, Ariadne. The
tool has been developed as an interactive network visualization and browsing
tool for large-scale bibliographic databases. It basically allows to gain
insights into a topic by contextualizing a search query (Koopman et al., 2015).
In this paper, we apply the Ariadne tool to a far smaller dataset of 111,616
documents in astronomy and astrophysics. Labeled as the Berlin dataset, this
data have been used by several research teams to apply and later compare
different clustering algorithms. The quest for this team effort is how to
delineate topics. This paper contributes to this challenge in two different
ways. First, we produce one of the different cluster solution and second, we
use Ariadne (the method behind it, and the interface - called LittleAriadne) to
display cluster solutions of the different group members. By providing a tool
that allows the visual inspection of the similarity of article clusters
produced by different algorithms, we present a complementary approach to other
possible means of comparison. More particular, we discuss how we can - with
LittleAriadne - browse through the network of topical terms, contributors, journals
and cluster solutions in the Berlin dataset and compare cluster solutions as
well as see their context.
