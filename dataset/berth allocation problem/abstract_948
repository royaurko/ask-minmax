In this letter we determine the derivative of the mutual information
corresponding to bit-interleaved coded modulation systems. The derivative
follows as a linear combination of minimum-mean-squared error functions of
coded modulation sets. The result finds applications to the analysis of
communications systems in the wideband regime and to the design of power
allocation over parallel channels.
