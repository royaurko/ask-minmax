Threshold-type counts based on multivariate occupancy models with log concave
marginals admit bounded size biased couplings under weak conditions, leading to
new concentration of measure results for random graphs, germ-grain models in
stochastic geometry, multinomial allocation models and multivariate
hypergeometric sampling. The work generalizes and improves upon previous
results in a number of directions.
