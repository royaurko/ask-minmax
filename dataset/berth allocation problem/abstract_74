This paper investigates an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM)-based wireless powered communication system, where one user harvests
energy from an energy access point (EAP) to power its information transmission
to a data access point (DAP). The channels from the EAP to the user, i.e., the
wireless energy transfer (WET) link, and from the user to the DAP, i.e., the
wireless information transfer (WIT) link, vary over time slots and sub-channels
(SCs). To avoid interference at DAP, WET and WIT are scheduled over orthogonal
SCs at any slot. Our objective is to maximize the achievable rate at the DAP by
jointly optimizing the SC allocation over time and the power allocation over
time and SCs for both WET and WIT links. Assuming availability of full channel
state information (CSI), the structural results for the optimal SC/power
allocation are obtained and an offline algorithm is proposed to solve the
problem. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity online algorithm when causal
CSI is available.
