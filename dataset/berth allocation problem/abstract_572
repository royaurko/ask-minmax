In the prevailing scenario audio, video, data services (i.e. internet),
multimedia and broadcasting etc. are being integrated. Decreasing cell size
increases capacity but at the same time increases fluctuation and interference
too. The intelligence approach is the only answer in developing countries where
frequency and power are scarce resources. In this paper, we have tried to
integrate all proven technologies in networking such as in-building network,
micro zone, intelligent micro cell, deployment along city streets, tunnels,
subway coverage etc. along with adaptive frequency allocation in hierarchical
approach with the help of adaptive / intelligent antenna system. A-SDMA
approach will further enhance spectral efficiency as well as QoS (Quality of
Service). It can be proved beyond doubt that this integrated approach will
convert 2G / 2.5G systems capable of handling the prevailing demand at reduced
cost. In addition to it, integrated approach will save power and reduce RF
pollution. In this paper we have explained the ill effect of cellular growth in
terms of health hazard and increased power consumption. We have also suggested
ways and means to overcome these problems (spectral density / capacity, QoS,
power consumption and RF pollution etc.).
