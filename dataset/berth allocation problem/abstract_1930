This is a continuation of two recent publications of the contributors about
reconstruction procedures for 3-d phaseless inverse scattering problems. The
main novelty of this paper is that the Born approximation for the case of the
wave-like equation is not considered. It is shown here that the phaseless
inverse scattering problem for the 3-d wave-like equation in the frequency
domain leads to the well known Inverse Kinematic Problem. Uniqueness theorem
follows. Still, since the Inverse Kinematic Problem is very hard to solve, a
linearization is applied. More precisely, geodesic lines are replaced with
straight lines. As a result, an approximate explicit reconstruction formula is
obtained via the inverse Radon transform. The second reconstruction method is
via solving a problem of the integral geometry using integral equations of the
Abel type.
