We investigate cooperative radar and communications signaling. While each
system typically considers the other system a source of interference, by
considering the radar and communications operations to be a single joint
system, the performance of both systems can, under certain conditions, be
improved by the existence of the other. As an initial demonstration, we focus
on the radar as relay scenario and present an approach denoted multiuser
detection radar (MUDR). A novel joint estimation and information theoretic
bound formulation is constructed for a receiver that observes communications
and radar return in the same frequency allocation. The joint performance bound
is presented in terms of the communication rate and the estimation rate of the
system.
