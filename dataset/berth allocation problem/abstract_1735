In the open problem session of the FPSAC'03, R.P.Stanley gave an open
problem. The purpose of this paper is to give a proof of this open problem. At
the end of this paper we present certain corollaries involving the Big Schur
functions and some polynomials arising from the Macdonald polynomials, which
generalize Stanley's open problem.
