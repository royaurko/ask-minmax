This paper considers a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system
where the source intends to transmit independent information to the users at
targeted data rates under statistical channel state information at the
transmitter. The problem of outage balancing among the users is studied with
the issues of power allocation, decoding order selection, and user grouping
being taken into account. Specifically, with regard to the max-min fairness
criterion, we derive the optimal power allocation in closed-form and prove the
corresponding optimal decoding order for the elementary downlink NOMA system.
By assigning a weighting factor for each user, the analytical results can be
used to evaluate the outage performance of the downlink NOMA system under
various fairness constraints. Further, we investigate the case with user
grouping, in which each user group can be treated as an elementary downlink
NOMA system. The associated problems of power and resource allocation among
different user groups are solved. The implementation complexity issue of NOMA
is also considered with focus on that caused by successive interference
cancellation and user grouping. The complexity and performance tradeoff is
analyzed by simulations, which provides fruitful insights for the practical
application of NOMA. The simulation results substantiate our analysis and show
considerable performance gain of NOMA when compared with orthogonal multiple
access.
