In this paper, the resource management problem in geographically distributed
cloud systems is considered. The Follow Me Cloud concept which enables service
migration across federated data centers (DCs) is adopted. Therefore, there are
two types of service requests to the DC, i.e., new requests (NRs) initiated in
the local service area and migration requests (MRs) generated when mobile users
move across service areas. A novel resource management scheme is proposed to
help the resource manager decide whether to accept the service requests (NRs or
MRs) or not and determine how much resources should be allocated to each
service (if accepted). The optimization objective is to maximize the average
system reward and keep the rejection probability of service requests under a
certain threshold. Numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme can
significantly improve the overall system utility as well as the user experience
compared with other resource management schemes.
