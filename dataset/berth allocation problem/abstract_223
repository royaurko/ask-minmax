We consider the multi-unit random assignment problem in which agents express
preferences over objects and objects are allocated to agents randomly based on
the preferences. The most well-established preference relation to compare
random allocations of objects is stochastic dominance (SD) which also leads to
corresponding notions of envy-freeness, efficiency, and weak strategyproofness.
We show that there exists no rule that is anonymous, neutral, efficient and
weak strategyproof. For single-unit random assignment, we show that there
exists no rule that is anonymous, neutral, efficient and weak
group-strategyproof. We then study a generalization of the PS (probabilistic
serial) rule called multi-unit-eating PS and prove that multi-unit-eating PS
satisfies envy-freeness, weak strategyproofness, and unanimity.
