Peak to average power ratio (PAPR) constrained power allocation in single
carrier multiuser (MU) single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems with
iterative frequency domain (FD) soft cancelation (SC) minimum mean squared
error (MMSE) equalization is considered in this paper. To obtain full benefit
of the iterative receiver, its convergence properties need to be taken into
account also at the transmitter side. In this paper, we extend the existing
results on the area of convergence constrained power allocation (CCPA) to
consider the instantaneous PAPR at the transmit antenna of each user. In other
words, we will introduce a constraint that PAPR cannot exceed a predetermined
threshold. By adding the aforementioned constraint into the CCPA optimization
framework, the power efficiency of a power amplifier (PA) can be significantly
enhanced by enabling it to operate on its linear operation range. Hence, PAPR
constraint is especially beneficial for power limited cell-edge users. In this
paper, we will derive the instantaneous PAPR constraint as a function of
transmit power allocation. Furthermore, successive convex approximation is
derived for the PAPR constrained problem. Numerical results show that the
proposed method can achieve the objectives described above.
