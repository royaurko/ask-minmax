Analysis of welfare in auctions comes traditionally via one of two
approaches: precise but fragile inference of the exact details of a setting
from data or robust but coarse theoretical price of anarchy bounds that hold in
any setting. As markets get more and more dynamic and bidders become more and
more sophisticated, the weaknesses of each approach are magnified.
  In this paper, we provide tools for analyzing and estimating the
\emph{empirical price of anarchy} of an auction. The empirical price of anarchy
is the worst case efficiency loss of any auction that \emph{could have produced
the data}, relative to the optimal.
  Our techniques are based on inferring simple properties of auctions:
primarily the expected revenue and the expected payments and allocation
probabilities from possible bids. These quantities alone allow us to
empirically estimate the revenue covering parameter of an auction which allows
us to re-purpose the theoretical machinery of \citet{HHT14} for empirical
purposes. Moreover, we show that under general conditions the revenue covering
parameter estimated from the data approaches the true parameter with the error
decreasing at the rate proportional to the square root of the number of
auctions and at most polynomially in the number of agents. While we focus on
the setting of position auctions, and particularly the generalized second price
auction, our techniques are applicable far more generally.
  Finally, we apply our techniques to a selection of advertising auctions on
Microsoft's Bing and find empirical results that are a significant improvement
over the theoretical worst-case bounds.
