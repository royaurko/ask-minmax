When simulating a complex stochastic system, the behavior of the output
response depends on the input parameters estimated from finite real-world data,
and the finiteness of data brings input uncertainty to the output response. The
quantification of the impact of input uncertainty on output response has been
extensively studied. Most of the existing literature focuses on providing
inferences on the mean output response with respect to input uncertainty,
including point estimation and confidence interval construction of the mean
response. However, risk assessment of the mean response with respect to input
uncertainty often plays an important role in system evaluation/control because
it quantifies the behavior of the mean response under extreme input models. To
the best of our knowledge, it has been rarely systematically studied in the
literature. In the present paper, we will fill in the gap and introduce risk
measures for input uncertainty in output analysis. We develop nested Monte
Carlo estimators and construct (asymptotically valid) confidence intervals for
risk measures of mean response. We further study the associated budget
allocation problem for more efficient nested simulation of the estimators, and
propose a novel method to solve the problem.
