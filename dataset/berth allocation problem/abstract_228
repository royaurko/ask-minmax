In this letter, we investigate the tradeoff between energy efficiency (EE)
and spectral efficiency (SE) in device-to-device (D2D) communications
underlaying cellular networks with uplink channel reuse. The resource
allocation problem is modeled as a noncooperative game, in which each user
equipment (UE) is self-interested and wants to maximize its own EE. Given the
SE requirement and maximum transmission power constraints, a distributed
energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm is proposed by exploiting the
properties of the nonlinear fractional programming. The relationships between
the EE and SE tradeoff of the proposed algorithm and system parameters are
analyzed and verified through computer simulations.
