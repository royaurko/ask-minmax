We consider an extremum problem posed by Turan. The aim of this problem is to
find a maximum mean value of 1-periodic continuous even function such that sum
of Fourier coefficient modules for this function is equal to 1 and support of
this function lies in $[-h,h]$, $0<h\le 1/2$. We show that this extremum
problem for rational $h=p/q$ is equivalent two finite-dimensional linear
programming problems. Here there are exact results for rational $h=2/q$,
$h=p/(2p+1)$, $h=3/q$, and asymptotic equalities.
