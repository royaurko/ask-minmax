Recommender systems are promising ways to filter the overabundant information
in modern society. Their algorithms help individuals to explore decent items,
but it is unclear how they allocate popularity among items. In this paper, we
simulate successive recommendations and measure their influence on the
dispersion of item popularity by Gini coefficient. Our result indicates that
local diffusion and collaborative filtering reinforce the popularity of hot
items, widening the popularity dispersion. On the other hand, the heat
conduction algorithm increases the popularity of the niche items and generates
smaller dispersion of item popularity. Simulations are compared to mean-field
predictions. Our results suggest that recommender systems have reinforcing
influence on global diversification.
