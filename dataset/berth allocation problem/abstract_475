the MIAPE Gel Electrophoresis (MIAPE-GE) guidelines specify the minimum
information that should be provided when reporting the use of n-dimensional gel
electrophoresis in a proteomics experiment. Developed through a joint effort
between the gel-based analysis working group of the Human Proteome
Organisation's Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI;
http://www.psidev.info/) and the wider proteomics community, they constitute
one part of the overall Minimum Information about a Proteomics Experiment
(MIAPE) documentation system published last August in Nature Biotechnology
