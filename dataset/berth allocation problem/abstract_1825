We prove that a uniformly bounded system of orthonormal functions satisfying
the $\psi_2$ condition: (1) must contain a Sidon subsystem of proportional
size, (2) must satisfy the Rademacher-Sidon property, and (3) must have its
5-fold tensor satisfy the Sidon property. On the other hand, we construct a
uniformly bounded orthonormal system that satisfies the $\psi_2$ condition but
which is not Sidon. These problems are variants of Kaczmarz's Scottish book
problem (problem 130) which, in its original formulation, was answered
negatively by Rudin. A corollary of our argument is a new, elementary proof of
Pisier's theorem that a set of characters satisfying the $\psi_2$ condition is
Sidon.
