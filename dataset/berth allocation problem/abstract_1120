The wide band of frequencies that includes all those allocated to 2G/3G
applications was defined as 2G/3G band and the discone antenna with a structure
of radial wires was defined as radial discone. This antenna was theoretically
analysed and software simulated with the purpose of computationally design a
broadband model of it. As an application, a radial discone for operation from
800 to 3000 MHz, which include the 2G/3G band, was designed and an experimental
model was built and tested. Mathematically expressed measurement error bounds
were computed in order to evaluate the agreement between theory and practice.
