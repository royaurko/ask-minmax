Cloud Computing is an emerging area. The main aim of the initial
search-and-rescue period after strong earthquakes is to reduce the whole number
of mortalities. One main trouble rising in this period is to and the greatest
assignment of available resources to functioning zones. For this issue a
dynamic optimization model is presented. The model uses thorough descriptions
of the operational zones and of the available resources to determine the
resource performance and efficiency for different workloads related to the
response. A suitable solution method for the model is offered as well. In this
paper, Earthquake Disaster Based Resource Scheduling (EDBRS) Framework has been
proposed. The allocation of resources to cloud workloads based on urgency
(emergency during Earthquake Disaster). Based on this criterion, the resource
scheduling algorithm has been proposed. The performance of the proposed
algorithm has been assessed with the existing common scheduling algorithms
through the CloudSim. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm
outperforms the existing algorithms by reducing execution cost and time of
cloud consumer workloads submitted to the cloud.
