We give a hybrid two stage design which can be useful to estimate the
reliability of a parallel-series and/or by duality a series-parallel system,
when the component reliabilities are unknown as well as the total numbers of
units allowed to be tested in each subsystem. When a total sample size is fixed
large, asymptotic optimality is proved systematically and validated via Monte
Carlo simulation.
