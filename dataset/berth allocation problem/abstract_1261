Distribution of seats in The European Parliament postulated by Treaty of
Lisbon should be degressively proportional. The meaning of degressively
proportional concept can be found in two principles annexed to the draft of
European Parliament resolution. The first, referred as the principle of fair
division, states that "the larger the population of a Member State, the greater
is entitlement to a large number of seats". The other condition, referred to as
the principle of relative proportionality, holds that "the larger the
population of a country, the more inhabitants are represented by each of its
Members of the EU". We postulate a clear and fair method which determines
uniquely a distribution of seats in the European Parliament which fulfil the
requirements of degressive proportionality. More generally, let $l_i$ be any
non-increasing sequence of real positive numbers. We say that a sequence of
natural numbers $m_{i}$ is degressively proportional with respect to the
sequence $l_{i}$, if $m_{i}$ and $l_{i}/m_{i}$ are non-increasing sequences.
Our method can be instrumental in uniquely determining a degressively
proportional sequence $m_{i}$ with respect to $l_{i}$ which fulfils given
conditions.
