The average phase factor of the QCD fermion determinant signals the strength
of the QCD sign problem. We compute the average phase factor as a function of
temperature and baryon chemical potential using a two-flavor NJL model. This
allows us to study the strength of the sign problem at and above the chiral
transition. It is discussed how the $U_A(1)$ anomaly affects the sign problem.
Finally, we study the interplay between the sign problem and the endpoint of
the chiral transition.
