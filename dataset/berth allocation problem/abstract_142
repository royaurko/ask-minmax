The housing market setting constitutes a fundamental model of exchange
economies of goods. In most of the work concerning housing markets, it is
assumed that agents own and are allocated discrete houses. The drawback of this
assumption is that it does not cater for randomized assignments or allocation
of time-shares. Recently, house allocation with fractional endowment of houses
was considered by Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) who posed the open
problem of generalizing Gale's Top Trading Cycles (TTC) algorithm to the case
of housing markets with fractional endowments. In this paper, we address the
problem and present a generalization of TTC called FTTC that is polynomial-time
as well as core stable and Pareto optimal with respect to stochastic dominance
even if there are indifferences in the preferences. We prove that if each agent
owns one discrete house, FTTC coincides with a state of the art strategyproof
mechanism for housing markets with discrete endowments and weak preferences.
  We show that FTTC satisfies a maximal set of desirable properties by proving
two impossibility theorems. Firstly, we prove that with respect to stochastic
dominance, core stability and no justified envy are incompatible. Secondly, we
prove that there exists no individual rational, Pareto optimal and weak
strategyproof mechanism, thereby answering another open problem posed by
Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011). The second impossibility implies a number
of results in the literature.
