Raman spectroscopies are carried out by the Method polarizable examinations
of the lattice oscillations of p-chloronitrobenzene at temperature 293 K. The
led matching of spectrums of p-chloronitrobenzene with p-bromochlorobenzene and
p-dibromobenzene has shown that the significant line broadening in
p-chloronitrobenzene is caused not only clutter in allocation of molecules
concerning parasubstitution benzol. It is necessary to consider also and
clutter in rotational displacements of the nitro of group concerning a plane of
a molecule. Calculations of frequency spectra were led on a method the Dyne.
