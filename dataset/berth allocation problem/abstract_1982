In this paper we introduce a notion of causal transference plans on Polish
spaces. These plans are probabilities on the product space which generalize the
adapted processes of stochastic calculus in the same way as the
Monge-Kantorovich transference plans generalize the Monge transference plans.
We provide a detailed study of their main properties. Then we introduce the
associated causal transport problems and we prove a very general result of
existence of solutions to the causal Monge-Kantorovich problems. Finally we
relate these problems to stochastic optimal control, and we investigate the
transports of the Wiener measure for the quadratic cost. Weak solutions to some
stochastic differential equations whose solutions can be obtained by
transformation of the drift then appear as optimal transference plans to these
causal Monge-Kantorovich problems, while the existence of a unique strong
solution to these equations is related to the existence of an optimum of Monge.
In this case, the causal counterpart of the Wasserstein distance is the square
root of the relative entropy.
