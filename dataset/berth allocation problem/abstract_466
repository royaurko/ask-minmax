With the increase of wireless communication demands, licensed spectrum for
long term evolution (LTE) is no longer enough. The research effort has focused
on implementing LTE to unlicensed frequency bands in recent years, which
unavoidably brings the problem of LTE co-existence with other existing systems
on the same band. This paper proposes an adaptive co-existence mechanism for
LTE and wireless local area networks (WLAN) to enable a significant system
performance of WLAN while LTE does not lose much as well. LTE realizes the
co-existence by allocating time resources dynamically according to the traffic
load of WLAN system.
