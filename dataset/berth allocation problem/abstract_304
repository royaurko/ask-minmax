Designing cost-effective and scalable backhaul solutions is one of the main
challenges for emerging wireless small cell networks (SCNs). In this regard,
millimeter wave (mmW) communication technologies have recently emerged as an
attractive solution to realize the vision of a high-speed and reliable wireless
small cell backhaul network (SCBN). In this paper, a novel approach is proposed
for managing the spectral resources of a heterogeneous SCBN that can exploit
simultaneously mmW and conventional frequency bands via carrier aggregation. In
particular, a new SCBN model is proposed in which small cell base stations
(SCBSs) equipped with broadband fiber backhaul allocate their frequency
resources to SCBSs with wireless backhaul, by using aggregated bands. One
unique feature of the studied model is that it jointly accounts for both
wireless channel characteristics and economic factors during resource
allocation. The problem is then formulated as a one-to-many matching game and a
distributed algorithm is proposed to find a stable outcome of the game. The
convergence of the algorithm is proven and the properties of the resulting
matching are studied. Simulation results show that under the constraints of
wireless backhauling, the proposed approach achieves substantial performance
gains, reaching up to $30 \%$ compared to a conventional best-effort approach.
