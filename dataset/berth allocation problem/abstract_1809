This paper studies the problem of model-checking of probabilistic automaton
and probabilistic one-counter automata against probabilistic branching-time
temporal logics (PCTL and PCTL$^*$). We show that it is undecidable for these
problems.
  We first show, by reducing to emptiness problem of probabilistic automata,
that the model-checking of probabilistic finite automata against branching-time
temporal logics are undecidable. And then, for each probabilistic automata, by
constructing a probabilistic one-counter automaton with the same behavior as
questioned probabilistic automata the undecidability of model-checking problems
against branching-time temporal logics are derived, herein.
