In this paper we introduce a class of Markov decision processes that arise as
a natural model for many renewable resource allocation problems. Upon extending
results from the inventory control literature, we prove that they admit a
closed form solution and we show how to exploit this structure to speed up its
computation. We consider the application of the proposed framework to several
problems arising in very different domains, and as part of the ongoing effort
in the emerging field of Computational Sustainability we discuss in detail its
application to the Northern Pacific Halibut marine fishery. Our approach is
applied to a model based on real world data, obtaining a policy with a
guaranteed lower bound on the utility function that is structurally very
different from the one currently employed.
