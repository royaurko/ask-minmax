The Maximum Balanced Subgraph Problem (MBSP) is the problem of finding a
subgraph of a signed graph that is balanced and maximizes the cardinality of
its vertex set. We are interested in the exact solution of the problem: an
improved version of a branch-and-cut algorithm is proposed. Extensive
computational experiments are carried out on a set of instances from three
applications previously discussed in the literature as well as on a set of
random instances.
