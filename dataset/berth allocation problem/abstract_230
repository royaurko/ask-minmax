As the proportion of total power supplied by renewable sources increases, it
gets more costly to use reserve generation to compensate for the variability of
renewables like solar and wind. Hence attention has been drawn to exploiting
flexibility in demand as a substitute for reserve generation. Flexibility has
different attributes. In this paper we consider loads requiring a constant
power for a specified duration (within say one day), whose flexibility resides
in the fact that power may be delivered at any time so long as the total
duration of service equals the load's specified duration. We give conditions
under which a variable power supply is adequate to meet these flexible loads,
and describe how to allocate the power to the loads. We also characterize the
additional power needed when the supply is inadequate. We study the problem of
allocating the available power to loads to maximize welfare, and show that the
welfare optimum can be sustained as a competitive equilibrium in a forward
market in which electricity is sold as service contracts differentiated by the
duration of service and power level. We compare this forward market with a spot
market in their ability to capture the flexiblity inherent in
duration-differentiated loads.
