In this paper, a novel context-aware approach for resource allocation in
two-tier wireless small cell networks~(SCNs) is proposed. In particular, the
SCN's users are divided into two types: frequent users, who are regular users
of certain small cells, and occasional users, who are one-time or infrequent
users of a particular small cell. Given such \emph{context} information, each
small cell base station (SCBS) aims to maximize the overall performance
provided to its frequent users, while ensuring that occasional users are also
well serviced. We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game in which the
SCBSs are the players. The strategy of each SCBS is to choose a proper power
allocation so as to optimize a utility function that captures the tradeoff
between the users' quality-of-service gains and the costs in terms of resource
expenditures. We provide a sufficient condition for the existence and
uniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the game, and we show that
this condition is independent of the number of users in the network. Simulation
results show that the proposed context-aware resource allocation game yields
significant performance gains, in terms of the average utility per SCBS,
compared to conventional techniques such as proportional fair allocation and
sum-rate maximization.
