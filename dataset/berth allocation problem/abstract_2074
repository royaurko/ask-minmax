We introduce a distributed source coding scheme called successive Wyner-Ziv
coding. We show that any point in the rate region of the quadratic Gaussian CEO
problem can be achieved via the successive Wyner-Ziv coding. The concept of
successive refinement in the single source coding is generalized to the
distributed source coding scenario, which we refer to as distributed successive
refinement. For the quadratic Gaussian CEO problem, we establish a necessary
and sufficient condition for distributed successive refinement, where the
successive Wyner-Ziv coding scheme plays an important role.
