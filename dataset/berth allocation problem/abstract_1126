The fading broadcast channel with confidential messages (BCC) is
investigated, where a source node has common information for two receivers
(receivers 1 and 2), and has confidential information intended only for
receiver 1. The confidential information needs to be kept as secret as possible
from receiver 2. The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be known at
both the transmitter and the receivers. The secrecy capacity region is first
established for the parallel Gaussian BCC, and the optimal source power
allocations that achieve the boundary of the secrecy capacity region are
derived. In particular, the secrecy capacity region is established for the
Gaussian case of the Csiszar-Korner BCC model. The secrecy capacity results are
then applied to give the ergodic secrecy capacity region for the fading BCC.
