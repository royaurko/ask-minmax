We present a novel bio-inspired and dynamic coding scheme for static images.
Our coder aims at reproducing the main steps of the visual stimulus processing
in the mammalian retina taking into account its time behavior. The main novelty
of this work is to show how to exploit the time behavior of the retina cells to
ensure, in a simple way, scalability and bit allocation. To do so, our main
source of inspiration will be the biologically plausible retina model called
Virtual Retina. Following a similar structure, our model has two stages. The
first stage is an image transform which is performed by the outer layers in the
retina. Here it is modelled by filtering the image with a bank of difference of
Gaussians with time-delays. The second stage is a time-dependent
analog-to-digital conversion which is performed by the inner layers in the
retina. Thanks to its conception, our coder enables scalability and bit
allocation across time. Also, our decoded images do not show annoying artefacts
such as ringing and block effects. As a whole, this article shows how to
capture the main properties of a biological system, here the retina, in order
to design a new efficient coder.
