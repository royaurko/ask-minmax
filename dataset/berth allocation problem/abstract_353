Despite the fact that the Euler allocation principle has been adopted by many
financial institutions for their internal capital allocation process, a
comprehensive description of Euler allocation seems still to be missing. We try
to fill this gap by presenting the theoretical background as well as practical
aspects. In particular, we discuss how Euler risk contributions can be
estimated for some important risk measures. We furthermore investigate the
analysis of CDO tranche expected losses by means of Euler's theorem and suggest
an approach to measure the impact of risk factors on non-linear portfolios.
