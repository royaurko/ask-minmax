There is an increasing demand for P2P streaming in particular for layered
video. In this category of applications, the stream is composed of
hierarchically encoded sub-streams layers namely the base layer and
enhancements layers. We consider a scenario where the receiver peer uses the
pull-based approach to adjust the video quality level to their capability by
subscribing to different number of layers. We note that higher layers received
without their corresponding lower layers are considered as useless and cannot
be played, consequently the throughput of the system will drastically degrade.
To avoid this situation, we propose an economical model based on auction
mechanisms to optimize the allocation of sender peers' upload bandwidth. The
upstream peers organize auctions to "sell" theirs items (links' bandwidth)
according to bids submitted by the downstream peers taking into consideration
the peers priorities and the requested layers importance. The ultimate goal is
to satisfy the quality level requirement for each peer, while reducing the
overall streaming cost. Through theoretical study and performance evaluation we
show the effectiveness of our model in terms of users and network's utility.
