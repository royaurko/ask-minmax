In this note we raise a variant of a classic problem in extremal graph
theory. The problem is motivated by design of fractional repetitions code, a
model in distributed storage systems. For a any feasible positive integers
$d\geq 3$, $n \geq 3$, and $k$, $n-1 \leq k \leq \binom{n}{2}$, what is the
minimum possible number of vertices in a $d$-regular undirected graph whose
subgraphs with $n$ vertices contain at most $k$ edges? For this Tur\'{a}n-type
problem we present an almost complete solution for $3 \leq n \leq 5$. Our goal
is to give the exact number of vertices for each instance of the problem,
although at some points we will consider only large $d$.
