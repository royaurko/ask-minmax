In this work, we conduct a joint analysis of both Vector Space and Language
Models for IR using the mathematical framework of Quantum Theory. We shed light
on how both models allocate the space of density matrices. A density matrix is
shown to be a general representational tool capable of leveraging capabilities
of both VSM and LM representations thus paving the way for a new generation of
retrieval models. We analyze the possible implications suggested by our
findings.
