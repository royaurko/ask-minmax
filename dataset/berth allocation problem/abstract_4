Systematic task allocation to different development sites in global software
de- velopment projects can open business and engineering perspectives and help
to reduce risks and problems inherent in distributed development. Relying only
on a single evaluation criterion such as development cost when distributing
tasks to development sites has shown to be very risky and often does not lead
to successful solutions in the long run. Task allocation in global software
projects is challenging due to a multitude of impact factors and constraints.
Systematic allocation decisions require the ability to evaluate and compare
task allocation alternatives and to effectively establish customized task
allocation practices in an organization. In this article, we present a
customizable process for task allocation evaluation that is based on results
from a systematic interview study with practitioners. In this process, the
relevant criteria for evaluating task allocation alternatives are derived by
applying principles from goal-oriented measurement. In addition, the
customization of the process is demonstrated, related work and limitations are
sketched, and an outlook on future work is given.
