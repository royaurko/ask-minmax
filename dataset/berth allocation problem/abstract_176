Cloud computing focuses on delivery of reliable, secure, fault-tolerant,
sustainable, and scalable infrastructures for hosting Internet-based
application services. These applications have different composition,
configuration, and deployment requirements. Quantifying the performance of
scheduling and allocation policy on a Cloud infrastructure (hardware, software,
services) for different application and service models under varying load,
energy performance (power consumption, heat dissipation), and system size is an
extremely challenging problem to tackle. To simplify this process, in this
paper we propose CloudSim: a new generalized and extensible simulation
framework that enables seamless modelling, simulation, and experimentation of
emerging Cloud computing infrastructures and management services. The
simulation framework has the following novel features: (i) support for
modelling and instantiation of large scale Cloud computing infrastructure,
including data centers on a single physical computing node and java virtual
machine; (ii) a self-contained platform for modelling data centers, service
brokers, scheduling, and allocations policies; (iii) availability of
virtualization engine, which aids in creation and management of multiple,
independent, and co-hosted virtualized services on a data center node; and (iv)
flexibility to switch between space-shared and time-shared allocation of
processing cores to virtualized services.
