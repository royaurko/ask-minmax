LTE release 12 proposes the use of dual connectivity in heterogeneous
cellular networks, where a user equipment (UE) maintains parallel connections
to a macro-cell node (base station) and to a low-tier node (pico base station
or relay). In this paper, we propose a distributed multi-objective power
control scheme where each UE independently adapts its transmit power on its
dual connections, possibly of unequal bandwidth, with non-ideal backhaul links.
In the proposed scheme, the UEs can dynamically switch their objectives between
data rate maximization and transmit power minimization as the backhaul load
varies. Given the coupling between interference and the backhaul load, we
propose a low-overhead convergence mechanism which does not require explicit
coordination between autonomous nodes and also derive a closed-form expression
of the transmit power levels at equilibrium. We illustrate a higher aggregate
end-to-end data rate and significant power saving for our scheme over when the
optimization is implemented through a greedy algorithm or when UEs only perform
waterfilling.
