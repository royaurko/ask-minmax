4G wireless access systems require high spectral efficiency to support the
ever increasing number of users and data rates for real time applications.
Multi-antenna OFDM-SDMA systems can provide the required high spectral
efficiency and dynamic usage of the channel, but the resource allocation
process becomes extremely complex because of the augmented degrees of freedom.
In this paper, we propose two heuristics to solve the resource allocation
problem that have very low computational complexity and give performances not
far from the optimal. The proposed heuristics select a set of users for each
subchannel, but contrary to the reported methods that solve the throughput
maximization problem, our heuristics consider the set of real-time (RT) users
to ensure that their minimum rate requirements are met. We compare the
heuristics' performance against an upper bound and other methods proposed in
the literature and find that they give a somewhat lower performance, but
support a wider range of minimum rates while reducing the computational
complexity. The gap between the objective achieved by the heuristics and the
upper bound is not large. In our experiments this gap is 10.7% averaging over
all performed numerical evaluations for all system configurations. The increase
in the range of the supported minimum rates when compared with a method
reported in the literature is 14.6% on average.
