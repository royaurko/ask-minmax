We consider the unit-demand envy-free pricing problem, which is a unit-demand
auction where each bidder receives an item that maximizes his utility, and the
goal is to maximize the auctioneer's profit. This problem is NP-hard and
unlikely to be in APX. We present four new MIP formulations for it and
experimentally compare them to a previous one due to Shioda, Tun\c{c}el, and
Myklebust. We describe three models to generate different random instances for
general unit-demand auctions, that we designed for the computational
experiments. Each model has a nice economic interpretation. Aiming
approximation results, we consider the variant of the problem where the item
prices are restricted to be chosen from a geometric series, and prove that an
optimal solution for this variant has value that is a fraction (depending on
the series used) of the optimal value of the original problem. So this variant
is also unlikely to be in APX.
