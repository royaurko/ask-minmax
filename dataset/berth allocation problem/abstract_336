Despite the occurrence of elegant algorithms for solving complex problem,
exhaustive search has retained its significance since many real-life problems
exhibit no regular structure and exhaustive search is the only possible
solution. The advent of high-performance computing either via multicore
processors or distributed processors emphasizes the possibility for exhaustive
search by multiple search agents. Here we analyse the performance of exhaustive
search when it is conducted by multiple search agents. Several strategies for
cooperation between the search agents are evaluated. We discover that the
performance of the search improves with the increase in the level of
cooperation. Same search performance can be achieved with homogeneous and
heterogeneous search agents provided that the length of subregions allocated to
individual search regions follow the differences in the speeds of heterogeneous
search agents.
