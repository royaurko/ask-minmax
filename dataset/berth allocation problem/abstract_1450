The current study examines how adequate coordination among different
cognitive processes including visual recognition, attention switching, action
preparation and generation can be developed via learning of robots by
introducing a novel model, the Visuo-Motor Deep Dynamic Neural Network (VMDNN).
The proposed model is built on coupling of a dynamic vision network, a motor
generation network, and a higher level network allocated on top of these two.
The simulation experiments using the iCub simulator were conducted for
cognitive tasks including visual object manipulation responding to human
gestures. The results showed that synergetic coordination can be developed via
iterative learning through the whole network when spatio-temporal hierarchy and
temporal one can be self-organized in the visual pathway and in the motor
pathway, respectively, such that the higher level can manipulate them with
abstraction.
