The artificial noise (AN) scheme, proposed by Goel and Negi, is being
considered as one of the key enabling technology for secure communications over
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channels. However, the decrease
in secrecy rate due to the increase in the number of Eve's antennas is not well
understood. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework to characterize
the secrecy rate of the AN scheme as a function of Eve's signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), Bob's SNR, the number of antennas in each terminal, and the power
allocation scheme. We first derive a closed-form expression for the average
secrecy rate. We then derive a closed-form expression for the asymptotic
instantaneous secrecy rate with large number of antennas at all terminals.
Finally, we derive simple lower and upper bounds on the average and
instantaneous secrecy rate that provide a tool for the system design.
