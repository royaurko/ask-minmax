Classic cake cutting protocols -- which fairly allocate a divisible good
among agents with heterogeneous preferences -- are susceptible to manipulation.
Do their strategic outcomes still guarantee fairness? To answer this question
we adopt a novel algorithmic approach, proposing a concrete computational model
and reasoning about the game-theoretic properties of algorithms that operate in
this model. Specifically, we show that each protocol in the class of
generalized cut and choose (GCC) protocols -- which includes the most important
discrete cake cutting protocols -- is guaranteed to have approximate subgame
perfect Nash equilibria. Moreover, we observe that the (approximate) equilibria
of proportional protocols -- which guarantee each of the n agents a
1/n-fraction of the cake -- must be (approximately) proportional, and design a
GCC protocol where all Nash equilibrium outcomes satisfy the stronger fairness
notion of envy-freeness. Finally, we show that under an obliviousness
restriction, which still allows the computation of approximately envy-free
allocations, GCC protocols are guaranteed to have exact subgame perfect Nash
equilibria.
