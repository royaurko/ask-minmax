An efficient method for computing solutions to the Optimal Transportation
(OT) problem with a wide class of cost functions is presented. The standard
linear programming (LP) discretization of the continuous problem becomes
intractible for moderate grid sizes. A grid refinement method results in a
linear cost algorithm. Weak convergence of solutions is stablished. Barycentric
projection of transference plans is used to improve the accuracy of solutions.
The method is applied to more general problems, including partial optimal
transportation, and barycenter problems. Computational examples validate the
accuracy and efficiency of the method. Optimal maps between nonconvex domains,
partial OT free boundaries, and high accuracy barycenters are presented.
