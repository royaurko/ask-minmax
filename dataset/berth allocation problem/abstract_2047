In a wireless sensor network, the virtual backbone plays an important role.
Due to accidental damage or energy depletion, it is desirable that the virtual
backbone is fault-tolerant. A fault-tolerant virtual backbone can be modeled as
a k-connected m-fold dominating set ((k,m)-CDS for short). In this paper, we
present a constant approximation algorithm for the minimum weight (k,m)-CDS
problem in unit disk graph under the assumption that m>=k. Prior to this work,
constant approximation algorithms are known for k=1 with weight and 2<=k<=3
without weight. Our result is the first constant approximation algorithm for
the (k,m)-CDS problem with general k,m and with weight. The performance ratio
is (\alpha+5\rho) for k>=3 and (\alpha+2.5\rho) for k=2, where \alpha is the
performance ratio for the minimum weight m-fold dominating set problem and \rho
is the performance ratio for the subset k-connected subgraph problem. Using
currently best known ratios for \alpha and \rho, the performance ratio is
(k^2\log k) for k>=3 and (8+\epsilon) for k=2, where \epsilon is an arbitrary
positive real number.
