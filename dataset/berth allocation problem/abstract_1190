In this paper, we perform a cost-benefit analysis of multiuser diversity in
single antenna broadcast channels. It is well known that multiuser diversity
can be beneficial but there is a significant cost associated with acquiring
instantaneous CSI. We perform a cost-benefit analysis of multiuser diversity
for 2 types of CSI feedback methods, dedicated feedback and SNR dependent
feedback, quantifying how many users should feedback CSI from a net throughput
perspective. Dedicated feedback, in which orthogonal resources are allocated to
each user, has significant feedback cost and this limits the amount of
available multiuser diversity that can be used. SNR dependent feedback method,
in which only users with SNR above a threshold attempt to feedback, has
relatively much smaller feedback cost and this allows for all of the available
multiuser diversity to be used. Next, we study the effect of single user
multiantenna techniques, which reduce the SNR variation, on the number of
feedback users neccessary. It is seen that a broadcast channel using single
user multiantenna techniques should reduce the number of feedback users with
the spatial dimension.
