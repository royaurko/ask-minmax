Software testing is a prime factor in software industry. Besides knowing the
importance of testing, only limited time is allocated for teaching it. It will
be more efficient if testing is taught simultaneously with programming
foundations. This integrated learning of testing techniques and programming
allows the programmers to perform in a better way and this leads to the
improvement of the performance of the industry progress. In this paper, a
technique named ontology is introduced, it first defines the various testing
process in hierarchy and define relationships among them, to share and reuse
the knowledge that is captured, secondly metadata is created by natural
language processing and finally, the application use ontologies to support test
management, it act as knowledge base for multiple environment with the
integrated teaching of programming foundation and testing concepts. Keywords:
