While there exist now formulations of initial boundary value problems for
Einstein's field equations which are well posed and preserve constraints and
gauge conditions, the question of geometric uniqueness remains unresolved. For
two different approaches we discuss how this difficulty arises under general
assumptions. So far it is not known whether it can be overcome without imposing
conditions on the geometry of the boundary. We point out a natural and
important class of initial boundary value problems which may offer
possibilities to arrive at a fully covariant formulation.
