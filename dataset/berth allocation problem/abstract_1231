For each software project a plan is developed, according to a documented
procedure, that covers the software activities and commitments. The
requirements allocated to software form the basis for the software development
plan. Estimates for critical computer resources are documented, reviewed, and
agreed to. All affected groups and individuals understand the estimates and
plans and commit to support them. Senior management reviews the estimates and
plans before external commitments are made. Software risks associated with the
cost, resources, schedule, and technical aspects of the project are identified
and evaluated, and contingencies are documented. Planning and estimation data
are collected for use in planning subsequent projects and for input in
management oversight review meetings.
