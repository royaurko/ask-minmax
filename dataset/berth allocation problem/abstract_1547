We characterize the near-IR sky background from 308 observations with the
FIRE spectrograph at Magellan. A subset of 105 observations selected to
minimize lunar and thermal effects gives a continuous, median spectrum from
0.83 to 2.5 microns which we present in electronic form. The data are used to
characterize the broadband continuum emission between atmospheric OH features
and correlate its properties with observing conditions such as lunar angle and
time of night. We find that the moon contributes significantly to the
inter-line continuum in the Y and J bands whereas the observed H band continuum
is dominated by the blended Lorentzian wings of multiple OH line profiles even
at R=6000. Lunar effects may be mitigated in Y and J through careful scheduling
of observations, but the most ambitious near-IR programs will benefit from
allocation during dark observing time if those observations are not limited by
read noise. In Y and J our measured continuum exceeds space-based average
estimates of the Zodiacal light, but it is not readily identified with known
terrestrial foregrounds. If further measurements confirm such a fundamental
background, it would impact requirements for OH-suppressed instruments
operating in this regime.
