As storage systems become increasingly heterogeneous and complex, it adds
burdens on DBAs, causing suboptimal performance even after a lot of human
efforts have been made. In addition, existing monitoring-based storage
management by access pattern detections has difficulties to handle workloads
that are highly dynamic and concurrent. To achieve high performance by best
utilizing heterogeneous storage devices, we have designed and implemented a
heterogeneity-aware software framework for DBMS storage management called
hStorage-DB, where semantic information that is critical for storage I/O is
identified and passed to the storage manager. According to the collected
semantic information, requests are classified into different types. Each type
is assigned a proper QoS policy supported by the underlying storage system, so
that every request will be served with a suitable storage device. With
hStorage-DB, we can well utilize semantic information that cannot be detected
through data access monitoring but is particularly important for a hybrid
storage system. To show the effectiveness of hStorage-DB, we have implemented a
system prototype that consists of an I/O request classification enabled DBMS,
and a hybrid storage system that is organized into a two-level caching
hierarchy. Our performance evaluation shows that hStorage-DB can automatically
make proper decisions for data allocation in different storage devices and make
substantial performance improvements in a cost-efficient way.
