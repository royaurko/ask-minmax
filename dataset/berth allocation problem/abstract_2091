We discuss the four-dimensional cosmological constant problem in a
five-dimensional setting. A scalar field coupled to the SM forms dynamically a
smooth brane with four-dimensional Poincare invariance, independently of SM
physics. In this respect, our solution may be regarded as a self-tuning
solution, free of any singularities and fine-tuning problems.
