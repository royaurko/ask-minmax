Linear precoding and cooperative jamming for multiuser broadcast channel is
studied to enhance the physical layer security. We consider the system where
multiple independent data streams are transmitted from the base station to
multiple legitimate users with the help of a friendly jammer. It is assumed
that a normalized linear precoding matrix is given at the base station, whereas
the power allocated to each user is to be determined. The problem is to jointly
design the power allocation across different users for linear precoding and the
cooperative jamming at the friendly jammer. The goal is to maximize a lower
bound of the secrecy rate, provided that a minimum communication rate to the
users is guaranteed. The optimal solution is obtained when the number of
antennas at the friendly jammer is no less than the total number of antennas at
the users and eavesdropper. Moreover, a suboptimal algorithm is proposed, which
can be applied for all the scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed schemes are effective for secure communications.
