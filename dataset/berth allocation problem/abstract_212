In this article, we discuss the optimal allocation problem in an experiment
when a regression model is used for statistical analysis. Monotonic convergence
for a general class of multiplicative algorithms for $D$-optimality has been
discussed in the literature. Here, we provide an alternate proof of the
monotonic convergence for $D$-criterion with a simple computational algorithm
and furthermore show it converges to the $D$-optimality. We also discuss an
algorithm as well as a conjecture of the monotonic convergence for
$A$-criterion. Monte Carlo simulations are used to demonstrate the reliability,
efficiency and usefulness of the proposed algorithms.
