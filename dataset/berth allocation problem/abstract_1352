We analyze the coverage probability of multi-user uplink cellular networks
with fractional power control. We use a stochastic geometry approach where the
mobile users are distributed as a Poisson Point Process (PPP), whereas the
serving base station (BS) is placed at the origin. Using conditional thinning,
we are able to calculate the coverage probability of $k$ users which are
allocated a set of orthogonal resources in the cell of interest, obtaining
analytical expressions for this probability considering their respective
distances to the serving BS. These expressions give useful insights on the
interplay between the power control policy, the interference level and the
degree of fairness among different users in the system.
