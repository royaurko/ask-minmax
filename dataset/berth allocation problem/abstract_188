Energy harvesting and physical-layer security in wireless networks are of
great significance. In this paper, we study the simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) in downlink orthogonal
frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, where each user applies
power splitting to coordinate the energy harvesting and information decoding
processes while secrecy information requirement is guaranteed. The problem is
formulated to maximize the aggregate harvested power at the users while
satisfying secrecy rate requirements of all users by subcarrier allocation and
the optimal power splitting ratio selection. Due to the NP-hardness of the
problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm. The numerical results
show that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods.
