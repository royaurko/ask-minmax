In this paper, we propose a transceiver architecture for full-duplex (FD)
eNodeB (eNB) and FD user equipment (UE) transceiver. For FD
communication,.i.e., simultaneous in-band uplink and downlink operation, same
subcarriers can be allocated to UE in both uplink and downlink. Hence, contrary
to traditional LTE, we propose using single-carrier frequency division multiple
accesses (SC-FDMA) for downlink along with the conventional method of using it
for uplink. The use of multiple antennas at eNB and singular value
decomposition (SVD) in the downlink allows multiple users (MU) to operate on
the same set of ubcarriers. In the uplink, successive interference cancellation
with optimal ordering (SSIC-OO) algorithm is used to decouple signals of UEs
operating in the same set of subcarriers. A smart antenna approach is adopted
which prevents interference, in downlink of a UE, from uplink signals of other
UEs sharing same subcarriers. The approach includes using multiple antennas at
UEs to form directed beams towards eNode and nulls towards other UEs. The
proposed architecture results in significant improvement of the overall
spectrum efficiency per cell of the cellular network.
