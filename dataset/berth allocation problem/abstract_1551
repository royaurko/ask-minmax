A variety of mathematical tools have been developed for predicting the
spreading patterns in a number of varied environments including infectious
diseases, computer viruses, and urgent messages broadcast to mobile agent
(e.g., humans, vehicles, and mobile devices). These tools have mainly focused
on estimating the average time for the spread to reach a fraction (e.g.,
$\alpha$) of the agents, i.e., the so-called average completion time
$E(T_{\alpha})$. We claim that providing probabilistic guarantee on the time
for the spread $T_{\alpha}$ rather than only its average gives a much better
understanding of the spread, and hence could be used to design improved methods
to prevent epidemics or devise accelerated methods for distributing data. To
demonstrate the benefits, we introduce a new metric $G_{\alpha, \beta}$ that
denotes the time required to guarantee $\alpha$ completion with probability
$\beta$, and develop a new framework to characterize the distribution of
$T_\alpha$ for various spread parameters such as number of seeds, level of
contact rates, and heterogeneity in contact rates. We apply our technique to an
experimental mobility trace of taxies in Shanghai and show that our framework
enables us to allocate resources (i.e., to control spread parameters) for
acceleration of spread in a far more efficient way than the state-of-the-art.
