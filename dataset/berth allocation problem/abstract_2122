In order to analyze numerically inverse problems several techniques based on
linear and nonlinear stability analysis are presented. These techniques are
illustrated on the problem of estimating mobilities and capillary pressure in
one-dimensional two-phase displacements in porous media that are performed in
laboratories. This is an example of the problem of estimating nonlinear
coefficients in a system of nonlinear partial differential equations.
