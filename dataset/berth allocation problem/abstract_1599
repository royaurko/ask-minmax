The variety of existing cloud services creates a challenge for service
providers to enforce reasonable Software Level Agreements (SLA) stating the
Quality of Service (QoS) and penalties in case QoS is not achieved. To avoid
such penalties at the same time that the infrastructure operates with minimum
energy and resource wastage, constant monitoring and adaptation of the
infrastructure is needed. We refer to Software-Defined Cloud Computing, or
simply Software-Defined Clouds (SDC), as an approach for automating the process
of optimal cloud configuration by extending virtualization concept to all
resources in a data center. An SDC enables easy reconfiguration and adaptation
of physical resources in a cloud infrastructure, to better accommodate the
demand on QoS through a software that can describe and manage various aspects
comprising the cloud environment. In this paper, we present an architecture for
SDCs on data centers with emphasis on mobile cloud applications. We present an
evaluation, showcasing the potential of SDC in two use cases-QoS-aware
bandwidth allocation and bandwidth-aware, energy-efficient VM placement-and
discuss the research challenges and opportunities in this emerging area.
