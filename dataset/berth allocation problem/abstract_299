In this work, we analyze hybrid ARQ (HARQ) protocols over the independent
block fading channel. We assume that the transmitter is unaware of the channel
state information (CSI) but has a knowledge about the channel statistics. We
consider two scenarios with respect to the feedback received by the
transmitter: i) ''conventional'', one-bit feedback about the decoding
success/failure (ACK/NACK), and ii) the multi-bit feedback scheme when, on top
of ACK/NACK, the receiver provides additional information about the state of
the decoder to the transmitter. In both cases, the feedback is used to allocate
(in the case of one-bit feedback) or adapt (in the case of multi-bit feedback)
the power across the HARQ transmission attempts. The objective in both cases is
the minimization of the outage probability under long-term average and peak
power constraints. We cast the problems into the dynamic programming (DP)
framework and solve them for Nakagami-m fading channels. A simplified solution
for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime is presented using a geometric
programming (GP) approach. The obtained results quantify the advantage of the
multi-bit feedback over the conventional approach, and show that the power
optimization can provide significant gains over conventional power-constant
HARQ transmissions even in the presence of peak-power constraints.
