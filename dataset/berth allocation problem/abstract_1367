Science and engineering research increasingly relies on activities that
facilitate research but are not currently rewarded or recognized, such as: data
sharing; developing common data resources, software and methodologies; and
annotating data and publications. To promote and advance these activities, we
must develop mechanisms for assigning credit, facilitate the appropriate
attribution of research outcomes, devise incentives for activities that
facilitate research, and allocate funds to maximize return on investment. In
this article, we focus on addressing the issue of assigning credit for both
direct and indirect contributions, specifically by using JSON-LD to implement a
prototype transitive credit system.
