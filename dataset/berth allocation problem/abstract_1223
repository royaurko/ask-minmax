In this article, a survey of several important equilibrium concepts for
decentralized networks is presented. The term decentralized is used here to
refer to scenarios where decisions (e.g., choosing a power allocation policy)
are taken autonomously by devices interacting with each other (e.g., through
mutual interference). The iterative long-term interaction is characterized by
stable points of the wireless network called equilibria. The interest in these
equilibria stems from the relevance of network stability and the fact that they
can be achieved by letting radio devices to repeatedly interact over time. To
achieve these equilibria, several learning techniques, namely, the best
response dynamics, fictitious play, smoothed fictitious play, reinforcement
learning algorithms, and regret matching, are discussed in terms of information
requirements and convergence properties. Most of the notions introduced here,
for both equilibria and learning schemes, are illustrated by a simple case
study, namely, an interference channel with two transmitter-receiver pairs.
