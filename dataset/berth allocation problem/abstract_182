This paper investigates the simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) for two-hop orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
decode-and-forward (DF) relay communication system, where a relay harvests
energy from radio frequency signals transmitted by the source and then uses the
harvested energy to assist the information transmission from the source to its
destination. The power splitting receiver is considered at the relay, which
splits the received signal into two power streams to perform information
decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) respectively. For better understanding
the behavior and exploring the performance limit of such a system, resource
allocation is studied to maximize the total achievable transmission rate. An
optimization problem, which jointly takes into account the power allocation,
the subcarrier pairing and the power splitting, is formulated. Due to its
non-convexity, a resource allocation policy with low complexity based on
separation principle is designed. Simulation results show that the system
performance can be significantly improved by using our proposed policy.
Moreover, the system performance behavior to the relay position is also
discussed, and results show that in the two-hop OFDM system with EH relay, the
relay should be deployed near the source, while in that with conventional
non-EH relay, it should be deployed at the middle between the source and the
destination.
