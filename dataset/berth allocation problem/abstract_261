We consider the problem of online graph multi-coloring with advice.
Multi-coloring is often used to model frequency allocation in cellular
networks. We give several nearly tight upper and lower bounds for the most
standard topologies of cellular networks, paths and hexagonal graphs. For the
path, negative results trivially carry over to bipartite graphs, and our
positive results are also valid for bipartite graphs. The advice given
represents information that is likely to be available, studying for instance
the data from earlier similar periods of time.
