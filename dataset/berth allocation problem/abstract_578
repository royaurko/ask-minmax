The latest trends in high-performance computing systems show an increasing
demand on the use of a large scale multicore systems in a efficient way, so
that high compute-intensive applications can be executed reasonably well.
However, the exploitation of the degree of parallelism available at each
multicore component can be limited by the poor utilization of the memory
hierarchy available. Actually, the multicore architecture introduces some
distinct features that are already observed in shared memory and distributed
environments. One example is that subsets of cores can share different subsets
of memory. In order to achieve high performance it is imperative that a careful
allocation scheme of an application is carried out on the available cores,
based on a scheduling model that considers the main performance bottlenecks, as
for example, memory contention. In this paper, the {\em Multicore Cluster
Model} (MCM) is proposed, which captures the most relevant performance
characteristics in multicores systems such as the influence of memory hierarchy
and contention. Better performance was achieved when a load balance strategy
for a Branch-and-Bound application applied to the Partitioning Sets Problem is
based on MCM, showing its efficiency and applicability to modern systems.
