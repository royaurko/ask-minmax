In this paper we study the truncated matrix trigonometric moment problem. We
obtained a bijective parameterization of all solutions of this moment problem
(both in nondegenerate and degenerate cases) via an operator approach. We use
important results of M.E.~Chumakin on generalized resolvents of isometric
operators.
