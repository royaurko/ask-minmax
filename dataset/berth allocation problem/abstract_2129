Modeling emotion has become a challenge nowadays. Therefore, several models
have been produced in order to express human emotional activity. However, only
a few of them are currently able to express the close relationship existing
between emotion and cognition. An appraisal-coping model is presented here,
with the aim to simulate the emotional impact caused by the evaluation of a
particular situation (appraisal), along with the consequent cognitive reaction
intended to face the situation (coping). This model is applied to the
?Cascades? problem, a small arithmetical exercise designed for ten-year-old
pupils. The goal is to create a model corresponding to a child's behavior when
solving the problem using his own strategies.
