(abridged for arXiv) The BEER algorithm searches stellar light curves for the
BEaming, Ellipsoidal, and Reflection photometric modulations that are caused by
a short-period companion. Applying the search to the first five long-run center
CoRoT fields, we identified $481$ non-eclipsing candidates with periodic flux
amplitudes of $0.5-87$ mmag. Optimizing the Anglo-Australian-Telescope pointing
coordinates and the AAOmega fiber-allocations with dedicated softwares, we
acquired six spectra for $231$ candidates and seven spectra for another $50$
candidates in a seven-night campaign. Analysis of the red-arm AAOmega spectra,
which covered the range of $8342-8842\AA{}$, yielded a radial-velocity
precision of $\sim1$ km/s. Spectra containing lines of more than one star were
analyzed with the two-dimensional correlation algorithm TODCOR. The measured
radial velocities confirmed the binarity of seventy of the BEER candidates$-45$
single-line binaries, $18$ double-line binaries, and $7$ diluted binaries. We
show that red giants introduce a major source of false candidates and
demonstrate a way to improve BEER's performance in extracting higher fidelity
samples from future searches of CoRoT light curves. The periods of the
confirmed binaries span a range of $0.3-10$ days and show a rise in the number
of binaries per $\Delta$log$P$ toward longer periods. The estimated mass ratios
of the double-line binaries and the mass ratios assigned to the single-line
binaries, assuming an isotropic inclination distribution, span a range of
$0.03-1$. On the low-mass end, we have detected two brown-dwarf candidates on a
$\sim1$ day period orbit. This is the first time non-eclipsing beaming binaries
are detected in CoRoT data, and we estimate that $\sim300$ such binaries can be
detected in the CoRoT long-run light curves.
