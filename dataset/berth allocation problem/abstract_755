Industries are the biggest workplace all over the world, also there are large
number of peoples involves as a worker and most of them are work as a machine
operator. There are many systems developed for industrial work place, some of
them, monitors machine processes and some do monitoring and control of machine
parameters. Such as speed, temperature, production batch count etc. However
there is no such system available that provides monitoring of operator during
their work is in progress at workplace. This paper proposes the monitoring of
the operators and the machines, by Real time Operator -Machine Allocation and
monitoring system (Omams). Omams allocates a work machine to worker at entry
point itself. It uses automation with RFID and one of the standards of wireless
communication method. The system can be industry specific. Through this
research paper our approach is to make fair allocation of machine to the
operator in industry and reduce hassle for efficiency calculations.
