We investigate the regularizing behavior of two-phase Stefan problem near
initial data. The main step in the analysis is to establish that in any given
scale, the scaled solution is very close to a Lipschitz profile in space-time.
We introduce a new decomposition argument to generalize the preceding ones by
Choi, Jerion and Kim([CJK1], [CJK2]) and by Choi and Kim([CK]) on one-phase
problems.
