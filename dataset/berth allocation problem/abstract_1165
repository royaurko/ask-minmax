The transmission of a Gaussian source over a block-fading multiple antenna
channel in the presence of a feedback link is considered. The feedback link is
assumed to be an error and delay free link of capacity 1 bit per channel use.
Under the short-term power constraint, the optimal exponential behavior of the
end-to-end average distortion is characterized for all source-channel bandwidth
ratios. It is shown that the optimal transmission strategy is successive
refinement source coding followed by progressive transmission over the channel,
in which the channel block is allocated dynamically among the layers based on
the channel state using the feedback link as an instantaneous automatic repeat
request (ARQ) signal.
