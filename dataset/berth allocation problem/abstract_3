An analytical framework for performance analysis and optimization of coded
V-BLAST is developed. Average power and/or rate allocations to minimize the
outage probability as well as their robustness and dual problems are
investigated. Compact, closed-form expressions for the optimum allocations and
corresponding system performance are given. The uniform power allocation is
shown to be near optimum in the low outage regime in combination with the
optimum rate allocation. The average rate allocation provides the largest
performance improvement (extra diversity gain), and the average power
allocation offers a modest SNR gain limited by the number of transmit antennas
but does not increase the diversity gain. The dual problems are shown to have
the same solutions as the primal ones. All these allocation strategies are
shown to be robust. The reported results also apply to coded multiuser
detection and channel equalization systems relying on successive interference
cancelation.
