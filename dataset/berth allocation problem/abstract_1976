A result concerning global extrema in a nonsmooth nonconvex variational
problem that appears in applications (e.g. in a large deformation elasticity
problem) is investigated in comparison with a result of D.Y. Gao and R.W.
Ogden. The tools used are elementary and the results derived improve upon and
correct a recent similar result, more precisely, Theorem 4 of the paper
"Closed-form solutions, extremality and nonsmoothness criteria in a large
deformation elasticity problem" by the fore-mentioned contributors.
