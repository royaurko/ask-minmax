Applying traditional collaborative filtering to digital publishing is
challenging because user data is very sparse due to the high volume of
documents relative to the number of users. Content based approaches, on the
other hand, is attractive because textual content is often very informative. In
this paper we describe large-scale content based collaborative filtering for
digital publishing. To solve the digital publishing recommender problem we
compare two approaches: latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and deep belief nets
(DBN) that both find low-dimensional latent representations for documents.
Efficient retrieval can be carried out in the latent representation. We work
both on public benchmarks and digital media content provided by Issuu, an
online publishing platform. This article also comes with a newly developed deep
belief nets toolbox for topic modeling tailored towards performance evaluation
of the DBN model and comparisons to the LDA model.
