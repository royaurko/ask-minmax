In hadoop, the job scheduling is an independent module, users can design
their own job scheduler based on their actual application requirements, thereby
meet their specific business needs. Currently, hadoop has three schedulers:
FIFO, computing capacity scheduling and fair scheduling policy, all of them are
take task allocation strategy that considerate data locality simply. They
neither support data locality well nor fully apply to all cases of jobs
scheduling. In this paper, we took the concept of resources-prefetch into
consideration, and proposed a job scheduling algorithm based on data locality.
By estimate the remaining time to complete a task, compared with the time to
transfer a resources block, to preselect candidate nodes for task allocation.
Then we preselect a non-local map tasks from the unfinished job queue as
resources-prefetch tasks. Getting information of resources blocks of
preselected map task, select a nearest resources blocks from the candidate node
and transferred to local through network. Thus we would ensure data locality
good enough. Eventually, we design a experiment and proved resources-prefetch
method can guarantee good job data locality and reduce the time to complete the
job to a certain extent.
