Large-scale MIMO systems have been considered as one of the possible
candidates for the next-generation wireless communication technique, due to
their potential to provide significant higher throughput than conventional
wireless systems. For such systems, Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Conjugate Beamforming
(CB) precoding have been considered as two possible practical spatial
multiplexing techniques, and their average achievable sum rates have been
derived on the sum power constraint. However, in practice, the transmitting
power at a base station is constrained under each antenna. In this case, the
optimal power allocation is a very difficult problem. In this paper, the
suboptimal power allocation methods for both ZF-based and CB-based precoding in
large-scale MIMO systems under per-antenna constraint are investigated, which
could provide useful references for practice.
