We present a method for explicit leapfrog integration of inseparable
Hamiltonian systems by means of an extended phase space. A suitably defined new
Hamiltonian on the extended phase space leads to equations of motion that can
be numerically integrated by standard symplectic leapfrog (splitting) methods.
When the leapfrog is combined with coordinate mixing transformations, the
resulting algorithm shows good long term stability and error behaviour. We
extend the method to non-Hamiltonian problems as well, and investigate optimal
methods of projecting the extended phase space back to original dimension.
Finally, we apply the methods to a Hamiltonian problem of geodesics in a curved
space, and a non-Hamiltonian problem of a forced non-linear oscillator. We
compare the performance of the methods to a general purpose differential
equation solver LSODE, and the implicit midpoint method, a symplectic one-step
method. We find the extended phase space methods to compare favorably to both
for the Hamiltonian problem, and to the implicit midpoint method in the case of
the non-linear oscillator.
