Fairness is an important performance criterion in all resource allocation
schemes, including those in distributed computer systems. However, it is often
specified only qualitatively. The quantitative measures proposed in the
literature are either too specific to a particular application, or suffer from
some undesirable characteristics. In this paper, we have introduced a
quantitative measure called Indiex of FRairness. The index is applicable to any
resource sharing or allocation problem. It is independent of the amount of the
resource. The fairness index always lies between 0 and 1. This boundedness aids
intuitive understanding of the fairness index. For example, a distribution
algorithm with a fairness of 0.10 means that it is unfair to 90% of the users.
Also, the discrimination index can be defined as 1 - fairness index.
