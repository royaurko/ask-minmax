This paper focuses on the use of unknown input observers for detection and
isolation of actuator and effector faults with control reconfiguration in
overactuated systems. The control allocation actively uses input redundancy in
order to make relevant faults observable. The case study of an overactuated
marine vessel supports theoretical developments.
