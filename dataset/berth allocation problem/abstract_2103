We consider the problem of estimating sparse graphs by a lasso penalty
applied to the inverse covariance matrix. Using a coordinate descent procedure
for the lasso, we develop a simple algorithm that is remarkably fast: in the
worst cases, it solves a 1000 node problem (~500,000 parameters) in about a
minute, and is 50 to 2000 times faster than competing methods. It also provides
a conceptual link between the exact problem and the approximation suggested by
Meinhausen and Buhlmann (2006). We illustrate the method on some cell-signaling
data from proteomics.
