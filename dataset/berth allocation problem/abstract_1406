This paper addresses the radio resource management of multicast transmissions
in the emerging fifth generation satellite systems (5G-Satellite). A
subgrouping approach is exploited to provide video streaming services to
satellite users by splitting any multicast group into subgroups. This allows an
effective exploitation of multi-user diversity according to the experienced
channel conditions and the achievement of a high throughput level. The main
drawback is the high computational cost usually related to the selection of the
optimal subgroup configuration. In this paper we propose a low-complexity
subgrouping algorithm that achieves performance close to optimum. Our solution
is suitable for implementation in practical systems, such as Satellite-Long
Term Evolution (S-LTE), since the computational cost does not depend on the
multicast group size and the number of available resources. Through simulation
campaigns conducted in different radio propagation and multicast group
environments, the effectiveness of the proposed subgroup formation scheme is
assessed.
