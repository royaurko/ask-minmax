We propose several new schedules for Strassen-Winograd's matrix
multiplication algorithm, they reduce the extra memory allocation requirements
by three different means: by introducing a few pre-additions, by overwriting
the input matrices, or by using a first recursive level of classical
multiplication. In particular, we show two fully in-place schedules: one having
the same number of operations, if the input matrices can be overwritten; the
other one, slightly increasing the constant of the leading term of the
complexity, if the input matrices are read-only. Many of these schedules have
been found by an implementation of an exhaustive search algorithm based on a
pebble game.
