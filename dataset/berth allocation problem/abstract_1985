This book considers posing and the methods of solving simple linear
boundary-value problems in classical mathematical physics. The questions
encompassed include: the fundamentals of calculus of variations;
one-dimensional boundary-value problems in the oscillation and heat conduction
theories, with a detailed analysis of the Sturm-Liouville boundary-value
problem and substantiation of the Fourier method; sample solutions of the
corresponding problems in two and three dimensions, with essential elements of
the special function theory. The text is designed for Physics, Engineering, and
Mathematics majors.
