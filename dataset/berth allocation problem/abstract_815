When there is a dispute between players how to divide multiple divisible
commodities, how should it be resolved? In this paper we introduce a
multi-commodity game model. This model enables cooperation between multiple
players to bargain on sharing K commodities, when each player has a different
value for each commodity. It thus extends the sequential discrete Raiffa
solution and the Aumann bankruptcy solution to multi-commodity cases.
