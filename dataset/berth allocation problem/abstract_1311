Hedge funds have long been viewed as a veritable "black box" of investing
since outsiders may never view the exact composition of portfolio holdings.
Therefore, the ability to estimate an informative set of asset weights is
highly desirable for analysis. We present a compositional state space model for
estimation of an investment portfolio's unobserved asset allocation weightings
on a set of candidate assets when the only observed information is the time
series of portfolio returns and the candidate asset returns. In this paper, we
exhibit both sequential Monte Carlo numerical and conditionally Normal
analytical approaches to solve for estimates of the unobserved asset weight
time series. This methodology is motivated by the estimation of monthly asset
class weights on the aggregate hedge fund industry from 1996 to 2012.
Furthermore, we show how to implement the results as predictive investment
weightings in order to construct hedge fund replicating portfolios.
