Generally during recent decades due to development of power systems, the
methods for delivering electrical energy to consumers, and because of voltage
variations is a very important problem, the power plants follow this criteria.
The good solution for improving transfer and distribution of electrical power
the majority of consumers prefer to use energy near the loads .So small units
that are connected to distribution system named "Decentralized Generation" or
"Dispersed Generation". Deregulated in power industry and development of
renewable energies are the most important factors in developing this type of
electricity generation. Today DG has a key role in electrical distribution
systems. For example we can refer to improving reliability indices, improvement
of stability and reduction of losses in power system. One of the key problems
in using DG's, is allocation of these sources in distribution networks. Load
ability in distribution systems and its improvement has an effective role in
the operation of power systems. However, placement of distributed generation
sources in order to improve the distribution system load ability index was not
considered, we show DG placement and allocation with genetic algorithm
optimization method maximize load ability of power systems .This method
implemented on the IEEE Standard bench marks. The results show the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm .Another benefits of DG in selected
positions are also studied and compared.
