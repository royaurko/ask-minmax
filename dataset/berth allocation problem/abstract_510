We investigate energy-efficiency issues and resource allocation policies for
time division multi-access (TDMA) over fading channels in the power-limited
regime. Supposing that the channels are frequency-flat block-fading and
transmitters have full or quantized channel state information (CSI), we first
minimize power under a weighted sum-rate constraint and show that the optimal
rate and time allocation policies can be obtained by water-filling over
realizations of convex envelopes of the minima for cost-reward functions. We
then address a related minimization under individual rate constraints and
derive the optimal allocation policies via greedy water-filling. Using
water-filling across frequencies and fading states, we also extend our results
to frequency-selective channels. Our approaches not only provide fundamental
power limits when each user can support an infinite number of
capacity-achieving codebooks, but also yield guidelines for practical designs
where users can only support a finite number of adaptive modulation and coding
(AMC) modes with prescribed symbol error probabilities, and also for systems
where only discrete-time allocations are allowed.
