Sensor network attitude problem consists in retrieving the attitude of each
sensor of a network knowing some relative orientations between pairs of
sensors. The attitude of a sensor is its orientation in an absolute axis
system. We present in this paper a method for solving the sensor network
attitude problem using quaternion formalism which allows to apply linear
algebra tools. The proposed algorithm solves the problem when all of the
relative attitudes are known. A complete characterisation of the algorithm is
established: spatial complexity, time complexity and robustness. Our algorithm
is validated in simulations and with real experiments.
