In this paper we introduce a new coherent cumulative risk measure on
$\mathcal{R}_L^p$, the space of c\`adl\`ag processes having Laplace transform.
This new coherent risk measure turns out to be tractable enough within a class
of models where the aggregate claims is driven by a spectrally positive L\'evy
process. Moreover, we study the problem of capital allocation in an insurance
context and we show that the capital allocation problem for this risk measure
has a unique solution determined by the Euler allocation method. Some examples
are provided.
