The direct gravimetry problem is solved using the subdivision of each body of
a deposit into a set of vertical adjoining bars, and in the inverse problem
each body of a deposit is modeled by a uniform ellipsoid of revolution
(spheroid). Well-known formulas for z-component of gravitational intensity of a
spheroid are transformed to a convenient form. Parameters of a spheroid are
determined by minimizing the Tikhonov smoothing functional using constraints on
the parameters. This makes the ill-posed inverse problem by unique and stable.
The Bulakh algorithm for initial estimating the depth and mass of a deposit is
modified. The technique is illustrated by numerical model examples of deposits
in the form of two and five bodies. The inverse gravimetry problem is
interpreted as a gravitational tomography problem or the intravision of the
Earth's crust and mantle.
