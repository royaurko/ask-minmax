Permutation codes are a class of structured vector quantizers with a
computationally-simple encoding procedure based on sorting the scalar
components. Using a codebook comprising several permutation codes as subcodes
preserves the simplicity of encoding while increasing the number of
rate-distortion operating points, improving the convex hull of operating
points, and increasing design complexity. We show that when the subcodes are
designed with the same composition, optimization of the codebook reduces to a
lower-dimensional vector quantizer design within a single cone. Heuristics for
reducing design complexity are presented, including an optimization of the rate
allocation in a shape-gain vector quantizer with gain-dependent wrapped
spherical shape codebook.
