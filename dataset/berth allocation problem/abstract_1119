Envy is a rather complex and irrational emotion. In general, it is very
difficult to obtain a measure of this feeling, but in an economical context
envy becomes an observable which can be measured. When various individuals
compare their possessions, envy arises due to the inequality of their different
allocations of commodities and different preferences. In this paper we show
that an equitable distribution of goods does not guarantee a state of fairness
between agents and in general that envy cannot be controlled by tuning the
distribution of goods.
