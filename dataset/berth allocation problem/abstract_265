The object of the research is the adaptive algorithms that are used by the
operator when educating the robotic systems. Operator, being the target-setting
subject, is interested in the goal that robotic systems, being the conductor of
his targets (criteria), would provide a maximum effectiveness of these targets'
(criteria's) achievement. Thus, the adaptive algorithms provide the adequate
reflection of the operator's goals, found in the robotic systems' actions. This
work considers potential possibilities of such target adaption of the robotic
systems used for the class of the allocation problems.
