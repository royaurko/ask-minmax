The reference scenario in this paper is a single cell in a Long Term
Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) system, where multiple user equipments (UEs) aim at
uploading some data to a central server or to the Cloud. The traditional
uploading technique used in cellular systems, i.e., with separate links from
each UE to the eNodeB, is compared to innovative \textit{relay-based} schemes
that exploit Device-to-Device (D2D) communications between two (or more) UEs in
proximity to each other. Differences in the channel quality experienced by the
UEs offer an opportunity to develop D2D-based solutions, where \textit{(i)} the
UE with a poor direct link to the eNodeB will forward data to a nearby UE over
a high-quality D2D link; and \textit{(ii)} the receiving UE then uploads its
own generated data and the relayed data to the eNodeB over a good uplink
channel. A straightforward gain in the data uploading time can be obtained for
the first UE. To extend the benefits, also to the relaying UE, enhanced
D2D-based solutions are proposed that decrease the uploading time of this UE
based on the cooperative sharing of the resources allocated by the eNodeB to
the cooperating devices. Finally, preliminary results are also presented for a
multihop study case, where a chain of devices exploits D2D communications to
upload data to the eNodeB.
