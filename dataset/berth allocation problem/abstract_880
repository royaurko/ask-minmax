We propose a scalable video broadcasting scheme over MIMO-OFDM systems. The
scalable video source layers are channel encoded and modulated into independent
signal streams, which are then transmitted from the allocated antennas in
certain time-frequency blocks. Each receiver employs the successive group
decoder to decode the signal streams of interest by treating other signal
streams as interference. The transmitter performs adaptive coding and
modulation, and transmission antenna and subcarrier allocation, based on the
rate feedback from the receivers. We also propose a hybrid receiver that
switches between the successive group decoder and the MMSE decoder depending on
the rate. Extensive simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance
gain of the proposed group-decoding-based scalable video broadcasting scheme
over the one based on the conventional MMSE decoding.
