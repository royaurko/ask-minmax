The problem of maximizing the average rate in a multicast network subject to
a coverage constraint (minimum quality of service) is studied. Assuming the
channel state information is available only at the receiver side and single
antenna nodes, the highest expected rate achievable by a random user in the
network, called expected typical rate, is derived in two scenarios: hard
coverage constraint and soft coverage constraint. In the first case, the
coverage is expressed in terms of the outage probability, while in the second
case, the expected rate should satisfy certain minimum requirement. It is shown
that the optimum solution in both cases (achieving the highest expected typical
rate for given coverage requirements) is achieved by an infinite layer
superposition code for which the optimum power allocation among the different
layers is derived. For the MISO case, a suboptimal coding scheme is proposed,
which is shown to be asymptotically optimal, when the number of transmit
antennas grows at least logarithmically with the number of users in the
network.
