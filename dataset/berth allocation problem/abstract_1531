We consider the temporally-correlated Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
broadcast channels (BC) and interference channels (IC) where the transmitter(s)
has/have (i) delayed channel state information (CSI) obtained from a
latency-prone feedback channel as well as (ii) imperfect current CSIT,
obtained, e.g., from prediction on the basis of these past channel samples
based on the temporal correlation. The degrees of freedom (DoF) regions for the
two-user broadcast and interference MIMO networks with general antenna
configuration under such conditions are fully characterized, as a function of
the prediction quality indicator. Specifically, a simple unified framework is
proposed, allowing to attain optimal DoF region for the general antenna
configurations and current CSIT qualities. Such a framework builds upon
block-Markov encoding with interference quantization, optimally combining the
use of both outdated and instantaneous CSIT. A striking feature of our work is
that, by varying the power allocation, every point in the DoF region can be
achieved with one single scheme. As a result, instead of checking the
achievability of every corner point of the outer bound region, as typically
done in the literature, we propose a new systematic way to prove the
achievability.
