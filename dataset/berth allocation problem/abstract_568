This paper studies the topic modeling problem of tagged documents and images.
Higher-order relations among tagged documents and images are major and
ubiquitous characteristics, and play positive roles in extracting reliable and
interpretable topics. In this paper, we propose the tag-topic models (TTM) to
depict such higher-order topic structural dependencies within the Markov random
field (MRF) framework. First, we use the novel factor graph representation of
latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic models from the MRF perspective,
and present an efficient loopy belief propagation (BP) algorithm for
approximate inference and parameter estimation. Second, we propose the factor
hypergraph representation of TTM, and focus on both pairwise and higher-order
relation modeling among tagged documents and images. Efficient loopy BP
algorithm is developed to learn TTM, which encourages the topic labeling
smoothness among tagged documents and images. Extensive experimental results
confirm the incorporation of higher-order relations to be effective in
enhancing the overall topic modeling performance, when compared with current
state-of-the-art topic models, in many text and image mining tasks of broad
interests such as word and link prediction, document classification, and tag
recommendation.
