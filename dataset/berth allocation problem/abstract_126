In this work, we deal with resource allocation in the downlink of spatial
multiplexing MIMO-OFDMA systems. In particular, we concentrate on the problem
of jointly optimizing the transmit and receive processing matrices, the channel
assignment and the power allocation with the objective of minimizing the total
power consumption while satisfying different quality-of-service requirements. A
layered architecture is used in which users are first partitioned in different
groups on the basis of their channel quality and then channel assignment and
transceiver design are sequentially addressed starting from the group of users
with most adverse channel conditions. The multi-user interference among users
belonging to different groups is removed at the base station using a
Tomlinson-Harashima pre-coder operating at user level. Numerical results are
used to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed solution and to make
comparisons with existing alternatives.
