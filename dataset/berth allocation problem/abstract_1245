This paper presents a comparison of OpenMP and OpenCL based on the parallel
implementation of algorithms from various fields of computer applications. The
focus of our study is on the performance of benchmark comparing OpenMP and
OpenCL. We observed that OpenCL programming model is a good option for mapping
threads on different processing cores. Balancing all available cores and
allocating sufficient amount of work among all computing units, can lead to
improved performance. In our simulation, we used Fedora operating system; a
system with Intel Xeon Dual core processor having thread count 24 coupled with
NVIDIA Quadro FX 3800 as graphical processing unit.
