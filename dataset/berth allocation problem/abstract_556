Up-and-Down (U&D) is a popular sequential design for estimating threshold
percentiles in binary experiments. However, U&D application practices have
stagnated, and significant gaps in understanding its properties persist. The
first part of my work aims to fill gaps in U&D theory. New results concerning
stationary distribution properties are proven. A second focus of this study is
nonparametric U&D estimation. An improvement to isotonic regression called
"centered isotonic regression" (CIR), and a new averaging estimator called
"auto-detect" are introduced and their properties studied. Bayesian
percentile-finding designs, most notably the continual reassessment method
(CRM) developed for Phase I clinical trials, are also studied. In general, CRM
convergence depends upon random run-time conditions -- meaning that convergence
is not always assured. Small-sample behavior is studied as well. It is shown
that CRM is quite sensitive to outlier sub-sequences of thresholds, resulting
in highly variable small-sample behavior between runs under identical
conditions. Nonparametric CRM variants exhibit a similar sensitivity. Ideas to
combine the advantages of U&D and Bayesian designs are examined. A new approach
is developed, using a hybrid framework, that evaluates the evidence for
overriding the U&D allocation with a Bayesian one.
