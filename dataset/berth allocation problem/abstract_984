The h-index can be used as a predictor of itself. However, the evolution of
the h-index with time is shown in the present investigation to be dominated for

scientific achievements. This inert behaviour of the h-index raises questions,
whether the h-index can be used profitably in academic appointment processes or
for the allocation of research resources.
