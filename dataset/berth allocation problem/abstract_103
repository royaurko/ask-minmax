Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be equipped with multiple heterogeneous
network interfaces. An overwhelmingly large amount of services may demand some
or all of these interfaces' available resources. Herein, we present a precise
mathematical formulation of assigning services to interfaces with heterogeneous
resources in one or more rounds. For reasonable instance sizes, the presented
formulation produces optimal solutions for this computationally hard problem.
We prove the NP-Completeness of the problem and develop two algorithms to
approximate the optimal solution for big instance sizes. The first algorithm
allocates the most demanding service requirements first, considering the
average cost of interfaces resources. The second one calculates the demanding
resource shares and allocates first the most demanding of them by choosing
randomly among equally demanding shares. Finally, we provide simulation results
giving insight into services splitting over different interfaces for both
cases.
