With the exponentially increasing demand for wireless communications the
capacity of current cellular systems will soon become incapable of handling the
growing traffic. Since radio frequencies are diminishing natural resources,
there seems to be a fundamental barrier to further capacity increase. The
solution can be found by using smart antenna systems. Smart or adaptive antenna
arrays consist of an array of antenna elements with signal processing
capability that optimizes the radiation and reception of a desired signal,
dynamically. Smart antenna can place nulls in the direction of interferers via
adapting adaptive updating of weights linked to each antenna element. They thus
cancel out most of the cochannel interference resulting in better quality of
reception and lower dropped calls. Smart antenna can also track the user within
a cell via direction of arrival algorithms. This paper focuses on about the
smart antenna in hierarchical cell clustering (overlay-underlay) with demand
based frequency allocation techniques in cellular mobile radio networks in
