This paper presents an applicability analysis over a novel integer
programming model devoted to optimize power consumption efficiency in
heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. This model is based upon a schedule of
sensor allocation plans in multiple time intervals subject to coverage and
connectivity constraints. By turning off a specific set of redundant sensors in
each time interval, it is possible to reduce the total energy consumption in
the network and, at the same time, avoid partitioning the whole network by
losing some strategic sensors too prematurely. Since the network is
heterogeneous, sensors can sense different phenomena from different demand
points, with different sample rates. As the problem instances grows the time
spent to the execution turns impracticable.
