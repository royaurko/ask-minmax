Given an undirected, edge-weighted graph G together with pairs of vertices,
called pairs of terminals, the minimum multicut problem asks for a
minimum-weight set of edges such that, after deleting these edges, the two
terminals of each pair belong to different connected components of the graph.
Relying on topological techniques, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for
this problem in the case where G is embedded on a fixed surface of genus g
(e.g., when G is planar) and has a fixed number t of terminals. The running
time is a polynomial of degree O(sqrt{g^2+gt}) in the input size.
  In the planar case, our result corrects an error in an extended abstract by
Bentz [Int. Workshop on Parameterized and Exact Computation, 109-119, 2012].
The minimum multicut problem is also a generalization of the multiway cut
problem, a.k.a. multiterminal cut problem; even for this special case, no
dedicated algorithm was known for graphs embedded on surfaces.
