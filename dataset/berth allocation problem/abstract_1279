In this paper, we consider multiple channels and wireless nodes with multiple
transceivers. Each node assigns one transmitter at each available channel. For
each assigned transmitter the node decides the power level and data rate of
transmission in a distributed fashion, such that certain Quality of Service
(QoS) demands for the wireless node are satisfied. More specifically, we
investigate the case in which the average SINR over all channels for each
communication pair is kept above a certain threshold. A joint distributed power
and rate control algorithm for each transmitter is proposed that dynamically
adjusts the data rate to meet a target SINR at each channel, and to update the
power levels allowing for variable desired SINRs. The algorithm is fully
distributed and requires only local interference measurements. The performance
of the proposed algorithm is shown through illustrative examples.
