Incorporating fairness criteria in optimization problems comes at a certain
cost, which is measured by the so-called price of fairness. Here we consider
the allocation of indivisible goods. For envy-freeness as fairness criterion it
is known from literature that the price of fairness can increase linearly in
terms of the number of agents. For the constructive lower bound a quadratic
number of items was used. In practice this might be inadequately large. So we
introduce the price of fairness in terms of both the number of agents and
items, i.e., key parameters which generally may be considered as common and
available knowledge. It turned out that the price of fairness increases
sublinear if the number of items is not too much larger than the number of
agents. For the special case of coincide of both counts exact asymptotics could
be determined. Additionally an efficient integer programming formulation is
given.
