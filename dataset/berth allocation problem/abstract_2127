We consider the relation of the multi-component 2D Toda hierarchy with matrix
orthogonal and biorthogonal polynomials. The multi-graded Hankel reduction of
this hierarchy is considered and the corresponding generalized matrix
orthogonal polynomials are studied. In particular for these polynomials we
consider the recursion relations, and for rank one weights its relation with
multiple orthogonal polynomials of mixed type with a type II normalization and
the corresponding link with a Riemann--Hilbert problem.
