This contribution presents a method of obtaining the optimal power and
subcarrier allocations that maximize the energy-efficiency (EE) of a
multi-user, multi-relay, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
cellular network. Initially, the objective function (OF) is formulated as the
ratio of the spectral-efficiency (SE) over the power consumption of the
network. This OF is shown to be quasi-concave, thus Dinkelbach's method can be
employed for solving it as a series of parameterized concave problems. We
characterize the performance of the aforementioned method by comparing the
optimal solutions obtained to those found using an exhaustive search.
Additionally, we explore the relationship between the achievable SE and EE in
the cellular network upon increasing the number of active users. In general,
increasing the number of users supported by the system benefits both the SE and
EE, and higher SE values may be obtained at the cost of EE, when an increased
power may be allocated.
