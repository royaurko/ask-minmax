This contribution presents a new approach for allocating suitable
function-implementation variants depending on given quality-of-service
function-requirements for run-time reconfigurable multi-device systems. Our
approach adapts methodologies from the domain of knowledge-based systems which
can be used for doing run-time hardware/software resource usage optimizations.
