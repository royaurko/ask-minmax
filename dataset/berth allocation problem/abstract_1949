We use discrete analogs of Riemann-Hilbert problem's methods to derive the
discrete Bessel kernel which describes the poissonized Plancherel measures for
symmetric groups. To do this we define discrete analogs of a Riemann-Hilbert
problem and of an integrable integral operator and show that computing the
resolvent of a discrete integrable operator can be reduced to solving a
corresponding discrete Riemann-Hilbert problem.
  We also give an example, explicitly solvable in terms of classical special
functions, when a discrete Riemann-Hilbert problem converges in a certain
scaling limit to a conventional one; the example originates from the
representation theory of the infinite symmetric group.
