We consider a stochastic version of the well-known Blotto game, called the
gladiator game. In this zero-sum allocation game two teams of gladiators engage
in a sequence of one-to-one fights in which the probability of winning is a
function of the gladiators' strengths. Each team's strategy consists of the
allocation of its total strength among its gladiators. We find the Nash
equilibria and the value of this class of games and show how they depend on the
total strength of teams and the number of gladiators in each team. To do this,
we study interesting majorization-type probability inequalities concerning
linear combinations of Gamma random variables. Similar inequalities have been
used in models of telecommunications and research and development.
