High precision analytical approximation is proposed for variance-covariance
based risk allocation in a portfolio of risky assets. A general case of a
single-period multi-factor Merton-type model with stochastic recovery is
considered. The accuracy of the approximation as well as its speed are compared
to and shown to be superior to those of Monte Carlo simulation.
