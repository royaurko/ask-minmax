Algorithms, policies, and methodologies are necessary to achieve high user
satisfaction and practical utilization in cloud computing by ensuring the
efficient and fair allocation of every computing resource. Whenever a new job
arrives in cloud environments, the service broker is responsible for selecting
the data center that will execute that job. Selecting data centers serves an
important function in enhancing the performance of a cloud environment. This
study proposes a new service broker policy for large-scale cloud applications
based on the round-robin algorithm. The proposed policy is implemented and
evaluated using a CloudAnalyst simulator. It is then compared with three
existing policies in terms of overall average response time by using different
virtual machine load balancing algorithms. Simulation results show that the
proposed policy improves the overall average response time relative to that of
the other policies.
