It is today accepted that matrix factorization models allow a high quality of
rating prediction in recommender systems. However, a major drawback of matrix
factorization is its static nature that results in a progressive declining of
the accuracy of the predictions after each factorization. This is due to the
fact that the new obtained ratings are not taken into account until a new
factorization is computed, which can not be done very often because of the high
cost of matrix factorization.
  In this paper, aiming at improving the accuracy of recommender systems, we
propose a cluster-based matrix factorization technique that enables online
integration of new ratings. Thus, we significantly enhance the obtained
predictions between two matrix factorizations. We use finer-grained user biases
by clustering similar items into groups, and allocating in these groups a bias
to each user. The experiments we did on large datasets demonstrated the
efficiency of our approach.
