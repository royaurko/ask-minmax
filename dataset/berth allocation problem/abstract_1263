Nowadays, the High Performance Computing is part of the context of embedded
systems. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are more and more used in
acceleration of the most part of algorithms and applications. Over the past
years, not many efforts have been done to describe abstractions of applications
in relation to their target architectures. Thus, when developers need to
associate applications and GPUs, for example, they find difficulty and prefer
using API for these architectures. This paper presents a metamodel extension
for MARTE profile and a model for GPU architectures. The main goal is to
specify the task and data allocation in the memory hierarchy of these
architectures. The results show that this approach will help to generate code
for GPUs based on model transformations using Model Driven Engineering (MDE).
