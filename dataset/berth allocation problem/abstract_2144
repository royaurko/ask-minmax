In this paper, we present a fast and accurate numerical scheme for the
solution of fifth-order boundary-value problems. We apply the reproducing
kernel Hilbert space method (RKHSM) for solving this problem. The analytic
results of the equations have been obtained in terms of convergent series with
easily computable components. We compare our results with spline methods,
decomposition method, variational iteration method, Sinc-Galerkin method and
homotopy perturbation methods. The comparison of the results with exact ones is
made to confirm the validity and efficiency.
