We consider the problem of allocating indivisible goods using the leading
notion of fairness in economics: the competitive equilibrium from equal
incomes. Focusing on two major classes of valuations, namely perfect
substitutes and perfect complements, we establish the computational properties
of algorithms operating in this framework. For the class of valuations with
perfect complements, our algorithm yields a surprisingly succinct
characterization of instances that admit a competitive equilibrium from equal
incomes.
