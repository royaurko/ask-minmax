In this paper, we consider the problem of resource allocation among two
competing users sharing a binary symmetric broadcast channel. We model the
interaction between autonomous selfish users in the resource allocation and
analyze their strategic behavior in manipulating the allocation outcome. We
analytically show that users will improve their performance (i.e. gain higher
allocated rates) if they have more information about the strategy of the
competing user.
