The generalized Busemann-Petty problem asks whether origin-symmetric convex
bodies with lower-dimensional smaller sections necessarily have smaller volume.
We study the weighted version of this problem corresponding to the physical
situation when bodies are endowed with mass distribution and the relevant
sections are measured with attenuation.
