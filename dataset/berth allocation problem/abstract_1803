The lecture, given at the ICM 2014 in Seoul, explores several problems of
analytic number theory in the context of function fields over a finite field,
where they can be approached by methods different than those of traditional
analytic number theory. The resulting theorems can be used to check existing
conjectures over the integers, and to generate new ones. Among the problems
discussed are: Counting primes in short intervals and in arithmetic
progressions; Chowla's conjecture on the autocorrelation of the Mobius
function; and the additive divisor problem.
