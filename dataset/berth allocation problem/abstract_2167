This case for the Transformation Tool Contest 2013 is about evaluating the
scope and usability of transformation languages and tools for a set of four
tasks requiring very different capabilities. One task deals with typical
model-to-model transformation problem, there's a model-to-text problem, there
are two in-place transformation problems, and finally there's a task dealing
with validation of models resulting from the transformations.
  The tasks build upon each other, but the transformation case project also
provides all intermediate models, thus making it possible to skip tasks that
are not suited for a particular tool, or for parallelizing the work among
members of participating teams.
