In this letter, an exact performance analysis is presented on the sum rate of
zero-forcing beamforming with a greedy user scheduling algorithm in a downlink
system. Adopting water-filling power allocation, we derive a compact form for
the joint probability density function of the scheduled users' squared
subchannel gains when a transmitter with multiple antennas sends information to
at most two scheduled users with each having a single antenna. The analysis is
verified by numerical results.
