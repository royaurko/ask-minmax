The 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO (2SLAQ) survey is a new survey of distant Luminous
Red Galaxies (LRGs) and faint quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) multi-color photometric data and spectroscopically observed using
the 2dF instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). In total, the 2SLAQ
survey has measured over 11000 LRG redshifts, covering 180deg^2 of SDSS imaging
data, from 87 allocated nights of AAT time. Over 90% of these galaxies are
within the range 0.45<z<0.7 and have luminosities consistent with >=3L*. When
combined with the lower redshift SDSS LRGs, the evolution in the luminosity
function of these LRGs is fully consistent with that expected from a simple
passive (luminosity) evolution model. This observation suggests that at least
half of the LRGs seen at z~0.2 must already have more than half their stellar
mass in place by z~0.6, i.e., our observations are inconsistent with a majority
of LRGs experiencing a major merger in the last 6 Gyrs. However, some
"frosting" (i.e., minor mergers) has taken place with ~5% of LRGs showing some
evidence of recent and/or on-going star-formation, but it only contributes ~1%
of their stellar mass.
