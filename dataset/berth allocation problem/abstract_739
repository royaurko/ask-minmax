Base station cooperation can exploit knowledge of the users' channel state
information (CSI) at the transmitters to manage co-channel interference. Users
have to feedback CSI of the desired and interfering channels using
finite-bandwidth backhaul links. Existing codebook designs for single-cell
limited feedback can be used for multicell cooperation by partitioning the
available feedback resources between the multiple channels. In this paper, a
new feedback-bit allocation strategy is proposed, as a function of the delays
in the communication links and received signal strengths in the downlink.
Channel temporal correlation is modeled as a function of delay using the
Gauss-Markov model. Closed-form expressions for bit partitions are derived to
allocate more bits to quantize the stronger channels with smaller delays and
fewer bits to weaker channels with larger delays, assuming random vector
quantization. Cellular network simulations are used to show that the proposed
algorithm yields higher sum-rates than an equal-bit allocation technique.
