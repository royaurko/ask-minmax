Many observations of pedestrian dynamics, including various self-organization
phenomena, have been reproduced successfully by different models. But the
empirical databases for quantitative calibration are still insufficient, e.g.
the fundamental diagram as one of the most important relationships displays
non-negligible differences among various studies. To improve this situation,
experiments in straight corridors and T-junction are performed. Four different
measurement methods are defined to study their effects on the fundamental
diagram. It is shown that they have minor influences for {\rho} <3.5 m-2 but
only the Voronoi method is able to resolve the fine-structure of the
fundamental diagram. This enhanced measurement method permits to observe the
occurrence of boundary-induced phase transition. For corridors of different
widths we found that the specific flow concept works well for {\rho} <3.5 m-2.
Moreover, we illustrate the discrepancies between the fundamental diagrams of a
T-junction and a straight corridor.
