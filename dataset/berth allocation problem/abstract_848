In this paper we study the Poisson process over a $\sigma$-finite
measure-space equipped with a measure preserving transformation or a group of
measure preserving transformations. For a measure-preserving transformation $T$
acting on a $\sigma$-finite measure-space $X$, the Poisson suspension of $T$ is
the associated probability preserving transformation $T_*$ which acts on
realization of the Poisson process over $X$. We prove ergodicity of the
Poisson-product $T\times T_*$ under the assumption that $T$ is ergodic and
conservative. We then show, assuming ergodicity of $T\times T_*$, that it is
impossible to deterministically perform natural equivariant operations:
thinning, allocation or matching. In contrast, there are well-known results in
the literature demonstrating the existence of isometry equivariant thinning,
matching and allocation of homogenous Poisson processes on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We
also prove ergodicity of the "first return of left-most transformation"
associated with a measure preserving transformation on $\mathbb{R}_+$, and
discuss ergodicity of the Poisson-product of measure preserving group actions,
and related spectral properties.
