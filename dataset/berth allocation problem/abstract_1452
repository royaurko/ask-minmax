New and novel way for resources allocation in wireless communication has been
proposed in this paper. Under this new method, it has been shown that the
required power budget becomes independent of the number of served terminals in
the downlink. However, the required power depends only of the coverage area,
i.e. the channel losses at the cell boarder. Therefore, huge number
(theoretically any number) of terminals could be supported concurrently at
finite and small downlink power budget. This could be very useful to support
the downlink signalling channels in HSPA+, LTE, and 5G. It can be very useful
also to support huge D2D communication downlinks. Moreover, and based on the
same concept, a new system configuration for a single link point-to-point
communication has been presented. With this new configuration, the achieved
data rate becomes independent of the required transmit power. This means that
any data rate can be achieved at the target BER and with small and finite
transmit power. This seems violating with some major results of the Shannon
theorem. This issue will be discussed in details in this article.
