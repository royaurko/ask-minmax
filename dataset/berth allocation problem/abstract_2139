Traditional boundary integral methods suffer from the singularity of Green's
kernels. The paper develops, for a model problem of 2D scattering as an
illustrative example, singularity-free boundary difference equations. Instead
of converting Maxwell's system into an integral boundary form first and
discretizing second, here the differential equations are first discretized on a
regular grid and then converted to boundary difference equations. The procedure
involves nonsingular Green's functions on a lattice rather than their singular
continuous counterparts. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness,
accuracy and convergence of the method. It can be generalized to 3D problems
and to other classes of linear problems, including acoustics and elasticity.
