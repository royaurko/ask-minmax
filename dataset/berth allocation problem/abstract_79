It is demonstrated how dynamic storage allocation algorithms can be analyzed
in terms of finite size scaling. The method is illustrated in the three simple
cases of the it first-fit, next-fit and it best-fit algorithms, and the system
works at full capacity. The analysis is done from two different points of view
- running speed and employed memory. In both cases, and for all algorithms, it
is shown that a simple scaling function exists and the relevant exponents are
calculated. The method can be applied on similar problems as well.
