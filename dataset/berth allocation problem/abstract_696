This paper investigates the performance of relay networks in the presence of
hybrid automatic repeat request (ARQ) feedback and adaptive power allocation.
The throughput and the outage probability of different hybrid ARQ protocols are
studied for independent and spatially-correlated fading channels. The results
are obtained for the cases where there is a sum power constraint on the source
and the relay or when each of the source and the relay are power-limited
individually. With adaptive power allocation, the results demonstrate the
efficiency of relay-ARQ techniques in different conditions.
