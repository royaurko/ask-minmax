Most Web page classification models typically apply the bag of words (BOW)
model to represent the feature space. The original BOW representation, however,
is unable to recognize semantic relationships between terms. One possible
solution is to apply the topic model approach based on the Latent Dirichlet
Allocation algorithm to cluster the term features into a set of latent topics.
Terms assigned into the same topic are semantically related. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical classification method based on a topic model and
by integrating additional term features from neighboring pages. Our
hierarchical classification method consists of two phases: (1) feature
representation by using a topic model and integrating neighboring pages, and
(2) hierarchical Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification model constructed
from a confusion matrix. From the experimental results, the approach of using
the proposed hierarchical SVM model by integrating current page with
neighboring pages via the topic model yielded the best performance with the
accuracy equal to 90.33% and the F1 measure of 90.14%; an improvement of 5.12%
and 5.13% over the original SVM model, respectively.
