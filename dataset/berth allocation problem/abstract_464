We consider the problem of finding the minimum sum-rate strategy in
cooperative data exchange systems that do not allow packet-splitting (NPS-CDE).
In an NPS-CDE system, there are a number of geographically close cooperative
clients who send packets to help the others recover a packet set. A minimum
sum-rate strategy is the strategy that achieves universal recovery (the
situation when all the clients recover the whole packet set) with the the
minimal sum-rate (the total number of transmissions). We propose an iterative
merging (IM) algorithm that recursively merges client sets based on a lower
estimate of the minimum sum-rate and updates to the value of the minimum
sum-rate. We also show that a minimum sum-rate strategy can be learned by
allocating rates for the local recovery in each merged client set in the IM
algorithm. We run an experiment to show that the complexity of the IM algorithm
is lower than that of the existing deterministic algorithm when the number of
clients is lower than $94$.
