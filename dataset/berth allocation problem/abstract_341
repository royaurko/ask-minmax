In this paper we consider the compact plane sets known as Swiss cheese sets,
which are a useful source of examples in the theory of uniform algebras and
rational approximation. We introduce a notion of 'allocation map' connected
with Swiss cheeses, and we develop the theory of such maps. We use this theory
to modify examples previously constructed in the literature to solve various
problems, in order to obtain examples of Swiss cheese sets homeomorphic to the
Sierpinski carpet which solve the same problems. In particular, this allows us
to give examples of essential, regular uniform algebras on locally connected,
compact plane sets. Our techniques also allow us to avoid certain technical
difficulties in the literature.
