This paper studies a spectrum sharing scenario between a cooperative relay
network (CRN) and a nearby ad-hoc network. In particular, we consider a dynamic
spectrum access and resource allocation problem of the CRN. Based on sensing
and predicting the ad-hoc transmission behaviors, the ergodic traffic collision
time between the CRN and ad-hoc network is minimized subject to an ergodic
uplink throughput requirement for the CRN. We focus on real-time implementation
of spectrum sharing policy under practical computation and signaling
limitations. In our spectrum sharing policy, most computation tasks are
accomplished off-line. Hence, little real-time calculation is required which
fits the requirement of practical applications. Moreover, the signaling
procedure and computation process are designed carefully to reduce the time
delay between spectrum sensing and data transmission, which is crucial for
enhancing the accuracy of traffic prediction and improving the performance of
interference mitigation. The benefits of spectrum sensing and cooperative relay
techniques are demonstrated by our numerical experiments.
