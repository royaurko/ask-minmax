The history of science reveals that major discoveries are not predictable.
Naively, one might conclude therefore that it is not possible to artificially
cultivate an environment that promotes discoveries. I suggest instead that open
research without a programmatic agenda establishes a fertile ground for
unexpected breakthroughs. Contrary to current practice, funding agencies should
allocate a small fraction of their funds to support research in centers of
excellence without programmatic reins tied to specific goals.
