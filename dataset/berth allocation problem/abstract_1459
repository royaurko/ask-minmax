Active machine learning seeks out data samples that are estimated to be
maximally informative with an aim to requiring fewer data samples overall in
order to achieve successful learning. We apply active machine learning
techniques to a novel adaptive clinical trial design in which only patients
that are expected to provide sufficient statistical information are recruited.
Allocation to a treatment arm is also done in an optimal manner. The proposed
design is a type of stream-based selective sampling where candidate patients
form a stream of data points. This work builds on previous selective
recruitment designs by applying the approach to binary outcomes and developing
four methods for evaluating the informativeness of a patient based on
uncertainty sampling, the posterior entropy, the expected generalisation error
and variance reduction. The proposed design can be extended to any type of
stream-based active learning. We examine the performance of these methods using
both experimental data and numerical simulations and illustrate that selective
recruitment designs can achieve statistically significant results using fewer
recruits than randomised trials thus offering both economic and ethical
advantages.
