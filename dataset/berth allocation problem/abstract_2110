Isotropic oscillator on a plane is discussed where both the coordinate and
momentum space are considered to be noncommutative. We also discuss the
symmetry properties of the oscillator for three separate cases when both the
noncommutative parameters \Theta and \bar{\Theta} satisfy specific relations.
We compare the Landau problem with the isotropic oscillator on noncommutative
space and obtain a relation between the two noncommutative parameters with the
magnetic field of the Landau problem.
