Nowadays digital services, such as cloud computing and network access
services, allow dynamic resource allocation and virtual resource isolation.
This trend can create a new paradigm of flexible pricing schemes. A simple
pricing scheme is to allocate multiple isolated service classes with
differentiated prices, namely Paris Metro Pricing (PMP). The benefits of PMP
are its simplicity and applicability to a wide variety of general digital
services, without considering specific performance guarantees for different
service classes. The central issue of our study is whether PMP is economically
viable, namely whether it will produce more profit for the service provider and
whether it will achieve more social welfare. Prior studies had only considered
specific models and arrived at conflicting conclusions. In this article, we
identify unifying principles in a general setting and derive general sufficient
conditions that can guarantee the viability of PMP. We further apply the
results to analyze various examples of digital services.
