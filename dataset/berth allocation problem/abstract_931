We discuss implications of the fundamental plane parameters of clusters of
galaxies derived from combined optical and X-ray data of a sample of 78 nearby
clusters. In particular, we investigate the dependence of these parameters on
the dynamical state of the cluster. We introduce a new concept of allocation of
the fundamental plane of clusters derived from their intrinsic morphological
properties, and put some theoretical implications of the existence of a
fundamental plane into perspective.
