With high scalability, high video streaming quality, and low bandwidth
requirement, peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have become a popular way to exchange
files and deliver multimedia content over the internet. However, current P2P
systems are suffering from "free-riding" due to the peers' selfish nature. In
this paper, we propose a credit-based incentive mechanism to encourage peers to
cooperate with each other in a heterogeneous network consisting of wired and
wireless peers. The proposed mechanism can provide differentiated service to
peers with different credits through biased resource allocation. A Stackelberg
game is formulated to obtain the optimal pricing and purchasing strategies,
which can jointly maximize the revenue of the uploader and the utilities of the
downloaders. In particular, peers' heterogeneity and selfish nature are taken
into consideration when designing the utility functions for the Stackelberg
game. It is shown that the proposed resource allocation scheme is effective in
providing service differentiation for peers and stimulating them to make
contribution to the P2P streaming system.
