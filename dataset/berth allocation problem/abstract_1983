The finiteness problem for automaton groups and semigroups has been widely
studied, several partial positive results are known. However we prove that, in
the most general case, the problem is undecidable. We study the case of
automaton semigroups. Given a NW-deterministic Wang tile set, we construct an
Mealy automaton, such that the plane admit a valid Wang tiling if and only if
the Mealy automaton generates a finite semigroup. The construction is similar
to a construction by Kari for proving that the nilpotency problem for cellular
automata is unsolvable. Moreover Kari proves that the tiling of the plane is
undecidable for NW-deterministic Wang tile set. It follows that the finiteness
problem for automaton semigroup is undecidable.
