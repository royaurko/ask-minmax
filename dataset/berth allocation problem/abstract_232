We consider the assignment problem in which agents express ordinal
preferences over $m$ objects and the objects are allocated to the agents based
on the preferences. In a recent paper, Brams, Kilgour, and Klamler (2014)
presented the AL method to compute an envy-free assignment for two agents. The
AL method crucially depends on the assumption that agents have strict
preferences over objects. We generalize the AL method to the case where agents
may express indifferences and prove the axiomatic properties satisfied by the
algorithm. As a result of the generalization, we also get a $O(m)$ speedup on
previous algorithms to check whether a complete envy-free assignment exists or
not. Finally, we show that unless P=NP, there can be no polynomial-time
extension of GAL to the case of arbitrary number of agents.
