The read channel in Flash memory systems degrades over time because the
Fowler-Nordheim tunneling used to apply charge to the floating gate eventually
compromises the integrity of the cell because of tunnel oxide degradation.
While degradation is commonly measured in the number of program/erase cycles
experienced by a cell, the degradation is proportional to the number of
electrons forced into the floating gate and later released by the erasing
process. By managing the amount of charge written to the floating gate to
maintain a constant read-channel mutual information, Flash lifetime can be
extended. This paper proposes an overall system approach based on information
theory to extend the lifetime of a flash memory device. Using the instantaneous
storage capacity of a noisy flash memory channel, our approach allocates the
read voltage of flash cell dynamically as it wears out gradually over time. A
practical estimation of the instantaneous capacity is also proposed based on
soft information via multiple reads of the memory cells.
