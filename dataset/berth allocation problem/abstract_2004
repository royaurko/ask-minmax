Joint approximate diagonalization of non-commuting symmetric matrices is an
important process in independent component analysis. It is known that this
problem can be formulated as an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold.
Riemannian optimization techniques can be used to solve this optimization
problem. Among the available techniques, this article provides Riemannian
Newton's method for the joint diagonalization problem, which has the quadratic
convergence property. In particular, it is shown that the resultant Newton's
equation can be effectively solved by means of the Kronecker product and vec
operator, which reduces the dimension of the equation. Numerical experiments
are performed to show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of an
approximate solution of the problem.
