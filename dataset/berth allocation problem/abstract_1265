We examine properties of a model of resource allocation in which several
agents exchange resources in order to optimise their individual holdings. The
schemes discussed relate to well-known negotiation protocols proposed in
earlier work and we consider a number of alternative notions of rationality
covering both quantitative measures, e.g. cooperative and individual
rationality and more qualitative forms, e.g. Pigou-Dalton transfers. While it
is known that imposing particular rationality and structural restrictions may
result in some reallocations of the resource set becoming unrealisable, in this
paper we address the issue of the number of restricted rational deals that may
be required to implement a particular reallocation when it is possible to do
so. We construct examples showing that this number may be exponential (in the
number of resources m), even when all of the agent utility functions are
monotonic. We further show that k agents may achieve in a single deal a
reallocation requiring exponentially many rational deals if at most k-1 agents
can participate, this same reallocation being unrealisable by any sequences of
rational deals in which at most k-2 agents are involved.
