We introduce and formulate two types of random-walk domination problems in
graphs motivated by a number of applications in practice (e.g., item-placement
problem in online social network, Ads-placement problem in advertisement
networks, and resource-placement problem in P2P networks). Specifically, given
a graph $G$, the goal of the first type of random-walk domination problem is to
target $k$ nodes such that the total hitting time of an $L$-length random walk
starting from the remaining nodes to the targeted nodes is minimal. The second
type of random-walk domination problem is to find $k$ nodes to maximize the
expected number of nodes that hit any one targeted node through an $L$-length
random walk. We prove that these problems are two special instances of the
submodular set function maximization with cardinality constraint problem. To
solve them effectively, we propose a dynamic-programming (DP) based greedy
algorithm which is with near-optimal performance guarantee. The DP-based greedy
algorithm, however, is not very efficient due to the expensive marginal gain
evaluation. To further speed up the algorithm, we propose an approximate greedy
algorithm with linear time complexity w.r.t.\ the graph size and also with
near-optimal performance guarantee. The approximate greedy algorithm is based
on a carefully designed random-walk sampling and sample-materialization
techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and
scalability of the proposed algorithms.
