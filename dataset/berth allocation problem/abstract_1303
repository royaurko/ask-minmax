Despite the conclusive potential of cognitive radio for provisioning the
dynamic and flexible spectrum/channel allocation, the research community should
study the performance gain of physical layer over such a radio with cognition
capabilities. To this end, several mechanisms of physical layers such as
adaptive modulation, multiple-input multiple output antennas; channel coding
and/or combination of them should be studied. These studies should be
accomplished in terms of spectral efficiency. Therefore, the gain of cognitive
radio in wireless networks available into the market will be identified
practically. Another issue under consideration should be the performance
evaluation of cognitive radio assuming a cross-layer combination between the
cognitive physical and the upper layers. To this direction, this paper presents
a study on spectral efficiency at the physical layer with cognitive
capabilities. In sequel, we study a cross-layer combination of physical layer
with upper layers in the same cognitive context. The performance gain of
cognitive radio in such a physical layer is realized practically as well as a
few cross-layer design issues have been raised.
