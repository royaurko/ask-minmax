This letter considers waveform design of orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) signal for radar applications, and aims at mitigating the
envelope fluctuation in OFDM. A novel method is proposed to reduce the
peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR), which is commonly used to evaluate
the fluctuation. The proposed method is based on the tone reservation approach,
in which some bits or subcarriers of OFDM are allocated for decreasing PMEPR.
We introduce the coefficient of variation of envelopes (CVE) as the cost
function for waveform optimization, and develop an iterative least squares
algorithm. Minimizing CVE leads to distinct PMEPR reduction, and it is
guaranteed that the cost function monotonically decreases by applying the
iterative algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that the envelope is significantly
smoothed by the proposed method.
