Virtual machine is built on group of real servers which are scattered
globally and connect together through the telecommunications systems, it has an
increasingly important role in the operation, providing the ability to exploit
virtual resources. The latest technique helps to use computing resources more
effectively and has many benefits, such as cost reduction of power, cooling
and, hence, contributes to the Green Computing. To ensure the supply of these
resources to demand processes correctly and promptly, avoiding any duplication
or conflict, especially remote resources, it is necessary to study and propose
a reliable solution appropriate to be the foundation for internal control
systems in the cloud. In the scope of this paper, we find a way to produce
efficient distributed resources which emphasizes solutions preventing deadlock
and proposing methods to avoid resource shortage issue. With this approach, the
outcome result is the checklist of re-sources state which has the possibility
of deadlock and lack of resources, by sending messages to the servers, the
server would know the situation and have corresponding reaction.
