We present a fully self-consistent simulation of a synthetic survey of the
furthermost cosmic explosions. The appearance of the first generation of stars
(Population III) in the Universe represents a critical point during cosmic
evolution, signaling the end of the dark ages, a period of absence of light
sources. Despite their importance, there is no confirmed detection of
Population III stars so far. A fraction of these primordial stars are expected
to die as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), and should be bright enough to
be observed up to a few hundred million years after the big bang. While the
quest for Population III stars continues, detailed theoretical models and
computer simulations serve as a testbed for their observability. With the
upcoming near-infrared missions, estimates of the feasibility of detecting
PISNe are not only timely but imperative. To address this problem, we combine
state-of-the-art cosmological and radiative simulations into a complete and
self-consistent framework, which includes detailed features of the
observational process. We show that a dedicated observational strategy using
$\lesssim 8$ per cent of total allocation time of the James Webb Space
Telescope mission can provide us up to $\sim 9-15$ detectable PISNe per year.
