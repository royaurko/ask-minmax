In this work we perform a numerical exploration of the families of planar
periodic orbits in the Hill's approximation in the restricted four body
problem, that is, after a symplectic scaling, two massive bodies are sent to
infinity, by mean of expanding the potential as a power series in m3^1/3, (the
mass of the third small primary) and taking the limit case when m3 tends to
zero. The limiting Hamiltonian depends on a parameter mu (the mass of the
second primary) and possesses some dynamical features from both the classical
restricted three- body problem and the restricted four-body problem. We explore
the families of periodic orbits of the infinitesimal particle for some values
of the mass pa- rameter, these explorations show interesting properties
regarding the periodic orbits for this problem, in particular for the
Sun-Jupiter-asteroid case. We also offer details on the horizontal and vertical
stability of each family.
