This paper considers the application of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
techniques to non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. A new design of
precoding and detection matrices for MIMO-NOMA is proposed and its performance
is analyzed for the case with a fixed set of power allocation coefficients. To
further improve the performance gap between MIMO-NOMA and conventional
orthogonal multiple access schemes, user pairing is applied to NOMA and its
impact on the system performance is characterized. More sophisticated choices
of power allocation coefficients are also proposed to meet various quality of
service requirements. Finally computer simulation results are provided to
facilitate the performance evaluation of MIMO-NOMA and also demonstrate the
accuracy of the developed analytical results.
