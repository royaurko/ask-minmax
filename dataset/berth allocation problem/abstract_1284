R. F. pollution has been recognized as health hazard in India in the
prevailing circumstances. There is lot of hue and cry against cellular towers
installed in residential area. Recently high court in India has issued an order
not to install towers in residential areas. For meeting the exponential demand
of cellular communication in India this will be a set back for future growth.
An appropriate solution has to be developed for meeting demand as well as RF
pollution concern of the society. This paper deals with the installation of low
power base stations in residential areas instead of high power macro cell base
stations. Macro stations are proposed to be used for fast traffic, low power
micro cell for a slow traffic / pedestrian and pico cell / femto cell for
indoor use. These cells will be in hierarchical structure along with adaptive
frequency allocation techniques and A-SDMA approach.
