The \textsc{Bipartite Contraction} problem is to decide, given a graph $G$
and a parameter $k$, whether we can can obtain a bipartite graph from $G$ by at
most $k$ edge contractions. The fixed-parameter tractability of the problem was
shown by [Heggernes et al. 2011], with an algorithm whose running time has
double-exponential dependence on $k$. We present a new randomized FPT algorithm
for the problem, which is both conceptually simpler and achieves an improved
$2^{O(k^2)} n m$ running time, i.e., avoiding the double-exponential dependence
on $k$. The algorithm can be derandomized using standard techniques.
