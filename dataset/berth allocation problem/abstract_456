The Dynamic Scalability of resources, a problem in Infrastructure as a
Service (IaaS) has been the hotspot for research and industry communities. The
heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the Cloud workloads depends on the Quality
of Service (QoS) allocation of appropriate workloads to appropriate resources.
A workload is an abstraction of work that instance or set of instances that are
going to perform. Running a web service or being a Hadoop data node is valid
workloads. The efficient management of dynamic nature resources can be done
with the help of workloads. Until workload is considered a fundamental
capability, the Cloud resources cannot be utilized in an efficient manner. In
this paper, different workloads have been identified and categorized along with
their characteristics and constraints. The metrics based on Quality of Service
(QoS) requirements have been identified for each workload and have been
analyzed for creating better application design.
