We consider D-optimal designs with ordered categorical responses and
cumulative link models. In addition to theoretically characterizing locally
D-optimal designs, we develop efficient algorithms for obtaining both
approximate designs and exact designs. For ordinal data and general link
functions, we obtain a simplified structure of the Fisher information matrix,
and express its determinant as a homogeneous polynomial. For a predetermined
set of design points, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for an
allocation to be locally D-optimal. We prove that the number of support points
in a minimally supported design only depends on the number of predictors, which
can be much less than the number of parameters in the model. We show that a
D-optimal minimally supported allocation in this case is usually not uniform on
its support points. We also provide EW D-optimal designs as a highly efficient
surrogate to Bayesian D-optimal designs with ordinal data.
