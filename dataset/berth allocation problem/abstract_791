One of the key challenges in wireless networking is how to allocate the
available radio resources in order to maximise key service delivery parameters
such as the aggregate throughput and the multimedia quality of experience
(QoE). We propose a novel and effective scheduling policy that allocates
resource blocks, such that interference power is shifted towards
capacity-saturated users, while improving the throughput of unsaturated users.
The highlight of the research is that the proposed scheme can dramatically
improve the performance of cells that have a high discrepancy in its
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) distribution, which is typical in urban areas. The
results show that a \emph{free-lunch} solution is possible, whereby for a
negligible performance degradation in the saturated users, a large improvement
in the non-saturated users can be obtained. However, on average, the number of
free-lunch user pairings are low. By relaxing the degradation constraints, the
\emph{non-free-lunch} solution can yield a greater multi-user throughput gain.
Motivated by surge in mobile multimedia traffic, we further demonstrate that
the proposed scheduling may have a profound impact on both energy efficiency
and QoE of multimedia service delivery.
