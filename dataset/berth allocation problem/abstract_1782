Maybe the first inverse problem presented in the history of the occidental
thought is described in the book Republic, written by Plato. The problem is
posed in the Book VII in a text known as the Allegory of the Cave. That text
motivated us to formulate a simple mathematical model that simulates, in a
sense, the situation of the persons described in that problem.
