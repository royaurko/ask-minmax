The increasing demands of various high data rate wireless applications have
been seen in the recent years and it will continue in the future. To fulfill
these demands, the limited existing wireless resources should be utilized
properly or new wireless technology should be developed. Therefore, we propose
some novel idea to manage the wireless resources and deployment of
femtocellular network technology. The study was mainly divided into two parts:
(a) femtocellular network deployment and resource allocation and (b) resource
management for macrocellular networks. The femtocellular network deployment
scenarios, integrated femtocell/macrocell network architectures, cost-effective
frequency planning, and mobility management schemes are presented in first
part. In the second part, we provide a CAC based on adaptive bandwidth
allocation for the wireless network in. The proposed CAC relies on adaptive
multi-level bandwidth-allocation scheme for non-real-time calls. We propose
video service provisioning over wireless networks. We provide a QoS adaptive
radio resource allocation as well as popularity based bandwidth allocation
schemes for scalable videos over wireless cellular networks. All the proposed
schemes are verified through several numerical and simulation results. The
research results presented in this dissertation clearly imply the advantages of
our proposed schemes.
