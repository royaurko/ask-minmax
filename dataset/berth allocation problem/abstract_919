We discuss the use of the determinantal point process (DPP) as a prior for
latent structure in biomedical applications, where inference often centers on
the interpretation of latent features as biologically or clinically meaningful
structure. Typical examples include mixture models, where the terms of the
mixture are meant to represent clinically meaningful subpopulations (of
patients, genes, etc.); as well as generalizations of latent partition schemes
including feature allocation models. We discuss a class of repulsive priors on
latent mixture components and propose the DPP as an attractive prior for
feature-specific parameters, when the goal is again to interpret those as
clinically relevant structure. We illustrate the advantages of DPP priors in
three case studies, including inference in mixture models for magnetic
resonance images (MRI) and for protein expression, and a feature allocation
model for gene expression using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. An important
part of our argument is an efficient and straightforward posterior simulation
method. We implement a variation of reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo
simulation for inference under the DPP prior, using a density with respect to
the unit rate Poisson process.
