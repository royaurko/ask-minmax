Multiple antenna systems have been extensively used by standards designing
multi-gigabit communication systems operating in bandwidth of several GHz. In
this paper, we study the use of transmitter (Tx) beamforming techniques to
improve the performance of a MIMO system with a low precision ADC. We motivate
an approach to use eigenmode transmit beamforming (which imposes a diagonal
structure in the complete MIMO system) and use an eigenmode power allocation
which minimizes the uncoded BER of the finite precision system. Although we
cannot guarantee optimality of this approach, we observe that even low with
precision ADC, it performs comparably to full precision system with no
eigenmode power allocation. For example, in a high throughput MIMO system with
a finite precision ADC at the receiver, simulation results show that for a 3/4
LDPC coded 2x2 MIMO OFDM 16-QAM system with 3-bit precision ADC at the
receiver, a BER of 0.0001 is achieved at an SNR of 26 dB. This is 1 dB better
than that required for the same system with full precision but equal eigenmode
power allocation.
