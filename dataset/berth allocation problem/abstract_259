We introduce the notion of fault tolerant mechanism design, which extends the
standard game theoretic framework of mechanism design to allow for uncertainty
about execution. Specifically, we define the problem of task allocation in
which the private information of the agents is not only their costs to attempt
the tasks, but also their probabilities of failure. For several different
instances of this setting we present technical results, including positive ones
in the form of mechanisms that are incentive compatible, individually rational
and efficient, and negative ones in the form of impossibility theorems.
