Dynamic spectrum sharing approach is a paradigm shift from the conventional
static and exclusive approach to spectrum allocation. The existing
methodologies to define use of the spectrum and quantify its efficiency are
based on the static spectrum assignment paradigm and not suitable for the
dynamic spectrum sharing paradigm. There is a need to separately quantify the
spectrum consumed by the individual transmitters and receivers when multiple
heterogeneous wireless networks are sharing the spectrum in time, space, and
frequency dimensions. By discretizing the spectrum dimensions, we define a
methodology for quantifying the spectrum consumption spaces. This is an attempt
to adopt the discretized signal processing principle and apply it to spectrum
management functions that would bring in simplicity, flexibility, and precision
among other advantages.
