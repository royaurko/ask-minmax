Given a homogenous Poisson point process in the plane, we prove that it is
possible to partition the plane into bounded connected cells of equal volume,
in a translation-invariant way, with each point of the process contained in
exactly one cell. Moreover, the diameter $D$ of the cell containing the origin
satisfies the essentially optimal tail bound $P(D>r)<c/r$. We give two variants
of the construction. The first has the curious property that any two cells are
at positive distance from each other. In the second, any bounded region of the
plane intersects only finitely many cells almost surely.
