Financial institutions have to allocate so-called "economic capital" in order
to guarantee solvency to their clients and counter parties. Mathematically
speaking, any methodology of allocating capital is a "risk measure", i.e. a
function mapping random variables to the real numbers. Nowadays
"value-at-risk", which is defined as a fixed level quantile of the random
variable under consideration, is the most popular risk measure. Unfortunately,
it fails to reward diversification, as it is not "subadditive". In the search
for a suitable alternative to value-at-risk, "Expected Shortfall" (or
"conditional value-at-risk" or "tail value-at-risk") has been characterized as
the smallest "coherent" and "law invariant" risk measure to dominate
value-at-risk. We discuss these and some other properties of Expected Shortfall
as well as its generalization to a class of coherent risk measures which can
incorporate higher moment effects. Moreover, we suggest a general method on how
to attribute Expected Shortfall "risk contributions" to portfolio components.
  Key words: Expected Shortfall; Value-at-Risk; Spectral Risk Measure;
coherence; risk contribution.
