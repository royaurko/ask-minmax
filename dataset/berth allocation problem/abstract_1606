The SINR (signal to interference plus noise ratio) is a key factor for
wireless networks analysis. Indeed, the SINR distribution allows the derivation
of performance and quality of service (QoS) evaluation. Moreover, it also
enables the analysis of radio resources allocation and scheduling policies,
since they depend on the SINR reached by a UE (User Equipment). Therefore, it
is particularly interesting to develop an analytical method which allows to
evaluate the SINR, in a simple and quick way, for a realistic environment.
Considering a stochastic Poisson network model, we establish the CDF
(cumulative distributed function) of the SINR. We show that the shadowing can
be neglected, in many cases, as long as mobiles are connected to their best
serving base station (BS), i.e. the BS which offers them the most powerful
useful signal. As a consequence, the analysis of performance and quality of
service, directly derived from the CDF of SINR, can be established by using a
propagation model which takes into account only the pathloss. Moreover, we
establish that the Fluid network model we have proposed can be used to analyze
stochastic Poisson distributed network. Therefore, the analysis of stochastic
Poisson network can be done in an easy and quick way, by using the analytical
expression of the SINR established thanks to the Fluid network model.
