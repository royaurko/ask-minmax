A good organization model of multiple mobile robot should be able to improve
the efficiency of the system, reduce the complication of robot interactions,
and detract the difficulty of computation. From the sociology aspect of
topology, structure and organization, this paper studies the multiple mobile
robot organization formation and running mechanism in the dynamic, complicated
and unknown environment. It presents and describes in detail a Hierarchical-
Web Recursive Organization Model (HWROM) and forming algorithm. It defines the
robot society leader; robotic team leader and individual robot as the same
structure by the united framework and describes the organization model by the
recursive structure. The model uses task-oriented and top-down method to
dynamically build and maintain structures and organization. It uses
market-based techniques to assign task, form teams and allocate resources in
dynamic environment. The model holds several characteristics of
self-organization, dynamic, conciseness, commonness and robustness.
