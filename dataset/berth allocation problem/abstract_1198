Consider throwing $n$ balls at random into $m$ urns, each ball landing in urn
$i$ with probability $p_i$. Let $S$ be the resulting number of singletons,
i.e., urns containing just one ball. We give an error bound for the Kolmogorov
distance from $S$ to the normal, and estimates on its variance. These show that
if $n$, $m$ and $(p_i, 1 \leq i \leq m)$ vary in such a way that $\sup_i p_i =
O(n^{-1})$, then $S$ satisfies a CLT if and only if $n^2 \sum_i p_i^2$ tends to
infinity, and demonstrate an optimal rate of convergence in the CLT in this
case. In the uniform case $(p_i \equiv m^{-1}) with $m$ and $n$ growing
proportionately, we provide bounds with better asymptotic constants. The proof
of the error bounds are based on Stein's method via size-biased couplings.
