Proximity catch digraphs (PCDs) are based on proximity maps which yield
proximity regions and are special types of proximity graphs. PCDs are based on
the relative allocation of points from two or more classes in a region of
interest and have applications in various fields. In this article, we provide
auxiliary tools for and various characterizations of PCDs based on their
probabilistic behavior. We consider the cases in which the vertices of the PCDs
come from uniform and non-uniform distributions in the region of interest. We
also provide some of the newly defined proximity maps as illustrative examples.
