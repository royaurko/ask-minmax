Complementation of B\"uchi automata has been studied for over five decades
since the formalism was introduced in 1960. Known complementation constructions
can be classified into Ramsey-based, determinization-based, rank-based, and
slice-based approaches. Regarding the performance of these approaches, there
have been several complexity analyses but very few experimental results. What
especially lacks is a comparative experiment on all of the four approaches to
see how they perform in practice. In this paper, we review the four approaches,
propose several optimization heuristics, and perform comparative
experimentation on four representative constructions that are considered the
most efficient in each approach. The experimental results show that (1) the
determinization-based Safra-Piterman construction outperforms the other three
in producing smaller complements and finishing more tasks in the allocated time
and (2) the proposed heuristics substantially improve the Safra-Piterman and
the slice-based constructions.
