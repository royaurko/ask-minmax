Although modern portfolio theory has been in existence for over 60 years,
fund managers often struggle to get its models to produce reliable portfolio
allocations without strongly constraining the decision vector by tight bands of
strategic allocation targets. The two main root causes to this problem are
inadequate parameter estimation and numerical artifacts. When both obstacles
are overcome, portfolio models yield excellent allocations. In this paper,
which is primarily aimed at practitioners, we discuss the most common mistakes
in setting up portfolio models and in solving them algorithmically.
