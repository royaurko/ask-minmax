In this paper, we investigate secure and reliable transmission strategies for
multi-cell multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in
the presence of an active eavesdropper. We consider a time-division duplex
system where uplink training is required and an active eavesdropper can attack
the training phase to cause pilot contamination at the transmitter. This forces
the precoder used in the subsequent downlink transmission phase to implicitly
beamform towards the eavesdropper, thus increasing its received signal power.
We derive an asymptotic achievable secrecy rate for matched filter precoding
and artificial noise (AN) generation at the transmitter when the number of
transmit antennas goes to infinity. For the achievability scheme at hand, we
obtain the optimal power allocation policy for the transmit signal and the AN
in closed form. For the case of correlated fading channels, we show that the
impact of the active eavesdropper can be completely removed if the transmit
correlation matrices of the users and the eavesdropper are orthogonal. Inspired
by this result, we propose a precoder null space design exploiting the low rank
property of the transmit correlation matrices of massive MIMO channels, which
can significantly degrade the eavesdropping capabilities of the active
eavesdropper.
