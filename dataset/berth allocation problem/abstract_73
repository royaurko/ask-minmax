This paper addresses the problem of energy-efficient resource allocation in
the downlink of a cellular OFDMA system. Three definitions of the energy
efficiency are considered for system design, accounting for both the radiated
and the circuit power. User scheduling and power allocation are optimized
across a cluster of coordinated base stations with a constraint on the maximum
transmit power (either per subcarrier or per base station). The asymptotic
noise-limited regime is discussed as a special case. %The performance of both
an isolated and a non-isolated cluster of coordinated base stations is examined
in the numerical experiments. Results show that the maximization of the energy
efficiency is approximately equivalent to the maximization of the spectral
efficiency for small values of the maximum transmit power, while there is a
wide range of values of the maximum transmit power for which a moderate
reduction of the data rate provides a large saving in terms of dissipated
energy. Also, the performance gap among the considered resource allocation
strategies reduces as the out-of-cluster interference increases.
