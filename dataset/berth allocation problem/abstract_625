Optimal resource utilization for executing tasks within the cloud is one of
the biggest challenges. In executing the task over a cloud, the resource
provisioner is responsible for providing the resources to create virtual
machines. To utilize the resources optimally, the resource provisioner has to
take care of the process of allocating resources to Virtual Machine Manager
(VMM). In this paper, an efficient way to utilize the resources, within the
cloud, to create virtual machines has been proposed considering optimum cost
based on performance factor. This performance factor depends upon the overall
cost of the resource, communication channel cost, reliability and popularity
factor. We have proposed a framework for communication between resource owner
and cloud using Resource Cloud Communication Paradigm (RCCP). We extend the
CloudSim[2] adding provisioner policies and Efficient Resource Allocation (ERA)
algorithm in VMM allocation policy as a decision support for resource
provisioner.
