and infringe user's privacy. Even if some project uses embedded Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) into the sidewalk for blind's free walking, the tag

suggested allocation scheme of RFID tag referring to EPCglobal SGLN, tactile

accidents prevention, stress relief and satisfied factors in terms of cost and
human usability.
