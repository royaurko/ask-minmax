Complex non-linear interactions between banks and assets we model by two
time-dependent Erd\H{o}s Renyi network models where each node, representing
bank, can invest either to a single asset (model I) or multiple assets (model
II). We use dynamical network approach to evaluate the collective financial
failure---systemic risk---quantified by the fraction of active nodes. The
systemic risk can be calculated over any future time period, divided on
sub-periods, where within each sub-period banks may contiguously fail due to
links to either (i) assets or (ii) other banks, controlled by two parameters,
probability of internal failure $p$ and threshold $T_h$ ("solvency" parameter).
The systemic risk non-linearly increases with $p$ and decreases with average
network degree faster when all assets are equally distributed across banks than
if assets are randomly distributed. The more inactive banks each bank can
sustain (smaller $T_h$), the smaller the systemic risk---for some $T_h$ values
in I we report a discontinuity in systemic risk. When contiguous spreading
becomes stochastic (ii) controlled by probability $p_2$---a condition for the
bank to be solvent (active) is stochastic---the systemic risk decreases with
decreasing $p_2$. We analyse asset allocation for the U.S. banks.
