In this letter, we investigate the resource allocation for downlink
multi-cell coordinated OFDMA wireless networks, in which power allocation and
subcarrier scheduling are jointly optimized. Aiming at maximizing the weighted
sum of the minimal user rates (WSMR) of coordinated cells under individual
power constraints at each base station, an effective distributed resource
allocation algorithm using a modified decomposition method is proposed, which
is suitable by practical implementation due to its low complexity and fast
convergence speed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
decentralized algorithm provides substantial throughput gains with lower
computational cost compared to existing schemes.
