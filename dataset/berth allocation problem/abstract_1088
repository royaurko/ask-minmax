This paper describes a method for asking statistical questions about a large
text corpus. We exemplify the method by addressing the question, "What
percentage of Federal Register documents are real documents, of possible
interest to a text researcher or analyst?" We estimate an answer to this
question by evaluating 200 documents selected from a corpus of 45,820 Federal
Register documents. Stratified sampling is used to reduce the sampling
uncertainty of the estimate from over 3100 documents to fewer than 1000. The
stratification is based on observed characteristics of real documents, while
the sampling procedure incorporates a Bayesian version of Neyman allocation. A
possible application of the method is to establish baseline statistics used to
estimate recall rates for information retrieval systems.
