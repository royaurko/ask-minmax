The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will observe around 10^6 spectra from
targets distributed over an area of about 10,000 square degrees, using a
multi-object fiber spectrograph which can simultaneously observe 640 objects in
a circular field-of-view (referred to as a ``tile'') 1.49 degrees in radius. No
two fibers can be placed closer than 55'' during the same observation; multiple
targets closer than this distance are said to ``collide.'' We present here a
method of allocating fibers to desired targets given a set of tile centers
which includes the effects of collisions and which is nearly optimally
efficient and uniform. Because of large-scale structure in the galaxy
distribution (which form the bulk of the SDSS targets), a naive covering the
sky with equally-spaced tiles does not yield uniform sampling. Thus, we present
a heuristic for perturbing the centers of the tiles from the equally-spaced
distribution which provides more uniform completeness. For the SDSS sample, we
can attain a sampling rate greater than 92% for all targets, and greater than
99% for the set of targets which do not collide with each other, with an
efficiency greater than 90% (defined as the fraction of available fibers
assigned to targets).
