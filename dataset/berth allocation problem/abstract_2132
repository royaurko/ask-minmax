Given a set of coins arranged in a line, we remove heads-up coins one at a
time and flip any adjacent coins after each removal. The coin-removal problem
is to determine for which arrangements of coins it is possible to remove all of
the coins. In this paper we consider a variation of the problem in which gaps
created by removing coins are eliminated by pushing the coins together. We
characterize the set of removable arrangements and show that this set forms a
regular language. We use a finite automaton to find a recursive formula for the
number of removable arrangements of different lengths.
