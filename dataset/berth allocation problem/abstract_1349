We consider Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) systems
in correlated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Nakagami-m fading channels
with equal power allocated to each transmit antenna and also we consider that
the channel state information (CSI) is available only at the receiver. Now for
practical application, study of the VBLAST MIMO system in correlated
environment is necessary. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the
channel capacity in correlated and uncorrelated channel condition and also
validated the result with appropriate mathematical relation.
