Convection-diffusion problems arise in the modelling of many physical
processes. Their typical solutions exhibit boundary and/or interior layers.
Despite the linear nature of the differential operator, these problems pose
still-unanswered questions to the numerical analyst.
  This talk will give a selective overview of numerical methods for the
solution of convection-diffusion problems, while placing them in a historical
context. It examines the principles that underpin the competing numerical
techniques in this area and presents some recent developments.
