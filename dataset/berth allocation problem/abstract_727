This paper focuses on the cross-layer issue of resource allocation for energy
efficiency in the uplink of a multiuser MIMO wireless communication system.
Assuming that all of the transmitters and the uplink receiver are equipped with
multiple antennas, the situation considered is that in which each terminal is
allowed to vary its transmit power, beamforming vector, and uplink receiver in
order to maximize its own utility, which is defined as the ratio of data
throughput to transmit power; the case in which non-linear interference
cancellation is used at the receiver is also investigated. Applying a
game-theoretic formulation, several non-cooperative games for utility
maximization are thus formulated, and their performance is compared in terms of
achieved average utility, achieved average SINR and average transmit power at
the Nash equilibrium. Numerical results show that the use of the proposed
cross-layer resource allocation policies brings remarkable advantages to the
network performance.
