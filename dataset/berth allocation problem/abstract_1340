The analysis of markets with indivisible goods and fixed exogenous prices has
played an important role in economic models, especially in relation to wage
rigidity and unemployment. This research report provides a mathematical and
computational details associated to the mathematical programming based
approaches proposed by Nasini et al. (accepted 2014) to study pure exchange
economies where discrete amounts of commodities are exchanged at fixed prices.
Barter processes, consisting in sequences of elementary reallocations of couple
of commodities among couples of agents, are formalized as local searches
converging to equilibrium allocations. A direct application of the analyzed
processes in the context of computational economics is provided, along with a
Java implementation of the approaches described in this research report.
