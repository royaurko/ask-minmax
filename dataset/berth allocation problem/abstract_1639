The main objective of the Wide Field Monitor (WFM) on the LOFT mission is to
provide unambiguous detection of the high-energy sources in a large field of
view, in order to support science operations of the LOFT primary instrument,
the LAD. The monitor will also provide by itself a large number of results on
the timing and spectral behaviour of hundreds of galactic compact objects,
Active Galactic Nuclei and Gamma-Ray Bursts. The WFM is based on the coded
aperture concept where a position sensitive detector records the shadow of a
mask projected by the celestial sources. The proposed WFM detector plane, based
on Double Sided micro-Strip Silicon Detectors (DSSD), will allow proper
2-dimensional recording of the projected shadows. Indeed the positioning of the
photon interaction in the detector with equivalent fine resolution in both
directions insures the best imaging capability compatible with the allocated
budgets for this telescope on LOFT. We will describe here the overall
configuration of this 2D-WFM and the design and characteristics of the DSSD
detector plane including its imaging and spectral performances. We will also
present a number of simulated results discussing the advantages that this
configuration offers to LOFT. A DSSD-based WFM will in particular reduce
significantly the source confusion experienced by the WFM in crowded regions of
the sky like the Galactic Center and will in general increase the observatory
science capability of the mission.
