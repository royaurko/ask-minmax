In the causal adjustment setting, variable selection techniques based on
either the outcome or treatment allocation model can result in the omission of
confounders or the inclusion of spurious variables in the propensity score. We
propose a variable selection method based on a penalized likelihood which
considers the response and treatment assignment models simultaneously. The
proposed method facilitates confounder selection in high-dimensional settings.
We show that under some conditions our method attains the oracle property. The
selected variables are used to form a double robust regression estimator of the
treatment effect. Simulation results are presented and economic growth data are
analyzed.
