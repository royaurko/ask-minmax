We consider a finite sequence of random points in a finite domain of a
finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The points are sequentially allocated in
the domain according to a model of cooperative sequential adsorption. The main
peculiarity of the model is that the probability distribution of a point
depends on previously allocated points. We assume that the dependence vanishes
as the concentration of points tends to infinity. Under this assumption the law
of large numbers, the central limit theorem and Poisson approximation are
proved for the generated sequence of random point measures.
