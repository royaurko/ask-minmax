The value 1 problem is a decision problem for probabilistic automata over
finite words: given a probabilistic automaton, are there words accepted with
probability arbitrarily close to 1? This problem was proved undecidable
recently; to overcome this, several classes of probabilistic automata of
different nature were proposed, for which the value 1 problem has been shown
decidable. In this paper, we introduce yet another class of probabilistic
automata, called leaktight automata, which strictly subsumes all classes of
probabilistic automata whose value 1 problem is known to be decidable. We prove
that for leaktight automata, the value 1 problem is decidable (in fact,
PSPACE-complete) by constructing a saturation algorithm based on the
computation of a monoid abstracting the behaviours of the automaton. We rely on
algebraic techniques developed by Simon to prove that this abstraction is
complete. Furthermore, we adapt this saturation algorithm to decide whether an
automaton is leaktight. Finally, we show a reduction allowing to extend our
decidability results from finite words to infinite ones, implying that the
value 1 problem for probabilistic leaktight parity automata is decidable.
