A dynamical model for the distribution of resources between competing agents
is studied. While global competition leads to the accumulation of all the
resources by a single agent, local competition allows for a wider resource
distribution. Multiplicative processes give rise to almost-ordered spatial
structures, thourgh the enhancement of random fluctuations.
