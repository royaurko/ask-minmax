Cyber literacy merits serious research attention because it addresses a
confluence of specialization and generalization; cybersecurity is often
conceived of as approachable only by a technological intelligentsia, yet its
interdependent nature demands education for a broad population. Therefore,
educational tools should lead participants to discover technical knowledge in
an accessible and attractive framework. In this paper, we present Protection
and Deception (P&G), a novel two-player board game. P&G has three main
contributions. First, it builds cyber literacy by giving participants
"hands-on" experience with game pieces that have the capabilities of
cyber-attacks such as worms, masquerading attacks/spoofs, replay attacks, and
Trojans. Second, P&G teaches the important game-theoretic concepts of
asymmetric information and resource allocation implicitly and non-obtrusively
through its game play. Finally, it strives for the important objective of
security education for underrepresented minorities and people without explicit
technical experience. We tested P&G at a community center in Manhattan with
middle- and high school students, and observed enjoyment and increased cyber
literacy along with suggestions for improvement of the game. Together with
these results, our paper also presents images of the attractive board design
and 3D printed game pieces, together with a Monte-Carlo analysis that we used
to ensure a balanced gaming experience.
