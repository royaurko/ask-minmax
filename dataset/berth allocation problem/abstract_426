This work considers a computationally and statistically efficient parameter
estimation method for a wide class of latent variable models---including
Gaussian mixture models, hidden Markov models, and latent Dirichlet
allocation---which exploits a certain tensor structure in their low-order
observable moments (typically, of second- and third-order). Specifically,
parameter estimation is reduced to the problem of extracting a certain
(orthogonal) decomposition of a symmetric tensor derived from the moments; this
decomposition can be viewed as a natural generalization of the singular value
decomposition for matrices. Although tensor decompositions are generally
intractable to compute, the decomposition of these specially structured tensors
can be efficiently obtained by a variety of approaches, including power
iterations and maximization approaches (similar to the case of matrices). A
detailed analysis of a robust tensor power method is provided, establishing an
analogue of Wedin's perturbation theorem for the singular vectors of matrices.
This implies a robust and computationally tractable estimation approach for
several popular latent variable models.
