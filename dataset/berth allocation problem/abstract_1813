In this work, we present the problem of rash driving detection algorithm
using a single wide angle camera sensor, particularly useful in the Indian
context. To our knowledge this rash driving problem has not been addressed
using Image processing techniques (existing works use other sensors such as
accelerometer). Car Image processing literature, though rich and mature, does
not address the rash driving problem. In this work-in-progress paper, we
present the need to address this problem, our approach and our future plans to
build a rash driving detector.
