Assignment games represent a tractable yet versatile model of two-sided
markets with transfers. We study the likely properties of the core of randomly
generated assignment games. If the joint productivities of every firm and
worker are i.i.d bounded random variables, then with high probability all
workers are paid roughly equal wages, and all firms make similar profits. This
implies that core allocations vary significantly in balanced markets, but that
there is core convergence in even slightly unbalanced markets. For the
benchmark case of uniform distribution, we provide a tight bound for the
workers' share of the surplus under the firm-optimal core allocation. We
present simulation results suggesting that the phenomena analyzed appear even
in medium-sized markets. Finally, we briefly discuss the effects of unbounded
distributions and the ways in which they may affect wage dispersion.
