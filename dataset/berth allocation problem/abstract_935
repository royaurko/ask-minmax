Programming patterns for sequential file access in the .NET Framework are
described and the performance is measured. The default behavior provides
excellent performance on a single disk - 50 MBps both reading and writing.
Using large request sizes and doing file pre-allocation when possible have
quantifiable benefits. When one considers disk arrays, .NET unbuffered IO
delivers 800 MBps on a 16-disk array, but buffered IO delivers about 12% of
that performance. Consequently, high-performance file and database utilities
are still forced to use unbuffered IO for maximum sequential performance. The
report is accompanied by downloadable source code that demonstrates the
concepts and code that was used to obtain these measurements.
