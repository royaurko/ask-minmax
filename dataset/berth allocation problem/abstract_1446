We estimate the CKM matrix elements in the recently proposed minimal model,
anti-SU(7) GUT for the family unification,
$[\,3\,]+2\,[\,2\,]+8\,[\,\bar{1}\,]$+\,(singlets). It is shown that the real
angles of the right-handed unitary matrix diagonalizing the mass matrix can be
determined to fit the Particle Data Group data. However, the phase in the
right-handed unitary matrix is not constrained very much. We also includes an
argument about allocating the Jarlskog phase in the CKM matrix.
Phenomenologically, there are three classes of possible parametrizations,
$\delq=\alpha,\beta,$ or $\gamma$ of the unitarity triangle. For the choice of
$\delq=\alpha$, the phase is close to a maximal one.
