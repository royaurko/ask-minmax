A significant technical challenge in deploying femtocells is controlling the
interference from the underlay of femtos onto the overlay of macros. This paper
presents a novel interference control method where the macrocell bandwidth is
partitioned into subbands, and the short-range femtocell links adaptively
allocate their power across the subbands based on a load-spillage power control
method. The scheme can improve rate distribution in the macro network while
also providing opportunities for short-range communication as well. Moreover,
the proposed scheme requires minimal interference coordination communication
between the femtos and macros, which is one of the main challenges in femtocell
systems. Also, simulations show certain advantages over simpler
orthogonalization schemes or power control schemes without subband
partitioning. Further modest gains may also be possible with interference
cancelation.
