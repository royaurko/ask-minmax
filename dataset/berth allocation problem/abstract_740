This paper considers the optimum single cell power-control maximizing the
aggregate (uplink) communication rate of the cell when there are peak power
constraints at mobile users, and a low-complexity data decoder (without
successive decoding) at the base station. It is shown, via the theory of
majorization, that the optimum power allocation is binary, which means links
are either "on" or "off". By exploiting further structure of the optimum binary
power allocation, a simple polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimum
transmission power allocation is proposed, together with a reduced complexity
near-optimal heuristic algorithm. Sufficient conditions under which
channel-state aware time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) maximizes the
aggregate communication rate are established. Finally, a numerical study is
performed to compare and contrast the performance achieved by the optimum
binary power-control policy with other sub-optimum policies and the throughput
capacity achievable via successive decoding. It is observed that two dominant
modes of communication arise, wideband or TDMA, and that successive decoding
achieves better sum-rates only under near-perfect interference cancellation
efficiency.
