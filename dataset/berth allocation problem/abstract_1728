Motion planning and control are key problems in a collection of robotic
applications including the design of autonomous agile vehicles and of
minimalist manipulators. These problems can be accurately formalized within the
language of affine connections and of geometric control theory. In this paper
we overview recent results on kinematic controllability and on oscillatory
controls. Furthermore, we discuss theoretical and practical open problems as
well as we suggest control theoretical approaches to them.
