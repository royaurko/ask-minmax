Coordinated multi-point (CoMP) schemes have been widely studied in the recent
years to tackle the inter-cell interference. In practice, latency and
throughput constraints on the backhaul allow the organization of only small
clusters of base stations (BSs) where joint processing (JP) can be implemented.
In this work we focus on downlink CoMP-JP with multiple antenna user equipments
(UEs) and propose a novel dynamic clustering algorithm. The additional degrees
of freedom at the UE can be used to suppress the residual interference by using
an interference rejection combiner (IRC) and allow a multistream transmission.
In our proposal we first define a set of candidate clusters depending on
long-term channel conditions. Then, in each time block, we develop a resource
allocation scheme by jointly optimizing transmitter and receiver where: a)
within each candidate cluster a weighted sum rate is estimated and then b) a
set of clusters is scheduled in order to maximize the system weighted sum rate.
Numerical results show that much higher rates are achieved when UEs are
equipped with multiple antennas. Moreover, as this performance improvement is
mainly due to the IRC, the gain achieved by the proposed approach with respect
to the non-cooperative scheme decreases by increasing the number of UE
antennas.
