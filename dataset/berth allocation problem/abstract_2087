The stability problem for the O(N) nonlinear sigma model in the 2+\epsilon
dimensions is considered. We present the results of the 1/N^{2} order
calculations of the critical exponents (in the 2<d<4 dimensions) of the
composite operators relevant for this problem. The arguments in the favor of
the scenario with the conventional fixed point are given.
