The selection process of proposals is a crucial component of scientific
progress and innovations. Limited resources must be allocated in the most
effective way to maximise advancements and the production of new knowledge,
especially as it is becoming increasingly clear that technological and
scientific innovation and creativity is an instrument of economic policy and
social development. The traditional approach based on merit evaluation by
experts has been the preferred method, but there is an issue regarding to what
extent such a method can also be an instrument of effective policy. This paper
discuss some of the basic processes involved in the evaluation and selection of
proposals, indicating some criterion for an optimal solution.
