We analyze the performance of a system composed of two interfering
point-to-point links where the transmitters can exploit a common relay to
improve their individual transmission rate. When the relay uses the
amplify-and-forward protocol we prove that it is not always optimal (in some
sense defined later on) to exploit all the relay transmit power and derive the
corresponding optimal amplification factor. For the case of the
decode-and-forward protocol, already investigated in [1], we show that this
protocol, through the cooperation degree between each transmitter and the
relay, is the only one that naturally introduces a game between the
transmitters. For the estimate-and-forward protocol, we derive two rate regions
for the general case of discrete interference relay channels (IRCs) and
specialize these results to obtain the Gaussian case; these regions correspond
to two compression schemes at the relay, having different resolution levels.
These schemes are compared analytically in some special cases. All the results
mentioned are illustrated by simulations, given in this part, and exploited to
study power allocation games in multi-band IRCs in the second part of this
two-part paper.
