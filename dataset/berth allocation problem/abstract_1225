Intelligent products carrying their own information are more and more present
nowadays. In recent years, some contributors argued the usage of such products for
the Supply Chain Management Industry. Indeed, a multitude of informational
vectors take place in such environments like fixed databases or manufactured
products on which we are able to embed significant proportion of data. By
considering distributed database systems, we can allocate specific data
fragments to the product useful to manage its own evolution. The paper aims to
analyze the Supply Chain performance according to different strategies of
information distribution. Thus, different distribution patterns between
informational vectors are studied. The purpose is to determine the key factors
which lead to improve information distribution performance in term of time
properties.
