The paper contains a discussion on a number of open problems in queueing
theory. Some of them are known for decades, some are more recent. They relate
to stability and to rare events. There is an idea to prepare a special issue of
QUESTA on open problems, and this text may be considered as a prospective
contribution to that. The choice of open problems reflects the contributor's own
interests, and should not be taken as suggesting that these are the only, or
even most important problems!
