The openPC is a set of open source tools that realizes a parallel machine and
distributed computing environment divisible into several independent blocks of
nodes, and each of them is remotely but fully in any means accessible for users
with a full ownership policy. The openPC components address fundamental issues
relating to security, resource access, resource allocation, compatibilities
with heterogeneous middlewares, user-friendly and integrated web-based
interfaces, hardware control and monitoring systems. These components have been
deployed successfully to the LIPI Public Cluster which is open for public use.
In this paper, the unique characteristics of openPC due to its rare
requirements are introduced, its components and a brief performance analysis
are discussed.
