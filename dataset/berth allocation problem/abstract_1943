We study the three-dimensional Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations with scalar
and vector potentials of equal magnitudes as an attempt to give a proper
physical interpretation of this class of problems which has recently been
accumulating interest. We consider a large class of these problems in which the
potentials are noncentral (angular-dependent) such that the equations separate
completely in spherical coordinates. The relativistic energy spectra are
obtained and shown to differ from those of well-known problems that have the
same nonrelativistic limit. Consequently, such problems should not be
misinterpreted as the relativistic extension of the given potentials despite
the fact that the nonrelativistic limit is the same. The Coulomb, Oscillator
and Hartmann potentials are considered. This shows that although the
nonrelativistic limit is well-defined and unique, the relativistic extension is
not. Additionally, we investigate the Klein-Gordon equation with uneven mix of
potentials leading to the correct relativistic extension. We consider the case
of spherically symmetric exponential-type potentials resulting in the s-wave
Klein-Gordon-Morse problem.
