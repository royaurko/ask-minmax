Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) and the evolved Multimedia Broadcast
Multicast System (eMBMS) are the most promising technologies for the delivery
of highly bandwidth demanding applications. In this paper we propose a green
resource allocation strategy for the delivery of layered video streams to users
with different propagation conditions. The goal of the proposed model is to
minimize the user energy consumption. That goal is achieved by minimizing the
time required by each user to receive the broadcast data via an efficient power
transmission allocation model. A key point in our system model is that the
reliability of layered video communications is ensured by means of the Random
Linear Network Coding (RLNC) approach. Analytical results show that the
proposed resource allocation model ensures the desired quality of service
constraints, while the user energy footprint is significantly reduced.
