A well known N P-hard problem called the Generalized Traveling Salesman
Problem (GTSP) is considered. In GTSP the nodes of a complete undirected graph
are partitioned into clusters. The objective is to find a minimum cost tour
passing through exactly one node from each cluster. An exact exponential time
algorithm and an effective meta-heuristic algorithm for the problem are
presented. The meta-heuristic proposed is a modified Ant Colony System (ACS)
algorithm called Reinforcing Ant Colony System (RACS) which introduces new
correction rules in the ACS algorithm. Computational results are reported for
many standard test problems. The proposed algorithm is competitive with the
other already proposed heuristics for the GTSP in both solution quality and
computational time.
