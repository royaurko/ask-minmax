In this paper, we propose a semi-distributed cooperative spectrum sen sing
(SDCSS) and channel access framework for multi-channel cognitive radio networks
(CRNs). In particular, we c onsider a SDCSS scheme where secondary users (SUs)
perform sensing and exchange sensing outcomes with ea ch other to locate
spectrum holes. In addition, we devise the p -persistent CSMA-based cognitive
MAC protocol integrating the SDCSS to enable efficient spectrum sharing among
SUs. We then perform throughput analysis and develop an algorithm to determine
the spectrum sensing and access parameters to maximize the throughput for a
given allocation of channel sensing sets. Moreover, we consider the spectrum
sensing set optimization problem for SUs to maxim ize the overall system
throughput. We present both exhaustive search and low-complexity greedy
algorithms to determine the sensing sets for SUs and analyze their complexity.
We also show how our design and analysis can be extended to consider reporting
errors. Finally, extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the
sig nificant performance gain of our optimized design framework with respect to
non-optimized designs as well as the imp acts of different protocol parameters
on the throughput performance.
