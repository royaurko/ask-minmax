Wireless networking is becoming an increasingly important and popular way of
providing global information access to users on the move. One of the main
challenges for seamless mobility is the availability of simple and robust
handoff algorithms, which allow a mobile node to roam among heterogeneous
wireless networks. In this paper, the contributors devise a scheme, A Novel Adaptive
Channel Allocation Scheme (ACAS) where the number of guard channel(s) is
adjusted automatically based on the average handoff blocking rate measured in
the past certain period of time. The handoff blocking rate is controlled under
the designated threshold and the new call blocking rate is minimized. The
performance evaluation of the ACAS is done through simulation of nodes. The
result shows that the ACAS scheme outperforms the Static Channel Allocation
Scheme by controlling a hard constraint on the handoff rejection probability.
The proposed scheme achieves the optimal performance by maximizing the resource
utilization and adapts itself to changing traffic conditions automatically.
