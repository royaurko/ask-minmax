In this paper we present high performance dynamically allocated multi-queue
(DAMQ) buffer schemes for fault tolerance systems on chip applications that
require an interconnection network. Two or four virtual channels shared the
same buffer space. On the message switching layer, we make improvement to boost
system performance when there are faults involved in the components
communication. The proposed schemes are when a node or a physical channel is
deemed as faulty, the previous hop node will terminate the buffer occupancy of
messages destined to the failed link. The buffer usage decisions are made at
switching layer without interactions with higher abstract layer, thus buffer
space will be released to messages destined to other healthy nodes quickly.
Therefore, the buffer space will be efficiently used in case fault occurs at
some nodes.
