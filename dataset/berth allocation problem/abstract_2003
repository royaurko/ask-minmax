We introduce a new constrained minimization problem that performs template
and pattern detection on a multispectral image in a compressive sensing
context. We use an original minimization problem from Guo and Osher that uses
$L_1$ minimization techniques to perform template detection in a multispectral
image. We first adapt this minimization problem to work with compressive
sensing data. Then we extend it to perform pattern detection using a formal
transform called the spectralization along a pattern. That extension brings out
the problem of measurement reconstruction. We introduce shifted measurements
that allow us to reconstruct all the measurement with a small overhead and we
give an optimality constraint for simple patterns. We present numerical results
showing the performances of the original minimization problem and the
compressed ones with different measurement rates and applied on remotely sensed
data.
