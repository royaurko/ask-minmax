The Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) is becoming a very
significant downlink multiple access technique for high-rate data transmission
in the fourth generation wireless communication systems. By means of efficient
resource allocation higher data rate i.e. throughput can be achieved. This
paper evaluates the performance of criteria used for group (subchannel)
allocation employed in downlink transmission, which results in throughput
maximization. Proposed algorithm gives the modified technique of sub channel
allocation in the downlink transmission of MC-CDMA systems. Simulation are
carried out for all the three combining schemes, results shows that for the
given power and BER proposed algorithm comparatively gives far better results
