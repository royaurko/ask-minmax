The library \emph{fast\_polynomial} for Sage compiles multivariate
polynomials for subsequent fast evaluation. Several evaluation schemes are
handled, such as H\"orner, divide and conquer and new ones can be added easily.
Notably, a new scheme is introduced that improves the classical divide and
conquer scheme when the number of terms is not a pure power of two. Natively,
the library handles polynomials over gmp big integers, boost intervals, python
numeric types. And any type that supports addition and multiplication can
extend the library thanks to the template design. Finally, the code is
parallelized for the divide and conquer schemes, and memory allocation is
localized and optimized for the different evaluation schemes. This extended
abstract presents the concepts behind the \emph{fast\_polynomial} library. The
