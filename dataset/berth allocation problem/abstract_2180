For both the Poisson model problem and the Stokes problem in any dimension,
this paper proves that the enriched Crouzeix-Raviart elements are actually
identical to the first order Raviart-Thomas elements in the sense that they
produce the same discrete stresses. This result improves the previous result in
literature which, for two dimensions, states that the piecewise constant
projection of the stress by the first order Raviart-Thomas element is equal to
that by the Crouzeix-Raviart element. For the eigenvalue problem of Laplace
operator, this paper proves that the error of the enriched Crouzeix-Raviart
element is equivalent to that of the Raviart-Thomas element up to higher order
terms.
