There has been growing interest in increasing the amount of radio spectrum
available for unlicensed broad-band wireless access. That includes "prime"
spectrum at lower frequencies, which is also suitable for wide area coverage by
licensed cellular providers. While additional unlicensed spectrum would allow
for market expansion, it could influence competition among providers and
increase congestion (interference) among consumers of wireless services. We
study the value (social welfare and consumer surplus) obtained by adding
unlicensed spectrum to an existing allocation of licensed spectrum among
incumbent service providers. We assume a population of customers who choose a
provider based on the minimum delivered price, given by the weighted sum of the
price of the service and a congestion cost, which depends on the number of
subscribers in a band. We consider models in which this weighting is uniform
across the customer population and where the weighting is either high or low,
reflecting different sensitivities to latency. For the models considered, we
find that the social welfare depends on the amount of additional unlicensed
spectrum, and can actually decrease over a significant range of unlicensed
bandwidths. Furthermore, with nonuniform weighting, introducing unlicensed
spectrum can also reduce consumer welfare.
