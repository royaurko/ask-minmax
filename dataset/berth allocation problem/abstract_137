Despite the numerous benefits brought by Device-to-Device (D2D)
communications, the introduction of D2D into cellular networks poses many new
challenges in the resource allocation design due to the co-channel interference
caused by spectrum reuse and limited battery life of User Equipments (UEs).
Most of the previous studies mainly focus on how to maximize the Spectral
Efficiency (SE) and ignore the energy consumption of UEs. In this paper, we
study how to maximize each UE's Energy Efficiency (EE) in an
interference-limited environment subject to its specific Quality of Service
(QoS) and maximum transmission power constraints. We model the resource
allocation problem as a noncooperative game, in which each player is
self-interested and wants to maximize its own EE. A distributed
interference-aware energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm is proposed
by exploiting the properties of the nonlinear fractional programming. We prove
that the optimum solution obtained by the proposed algorithm is the Nash
equilibrium of the noncooperative game. We also analyze the tradeoff between EE
and SE and derive closed-form expressions for EE and SE gaps.
