This article addresses an optimal control problem arising in attitude control
of a spacecraft under state and control constraints. The attitude dynamics
model is first derived in discrete time using discrete mechanics. Then the
energy optimal control problem is posed in discrete time and first order
necessary conditions are derived using variational analysis. Since both the
control and the states are subject to inequality constraints, the boundary
value problem obtained as first order necessary conditions is subject to
inequality constraints on the states and the Lagrange's multipliers
corresponding to the state inequality constraints. This boundary value problem
cannot be solved using classical multiple shooting techniques, so we propose a
modified multiple shooting algorithm that can handle the state inequality
constraints. We also demonstrate how the discrete time model derived using
discrete mechanics reduces the dimension of the problem.
