In wireless mesh network (WMN), multiple service providers (SPs) can
cooperate to share resources (e.g., relay nodes and spectrum), to serve their
collective subscribed customers for better service. As a reward, SPs are able
to achieve more individual benefits, i.e., increased revenue or decreased cost,
through efficient utilization of shared network resources. However, this
cooperation can be realized only if fair allocation of aggregated payoff, which
is the sum of the payoff of all the cooperative SPs, can be achieved. We first
formulate such cooperation as a coalitional game with transferable utility,
specifically, a linear programming game, in which, each SP should obtain the
fair share of the aggregated payoff. Then we study the problem of allocating
aggregated payoff which leads to stable service coalition of SPs in WMN based
on the concepts of dual payoff and Shapley value.
