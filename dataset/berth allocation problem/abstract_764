The tremendous increase in mobile data traffic coupled with fierce
competition in wireless industry brings about spectrum scarcity and bandwidth
fragmentation. This inevitably results in asymmetric-valued LTE spectrum
allocation that stems from different timing for twice improvement in capacity
between competing operators, given spectrum allocations today. This motivates
us to study the economic effects of asymmetric-valued LTE spectrum allocation.
In this paper, we formulate the interactions between operators and users as a
hierarchical dynamic game framework, where two spiteful operators
simultaneously make spectrum acquisition decisions in the upper-level
first-price sealed-bid auction game, and dynamic pricing decisions in the
lower-level differential game, taking into account user subscription dynamics.
Using backward induction, we derive the equilibrium of the entire game under
mild conditions. Through analytical and numerical results, we verify our
studies by comparing the latest result of LTE spectrum auction in South Korea,
which serves as the benchmark of asymmetric-valued LTE spectrum auction
designs.
