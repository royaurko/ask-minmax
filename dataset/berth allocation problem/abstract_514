Resource management and scheduling plays a crucial role in achieving high
utilization of resources in grid computing environments. Due to heterogeneity
of resources, scheduling an application is significantly complicated and
challenging task in grid system. Most of the researches in this area are mainly
focused on to improve the performance of the grid system. There were some
allocation model has been proposed based on divisible load theory with
different type of workloads and a single originating processor. In this paper
we introduce a new resource allocation model with multiple load originating
processors as an economic model. Solutions for an optimal allocation of
fraction of loads to nodes obtained to minimize the cost of the grid users via
linear programming approach. It is found that the resource allocation model can
efficiently and effectively allocate workloads to proper resources.
Experimental results showed that the proposed model obtained the better
solution in terms of cost and time.
