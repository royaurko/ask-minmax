The rapid growth of data volume and the accompanying congestion problems over
the wireless networks have been critical issues to content providers. A novel
technique, termed as coded cache, is proposed to relieve the burden. Through
creating coded-multicasting opportunities, the coded-cache scheme can provide
extra performance gain over the conventional push technique that simply
pre-stores contents at local caches during the network idle period. But
existing works on the coded caching scheme assumed the availability of an
error-free shared channel accessible by each user. This paper considers the
more realistic scenario where each user may experience different link quality.
In this case, the system performance would be restricted by the user with the
worst channel condition. And the corresponding resource allocation schemes
aimed at breaking this obstacles are developed. Specifically, we employ the
coded caching scheme in time division and frequency division transmission mode
and formulate the sub-optimal problems. Power and bandwidth are allocated
respectively to maximum the system throughput. The simulation results show that
the throughput of the technique in wireless scenario will be limited and would
decrease as the number of users becomes sufficiently large.
