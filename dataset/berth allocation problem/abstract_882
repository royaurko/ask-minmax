Tagging is nowadays the most prevalent and practical way to make images
searchable. However, in reality many manually-assigned tags are irrelevant to
image content and hence are not reliable for applications. A lot of recent
efforts have been conducted to refine image tags. In this paper, we propose to
do tag refinement from the angle of topic modeling and present a novel
graphical model, regularized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (rLDA). In the
proposed approach, tag similarity and tag relevance are jointly estimated in an
iterative manner, so that they can benefit from each other, and the multi-wise
relationships among tags are explored. Moreover, both the statistics of tags
and visual affinities of images in the corpus are explored to help topic
modeling. We also analyze the superiority of our approach from the deep
structure perspective. The experiments on tag ranking and image retrieval
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.
