Multicell joint processing can mitigate inter-cell interference and thereby
increase the spectral efficiency of cellular systems. Most previous work has
assumed phase-aligned (coherent) transmissions from different base transceiver
stations (BTSs), which is difficult to achieve in practice. In this work, a
noncoherent cooperative transmission scheme for the downlink is studied, which
does not require phase alignment. The focus is on jointly serving two users in
adjacent cells sharing the same resource block. The two BTSs partially share
their messages through a backhaul link, and each BTS transmits a superposition
of two codewords, one for each receiver. Each receiver decodes its own message,
and treats the signals for the other receiver as background noise. With
narrowband transmissions the achievable rate region and maximum achievable
weighted sum rate are characterized by optimizing the power allocation (and the
beamforming vectors in the case of multiple transmit antennas) at each BTS
between its two codewords. For a wideband (multicarrier) system, a dual
formulation of the optimal power allocation problem across sub-carriers is
presented, which can be efficiently solved by numerical methods. Results show
that the proposed cooperation scheme can improve the sum rate substantially in
the low to moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range.
