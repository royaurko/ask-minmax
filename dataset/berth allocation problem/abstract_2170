We study the result by Bogdanov and Trevisan (FOCS, 2003), who show that
under reasonable assumptions, there is no non-adaptive worst-case to
average-case reduction that bases the average-case hardness of an NP-problem on
the worst-case complexity of an NP-complete problem. We replace the hiding and
the heavy samples protocol in [BT03] by employing the histogram verification
protocol of Haitner, Mahmoody and Xiao (CCC, 2010), which proves to be very
useful in this context. Once the histogram is verified, our hiding protocol is
directly public-coin, whereas the intuition behind the original protocol
inherently relies on private coins.
