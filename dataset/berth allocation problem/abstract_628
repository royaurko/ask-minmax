In this paper, we design a resource allocation framework for the
delay-sensitive Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) broadcast system with limited
feedback. Considering the scarcity and interrelation of the transmit power and
feedback bandwidth, it is imperative to optimize the two resources in a joint
and efficient manner while meeting the delay-QoS requirement. Based on the
effective bandwidth theory, we first obtain a closed-form expression of average
violation probability with respect to a given delay requirement as a function
of transmit power and codebook size of feedback channel. By minimizing the
total resource cost, we derive an optimal joint resource allocation scheme,
which can flexibly adjust the transmit power and feedback bandwidth according
to the characteristics of the system. Moreover, through asymptotic analysis,
some simple resource allocation schemes are presented. Finally, the theoretical
claims are validated by numerical results.
