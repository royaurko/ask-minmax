While for single processor and SMP machines, memory is the allocatable
quantity, for machines made up of large amounts of parallel computing units,
each with its own local memory, the allocatable quantity is a single computing
unit. Where virtual address management is used to keep memory coherent and
allow allocation of more than physical memory is actually available, virtual
communication channel references can be used to make computing units stay
connected across allocation and swapping.
