We consider the decentralized power allocation and spectrum sharing problem
in multi-user, multi-channel systems with strategic users. We present a
mechanism/game form that has the following desirable features. (1) It is
individually rational. (2) It is budget balanced at every Nash equilibrium of
the game induced by the game form as well as off equilibrium. (3) The
allocation corresponding to every Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game induced by
the mechanism is a Lindahl allocation, that is a weakly Pareto optimal
allocation. Our proposed game form/mechanism achieves all the above desirable
properties without any assumption about, concavity, differentiability,
monotonicity, or quasi-linearity of the users' utility functions.
