We consider the one helper source coding problem posed and investigated by
Ahlswede, K\"orner and Wyner. In this system, the error probability of decoding
goes to one as the source block length $n$ goes to infinity. This implies that
we have a strong converse theorem for the one helper source coding problem. In
this paper we provide a much stronger version of this strong converse theorem
for the one helper source coding problem. We prove that the error probability
of decoding tends to one exponentially and derive an explicit lower bound of
this exponent function.
