IEEE 802.16 OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) technology
has emerged as a promising technology for broadband access in a Wireless
Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) environment. In this paper, we address the
problem of queueing theoretic performance modeling and analysis of OFDMA under
broad-band wireless networks. We consider a single-cell IEEE 802.16 environment
in which the base station allocates subchannels to the subscriber stations in
its coverage area. The subchannels allocated to a subscriber station are shared
by multiple connections at that subscriber station. To ensure the Quality of
Service (QoS) performances, a Connection Admission Control (CAC) scheme is
considered at a subscriber station. A queueing analytical framework for these
admission control schemes is presented considering OFDMA-based transmission at
the physical layer. Then, based on the queueing model, both the
connection-level and the packet-level performances are studied and compared
with their analogues in the case without CAC. The connection arrival is modeled
by a Poisson process and the packet arrival for a connection by a two-state
Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP). We determine analytically and
numerically different performance parameters, such as connection blocking
probability, average number of ongoing connections, average queue length,
packet dropping probability, queue throughput and average packet delay.
