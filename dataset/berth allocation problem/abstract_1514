This paper investigates reliable and covert transmission strategies in a
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel with a transmitter,
receiver and an adversarial wiretapper, each equipped with multiple antennas.
In a departure from existing work, the wiretapper possesses a novel capability
to act either as a passive eavesdropper or as an active jammer, under a
half-duplex constraint. The transmitter therefore faces a choice between
allocating all of its power for data, or broadcasting artificial interference
along with the information signal in an attempt to jam the eavesdropper
(assuming its instantaneous channel state is unknown). To examine the resulting
trade-offs for the legitimate transmitter and the adversary, we model their
interactions as a two-person zero-sum game with the ergodic MIMO secrecy rate
as the payoff function. We first examine conditions for the existence of
pure-strategy Nash equilibria (NE) and the structure of mixed-strategy NE for
the strategic form of the game.We then derive equilibrium strategies for the
extensive form of the game where players move sequentially under scenarios of
perfect and imperfect information. Finally, numerical simulations are presented
to examine the equilibrium outcomes of the various scenarios considered.
