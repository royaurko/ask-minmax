A multi-antenna transmitter that conveys independent sets of common data to
distinct groups of users is herein considered, a model known as physical layer
multicasting to multiple co-channel groups. In the recently proposed context of
per-antenna power constrained multigroup multicasting, the present work focuses
on a novel system design that aims at maximizing the total achievable
throughput. Towards increasing the system sum rate, the available power
resources need to be allocated to well conditioned groups of users. A detailed
solution to tackle the elaborate sum rate maximization multigroup multicast
problem under per-antenna power constraints is therefore derived. Numerical
results are presented to quantify the gains of the proposed algorithm over
heuristic solutions. Besides Rayleigh faded channels, the solution is also
applied to uniform linear array transmitters operating in the far field, where
line-ofsight conditions are realized. In this setting, a sensitivity analysis
with respect to the angular separation of co-group users is included. Finally,
a simple scenario providing important intuitions for the sum rate maximizing
multigroup multicast solutions is elaborated.
