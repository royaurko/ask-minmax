Computer Mediated Courseware (CMC) has been developed so far for individual
courses considering single or multiple text books. A group of courseware can be
developed by using multiple text books and in this case, it is a requirement to
cluster the contents of different books to form a generalized clustered
content. No work has been found to develop courseware applying generalized
clustered content. We have proposed a clustering of content supporting computer
mediated courseware development based on data mining techniques to construct a
hierarchical general structure of a group of courseware combining the
individual structure of a set of books. The clustering will help the courseware
developer to dynamically allocate contents to develop different courses using a
group of books. The contributors have applied this methodology for different level
of courses on database. The methodology is generalized and can be applied to
any other courses.
