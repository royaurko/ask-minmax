We study the impact of disinformation on a model of resource allocation with
independent selfish agents: clients send requests to one of two servers,
depending on which one is perceived as offering shorter waiting times. Delays
in the information about the servers' state leads to oscillations in load.
Servers can give false information about their state (global disinformation) or
refuse service to individual clients (local disinformation). We discuss the
tradeoff between positive effects of disinformation (attenuation of
oscillations) and negative effects (increased fluctuations and reduced
adaptability) for different parameter values.
