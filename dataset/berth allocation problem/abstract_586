We investigate two common numerical techniques for integrating reversible
moist processes in atmospheric flows in the context of solving the fully
compressible Euler equations. The first is a one-step, coupled technique based
on using appropriate invariant variables such that terms resulting from phase
change are eliminated in the governing equations. In the second approach, which
is a two-step scheme, separate transport equations for liquid water and vapor
water are used, and no conversion between water vapor and liquid water is
allowed in the first step, while in the second step a saturation adjustment
procedure is performed that correctly allocates the water into its two phases
based on the Clausius-Clapeyron formula. The numerical techniques we describe
are first validated by comparing to a well-established benchmark problem.
Particular attention is then paid to the effect of changing the time scale at
which the moist variables are adjusted to the saturation requirements in two
different variations of the two-step scheme. This study is motivated by the
fact that when acoustic modes are integrated separately in time (neglecting
phase change related phenomena), or when sound-proof equations are integrated,
the time scale for imposing saturation adjustment is typically much larger than
the numerical one related to the acoustics.
