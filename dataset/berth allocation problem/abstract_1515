We study a model cosmological solution of the coupled Einstein,
electromagnetic (with source) and second-gravity \cite{Nash2010} equations that
employs a flat universe Friedmann-\text{Lema{\^ \i}tre}-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
line element with scale factor $a = a(t)$ [comoving coordinates] for the
Einstein sector. The solution of the coupled field equations yields a scale
factor $a(t)$ that initially varies exponentially $a(t) = a(0) {e}^{H t}$.
Exponential growth continues until the comoving time approaches the end of
inflation, then $a(t)$ rapidly transitions to a power law dependence on $t$.
Concomitant with the transition from inflation in this model is a natural
re-heating and excitation of Standard Model degrees of freedom, and in
particular of electrically charged quarks and leptons. No scalar inflaton
field, or slow-roll potential is introduced to achieve these effects.
  This model is noteworthy in two respects. A plausible connection between the
second-gravity \emph{unit} field $\mathbf{u}$ and Dark Energy, through the
generalization of the photon wave function, is demonstrated, and a scenario is
outlined that allocates a 75% fraction of the total energy of the Universe to
Dark Energy. Secondly, we conjecture that an experimentally detectable
substructure of the of the photon can be observed if the (quantized) unit field
can be excited out of its ground state.
