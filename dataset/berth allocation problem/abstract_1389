If people with high risk of suicide can be identified through social media
like microblog, it is possible to implement an active intervention system to
save their lives. Based on this motivation, the current study administered the
Suicide Probability Scale(SPS) to 1041 weibo users at Sina Weibo, which is a
leading microblog service provider in China. Two NLP (Natural Language
Processing) methods, the Chinese edition of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
(LIWC) lexicon and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are used to extract
linguistic features from the Sina Weibo data. We trained predicting models by
machine learning algorithm based on these two types of features, to estimate
suicide probability based on linguistic features. The experiment results
indicate that LDA can find topics that relate to suicide probability, and
improve the performance of prediction. Our study adds value in prediction of
suicidal probability of social network users with their behaviors.
