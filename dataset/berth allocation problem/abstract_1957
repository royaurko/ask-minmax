In this paper we apply our results on the geometry of polygons in Cartan
subspaces, symmetric spaces and buildings to four problems in algebraic group
theory. Two of these problems are generalizations of the problems of finding
the constraints on the eigenvalues (resp. singular values) of a sum (resp.
product) when the eigenvalues (singular values) of each summand (factor) are
fixed. The other two problems are related to the computation of the structure
constants of the Hecke and representation rings associated with a split
reductive algebraic group over Q and its complex Langlands' dual. We give a new
proof of the ``Saturation Conjecture'' for GL(m) as a consequence of our
solution of the corresponding ``saturation problem'' for the Hecke structure
constants for all split reductive algebraic groups over Q.
