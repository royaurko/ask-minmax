Under risk, Arrow-Debreu equilibria can be implemented as Radner equilibria
by continuous trading of few long-lived securities. We show that this result
generically fails if there is Knightian uncertainty in the volatility.
Implementation is only possible if all discounted net trades of the equilibrium
allocation are mean ambiguity-free.
