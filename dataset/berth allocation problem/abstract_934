Directed signature scheme is applicable when the signed message contains
information sensitive to the receiver, because only receiver can directly
verify the signature and that he/she can prove its validity to any third party,
whenever necessary. This paper presents two applications of directed signature
scheme. (i) Directed &#8211;Delegated Signature Scheme. This scheme combines
the idea of proxy signatures with directed signature scheme. (ii) Allocation of
registration number. This scheme proposes a registration scheme in which the
registration number cannot be forged and misused.
