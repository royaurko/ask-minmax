In this paper, we propose a coordinated regularized zero-forcing (RZF)
precoding method for limited feedback multicell multiuser (MU) multiple-input
single-output (MISO) systems. We begin by deriving an approximation to the
expected signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the proposed scheme
with perfect channel direction information (CDI) at the base station (BS). We
also derive an expected SINR approximation for limited feedback systems with
random vector quantization (RVQ) based quantized CDI at the BS. Using the
expected interference result for the RVQ based limited feedback CDI, we propose
an adaptive feedback bit allocation strategy. The proposed feedback bit
allocation minimizes the expected interference at the user by partitioning the
total number of bits between the serving and out-of-cell interfering channels.
Numerical results show that the proposed coordinated RZF precoding scheme
achieves superior average cell-edge spectral efficiency compared to the
non-coordinated RZF precoding scheme. Also, the proposed adaptive feedback bit
allocation method offers a spectral efficiency gain higher than conventional
equal bit allocation and existing coordinated zero-forcing (ZF) schemes.
