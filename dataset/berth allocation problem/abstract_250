We provide a new characterization of mean-variance hedging strategies in a
general semimartingale market. The key point is the introduction of a new
probability measure $P^{\star}$ which turns the dynamic asset allocation
problem into a myopic one. The minimal martingale measure relative to
$P^{\star}$ coincides with the variance-optimal martingale measure relative to
the original probability measure $P$.
