This paper studies the cooperative global robust stabilization problem for a
class of nonlinear multi-agent systems. The problem is motivated from the study
of the cooperative global robust output regulation problem for the class of
nonlinear multi-agent systems in normal form with unity relative degree which
was studied recently under the conditions that the switching network is
undirected and some nonlinear functions satisfy certain growth condition. We
first solve the stabilization problem by using the multiple Lyapunov functions
approach and the average dwell time method. Then, we apply this result to the
cooperative global robust output regulation problem for the class of nonlinear
systems in normal form with unity relative degree under directed switching
network, and have removed the conditions that the switching network is
undirected and some nonlinear functions satisfy certain growth condition.
