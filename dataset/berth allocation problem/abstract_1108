Networked Controlled Systems (NCSs) are more and more used in industrial
applications. They are strongly connected to real-time constraints because
important delays induced by the network can lead to an unstable process
control. Usually, the network used in NCSs is shared with many others
applications requiring different Quality of Service. The objective of this
paper is to optimize the tuning of the network scheduling mechanisms in taking
into account the level of Quality of Control. The goal is to maximize the
bandwidth allocation for unconstrained frames in guarantying that the control
constraints are respected. In this paper, we focus on switched Ethernet network
implementing the Classification of Service (IEEE 802.1p) based on a Weighted
Round Robin policy.
