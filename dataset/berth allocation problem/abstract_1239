This paper proposes an original theory of aging of multicellular organisms.
The cells of multicellular organisms, in contrast to unicellular organisms, are
burdened with a two- part genome: housekeeping and specialized (multicellular),
responsible for ontogenesis and terminal differentiation. The two parts of the
genome compete for limited adaptive resources thereby interfering with the
ability of the house-keeping part of the genome to adequately perform
reparative and adaptive functions in post mitotic cells. The necessity to
complete the ontgenesis program, leads to increased activity of the
multicellular components of the genome. As a result, the allocation of cellular
resources to specialized genome con-tinuously increases with time. This leads
to a deficit of reparative and adaptive capacity in post mitotic cells.
Suggestions for future research focus on identifying groups of genes
responsible for regulation of growth rate of specialized genome and suppressing
ability of the cell division. A better understanding of the relationship
between the two parts of the genome will not only help us to manipulate
ontogenesis and aging, but will also improve our understanding of cancer
development and ontogenesis.
