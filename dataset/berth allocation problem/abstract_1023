Cloud computing systems promise to offer subscription-oriented,
enterprise-quality computing services to users worldwide. With the increased
demand for delivering services to a large number of users, they need to offer
differentiated services to users and meet their quality expectations. Existing
resource management systems in data centers are yet to support Service Level
Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation, and thus need to be enhanced to
realize cloud computing and utility computing. In addition, no work has been
done to collectively incorporate customer-driven service management,
computational risk management, and autonomic resource management into a
market-based resource management system to target the rapidly changing
enterprise requirements of Cloud computing. This paper presents vision,
challenges, and architectural elements of SLA-oriented resource management. The
proposed architecture supports integration of marketbased provisioning policies
and virtualisation technologies for flexible allocation of resources to
applications. The performance results obtained from our working prototype
system shows the feasibility and effectiveness of SLA-based resource
provisioning in Clouds.
