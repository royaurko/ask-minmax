A new approach to the solution of Economic Dispatch using Particle Swarm
Optimization is presented. It is the progression of allocating production
amongst the dedicated units such that the restriction forced are fulfilled and
the power needs are reduced. More just, the soft computing method has received
supplementary concentration and was used in a quantity of successful and
sensible applications. Here, an attempt has been made to find out the minimum
cost by using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm using the data of three
generating units. In this work, data has been taken such as the loss
coefficients with the max-min power limit and cost function. PSO and Simulated
Annealing are functional to put out the least amount for dissimilar energy
requirements. When the outputs are compared with the conventional method, PSO
seems to give an improved result with enhanced convergence feature. All the
methods are executed in MATLAB environment. The effectiveness and feasibility
of the proposed method were demonstrated by three generating units case study.
Output gives hopeful results, signifying that the projected method of
calculation is competent of economically formative advanced eminence solutions
addressing economic dispatch problems.
