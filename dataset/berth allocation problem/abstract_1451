The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a key building block of the World
Wide Web, has succeeded to enable information exchange worldwide. Since its
first version in 1996, HTTP/1.0, the average number of inlined objects and
average total bytes per webpage have been increasing significantly for desktops
and mobiles, from 1-10 objects in 1996 to more than 100 objects in June 2014.
Even if the retrieving of inlined objects can be parallelized as a given
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) document is streamed, a maximum number of
connections is allocated, and thus as the number of inlined objects increases,
the overall webpage load duration grows, and the HTTP servers loading also gets
higher. To overcome this issue, we propose a new HTTP method called BURST,
which allows to retrieve the missing inlined objects of a webpage efficiently
by requesting sets of web objects. We experimentally demonstrate the potential
via a proof-of-concept demonstration, by comparing the regular HTTP to proposed
HTTP-Burst using a virtual private server and real HTTP client and server over
the Internet. The results indicate a latency reduction of webpage load duration
compared to HTTP as high as 52 % under the considered configurations.
