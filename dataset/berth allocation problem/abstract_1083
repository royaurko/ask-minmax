Type Ia supernovae provide direct evidence for an accelerating universe, and
for the existence of "dark energy" driving this expansion. The Supernova Legacy
Survey (SNLS) will deliver many hundreds of SNIa detections, and well-sampled
g'r'i'z' light curves, over the next 5 years. Using these data, we will obtain
a precise measurement of the cosmological parameters (Omega_mass,
Omega_Lambda); our goal is to determine the cosmological equation of state
parameter w to a precision better than +-0.10, and hence test theories for the
origin of the universal acceleration. SNLS uses the CFHT MegaCam imager (400
Megapixels, 1 deg^2) to image four fields around the sky in 4 filters, with
typical time sampling of 3--4 nights. A total of 202 nights of CFHT time has
been allocated over the next 5 years for these observations; a large program of
followup spectroscopy is now underway at VLT, Gemini, Keck, and Magellan. SNLS
has been running since August 2003. There now exist about 330 reliable SN
detections with excellent light curves out to beyond redshift 0.9, of which
about 80 have been spectroscopically identified as Type Ia's. See

SN discoveries.
