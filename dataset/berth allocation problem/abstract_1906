The category of all idempotent generated semigroups with a prescribed
structure $\mathcal{E}$ of their idempotents $E$ (called the biordered set) has
an initial object called the free idempotent generated semigroup over
$\mathcal{E}$, defined by a presentation over alphabet $E$, and denoted by
$\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$. Recently, much effort has been put into
investigating the structure of semigroups of the form
$\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$, especially regarding their maximal subgroups. In
this paper we take these investigations in a new direction by considering the
word problem for $\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$. We prove two principal results,
one positive and one negative. We show that, given a word $w \in E^*$, it is
decidable whether $w$ represents a regular element; if in addition one assumes
that all maximal subgroups of $\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$ have decidable word
problems, then the word problem in $\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$ restricted to
regular words is decidable. On the other hand, we exhibit a biorder
$\mathcal{E}$ arising from a finite idempotent semigroup $S$, such that the
word problem for $\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$ is undecidable, even though all the
maximal subgroups have decidable word problems. This is achieved by relating
the word problem of $\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$ to the subgroup membership
problem in finitely presented groups.
