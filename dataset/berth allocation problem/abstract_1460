The main aim of this paper is to discuss how the combination of Web 2.0,
social media and geographic technologies can provide opportunities for learning
and new forms of participation in an urban design studio. This discussion is
mainly based on our recent findings from two experimental urban design studio
setups as well as former research and literature studies. In brief, the web
platform enabled us to extend the learning that took place in the design studio
beyond the studio hours, to represent the design information in novel ways and
allocate multiple communication forms. We found that the student activity in
the introduced web platform was related to their progress up to a certain
extent. Moreover, the students perceived the platform as a convenient medium
and addressed it as a valuable resource for learning. This study should be
conceived as a continuation of a series of our Design Studio 2.0 experiments
which involve the exploitation of opportunities provided by novel
socio-geographic information and communication technologies for the improvement
of the design learning processes.
