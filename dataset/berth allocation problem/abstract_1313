We live within an increasingly technological, information-laden environment
for the first time in human evolution.This subjects us, and will continue to
subject us in an accelerating fashion, to an unremitting exposure to meaningful
information that requires action. Directly dependent upon this new environment
are novel evolutionary pressures, which can modify existing resource allocation
mechanisms and may eventually favor the survival of somatic cells,particularly
neurons, at the expense of germ line cells. Here it is argued that persistent,
structured information-sharing in both virtual and real domains, leads to
increased biological complexity and functionality, which reflects upon human
survival characteristics. Certain immortalisation mechanisms currently employed
by germ cells may thus need to be downgraded in order to enable somatic cells
to manage these new energy demands placed by our modern environment. Relevant
concepts from a variety of disciplines such as the evolution of complex
adaptive systems, information theory, digital hyper-connectivity, and cell
immortalisation will be reviewed.
