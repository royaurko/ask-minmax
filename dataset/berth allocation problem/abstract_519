Auctions for perishable goods such as internet ad inventory need to make
real-time allocation and pricing decisions as the supply of the good arrives in
an online manner, without knowing the entire supply in advance. These
allocation and pricing decisions get complicated when buyers have some global
constraints. In this work, we consider a multi-unit model where buyers have
global {\em budget} constraints, and the supply arrives in an online manner.
Our main contribution is to show that for this setting there is an
individually-rational, incentive-compatible and Pareto-optimal auction that
allocates these units and calculates prices on the fly, without knowledge of
the total supply. We do so by showing that the Adaptive Clinching Auction
satisfies a {\em supply-monotonicity} property.
  We also analyze and discuss, using examples, how the insights gained by the
allocation and payment rule can be applied to design better ad allocation
heuristics in practice. Finally, while our main technical result concerns
multi-unit supply, we propose a formal model of online supply that captures
scenarios beyond multi-unit supply and has applications to sponsored search. We
conjecture that our results for multi-unit auctions can be extended to these
more general models.
