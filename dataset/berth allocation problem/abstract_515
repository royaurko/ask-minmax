The economic equities maximization criterion (MFPE) leads to the choice of
financial portfolio, which maximizes the ratio of the expected value of the
insurance company on the capital. This criterion is presented in the framework
of a non-life insurance company and is applied within the framework of the
French legislation and in a lawful context inspired of the works in progress
about the European project Solvency 2. In the French regulation case, the
required solvency margin does not depend of the asset allocation. It is quite
different in the Solvency 2 framework because the target capital has to control
the global risk of the company. And the financial risk takes part of this
global risk. Thus the economic equities maximization criterion leads to search
a couple asset allocation / equities which solves a stochastic program. A
numerical illustration makes it possible to analyze the consequences of the
introduction of a Solvency 2 framework on the technical reserves and the
equities of a non-life insurance company and on the optimal allocation due to
the economic equities maximization criterion. Finally, the impact of a
misspecification of the risky asset model on the optimal allocation is
illustrated.
