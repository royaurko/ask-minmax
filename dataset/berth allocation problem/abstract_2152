Developing an original idea of De Giorgi, we introduce a new and purely
variational approach to the Cauchy Problem for a wide class of defocusing
hyperbolic equations. The main novel feature is that the solutions are obtained
as limits of functions that minimize suitable functionals in space-time (where
the initial data of the Cauchy Problem serve as prescribed boundary
conditions). This opens up the way to new connections between the hyperbolic
world and that of the Calculus of Variations. Also dissipative equations can be
treated. Finally, we discuss several examples of equations that fit in this
framework, including nonlocal equations, in particular equations with the
fractional Laplacian.
