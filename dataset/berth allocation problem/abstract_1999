Several generalizations of the traditional Tikhonov-Phillips regularization
method have been proposed during the last two decades. Many of these
generalizations are based upon inducing stability throughout the use of
different penalizers which allow the capturing of diverse properties of the
exact solution (e.g. edges, discontinuities, borders, etc.). However, in some
problems in which it is known that the regularity of the exact solution is
heterogeneous and/or anisotropic, it is reasonable to think that a much better
option could be the simultaneous use of two or more penalizers of different
nature. Such is the case, for instance, in some image restoration problems in
which preservation of edges, borders or discontinuities is an important matter.
In this work we present some results on the simultaneous use of penalizers of
$L^2$ and of bounded variation (BV) type. For particular cases, existence and
uniqueness results are proved. Open problems are discussed and results to
signal restoration problems are presented.
