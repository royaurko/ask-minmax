Mobile sensing has become a promising paradigm for mobile users to obtain
information by task crowdsourcing. However, due to the social preferences of
mobile users, the quality of sensing reports may be impacted by the underlying
social attributes and selfishness of individuals. Therefore, it is crucial to
consider the social impacts and trustworthiness of mobile users when selecting
task participants in mobile sensing. In this paper, we propose a Social Aware
Crowdsourcing with Reputation Management (SACRM) scheme to select the
well-suited participants and allocate the task rewards in mobile sensing.
Specifically, we consider the social attributes, task delay and reputation in
crowdsourcing and propose a participant selection scheme to choose the
well-suited participants for the sensing task under a fixed task budget. A
report assessment and rewarding scheme is also introduced to measure the
quality of the sensing reports and allocate the task rewards based the assessed
report quality. In addition, we develop a reputation management scheme to
evaluate the trustworthiness and cost performance ratio of mobile users for
participant selection. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations
demonstrate that SACRM can efficiently improve the crowdsourcing utility and
effectively stimulate the participants to improve the quality of their sensing
reports.
