In this paper, we consider a multihop wireless sensor network (WSN) with
multiple relay nodes for each hop where the amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme is
employed. We present a strategy to jointly design the linear receiver and the
power allocation parameters via an alternating optimization approach that
maximizes the sum rate of the WSN. We derive constrained maximum sum-rate (MSR)
expressions along with an algorithm to compute the linear receiver and the
power allocation parameters with the optimal complex amplification coefficients
for each relay node. Computer simulations show good performance of our proposed
methods in terms of sum rate compared to the method with equal power
allocation.
