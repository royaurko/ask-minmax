Determining the complexity of the reachability problem for vector addition
systems with states (VASS) is a long-standing open problem in computer science.
Long known to be decidable, the problem to this day lacks any complexity upper
bound whatsoever. In this paper, reachability for two-dimensional VASS is shown
PSPACE-complete. This improves on a previously known doubly exponential time
bound established by Howell, Rosier, Huynh and Yen in 1986. The coverability
and boundedness problems are also noted to be PSPACE-complete. In addition,
some complexity results are given for the reachability problem in
two-dimensional VASS and in integer VASS when numbers are encoded in unary.
