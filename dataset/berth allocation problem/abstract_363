The study investigated the allocation of transmission power and bits for a
point-to-point orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing channel assuming
perfect channel information at the receiver, but imperfect channel information
at the transmitter. Channel information was quantized at the receiver and was
sent back to the transmitter via a finite-rate feedback channel. Based on
limited feedback from the receiver, the corresponding transmitter adapted the
power level and/or modulation across subcarriers. To reduce the amount of
feedback, subcarriers were partitioned into different clusters and an on/off
threshold-based power allocation was applied to subcarrier clusters. In
addition, two options were proposed to interpolate a channel frequency response
from a set of quantized channel gains and apply the optimal water-filling
allocation or a greedy bit allocation based on channel interpolation. Proposed
schemes with finite feedback rates were shown to perform close to the optimal
allocation without a feedback-rate constraint. In the numerical example,
channel capacity decreased about 6% from the optimum when one bit of feedback
per subcarrier was used.
