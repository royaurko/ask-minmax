The Service Level Agreement~(SLA) based grid superscheduling approach
promotes coordinated resource sharing. Superscheduling is facilitated between
administratively and topologically distributed grid sites by grid schedulers
such as Resource brokers. In this work, we present a market-based SLA
coordination mechanism. We based our SLA model on a well known \emph{contract
net protocol}.
  The key advantages of our approach are that it allows:~(i) resource owners to
have finer degree of control over the resource allocation that was previously
not possible through traditional mechanism; and (ii) superschedulers to bid for
SLA contracts in the contract net with focus on completing the job within the
user specified deadline. In this work, we use simulation to show the
effectiveness of our proposed approach.
