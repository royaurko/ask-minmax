There are two broad approaches for differentially private data analysis. The
interactive approach aims at developing customized differentially private
algorithms for various data mining tasks. The non-interactive approach aims at
developing differentially private algorithms that can output a synopsis of the
input dataset, which can then be used to support various data mining tasks. In
this paper we study the tradeoff of interactive vs. non-interactive approaches
and propose a hybrid approach that combines interactive and non-interactive,
using $k$-means clustering as an example. In the hybrid approach to
differentially private $k$-means clustering, one first uses a non-interactive
mechanism to publish a synopsis of the input dataset, then applies the standard
$k$-means clustering algorithm to learn $k$ cluster centroids, and finally uses
an interactive approach to further improve these cluster centroids. We analyze
the error behavior of both non-interactive and interactive approaches and use
such analysis to decide how to allocate privacy budget between the
non-interactive step and the interactive step. Results from extensive
experiments support our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach.
