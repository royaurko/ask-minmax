Despite the increasing need for modeling and implementing Distributed
Databases (DDB), distributed database management systems are still quite far
from helping the designer to directly implement its BDD. Indeed, the
fundamental principle of implementation of a DDB is to make the database appear
as a centralized database, providing series of transparencies, something that
is not provided directly by the current DDBMS. We focus in this work on Oracle
DBMS which, despite its market dominance, offers only a few logical mechanisms
to implement distribution. To remedy this problem, we propose a new
architecture of DDBMS Oracle. The idea is based on extending it by an
intelligent layer that provides: 1) creation of different types of
fragmentation through a GUI for defining different sites geographically
dispersed 2) allocation and replication of DB. The system must automatically
generate SQL scripts for each site of the original configuration.
