Since some years ago, use of Feedback Control Scheduling Algorithm (FCSA) in
the control scheduling co-design of multiprocessor embedded system has
increased. FCSA provides Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of overall system
performance and resource allocation in open and unpredictable environment. FCSA
uses quality control feedback loop to keep CPU utilization under desired
unitization bound by avoiding overloading and deadline miss ratio. Integrated
Fault tolerance (FT) based FCSA design methodology guarantees that the Safety
Critical (SC) tasks will meet their deadlines in the presence of faults.
However, current FCSA design model does not provide the optimal solution with
dynamic load fluctuation. This paper presented a novel methodology of designing
an online adaptive fault tolerant based feedback control algorithm for
multiprocessor embedded systems. This procedure is important for control
scheduling co-design for multiprocessor embedded systems.
