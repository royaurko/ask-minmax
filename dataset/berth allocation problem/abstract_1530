This paper summarizes the outcomes of the 5th International Workshop on
Femtocells held at King's College London, UK, on the 13th and 14th of February,
2012.The workshop hosted cutting-edge presentations about the latest advances
and research challenges in small cell roll-outs and heterogeneous cellular
networks. This paper provides some cutting edge information on the developments
of Self-Organizing Networks (SON) for small cell deployments, as well as
related standardization supports on issues such as carrier aggregation (CA),
Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques, and enhanced Inter-Cell
Interference Coordination (eICIC), etc. Furthermore, some recent efforts on
issues such as energy-saving as well as Machine Learning (ML) techniques on
resource allocation and multi-cell cooperation are described. Finally, current
developments on simulation tools and small cell deployment scenarios are
presented. These topics collectively represent the current trends in small cell
deployments.
