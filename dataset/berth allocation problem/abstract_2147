In the present article we investigate a boundary problem with non-local
conditions for mixed parabolic-hyperbolic type equation with three lines of
type changing. Considered mixed domain contains a rectangle as a parabolic part
and three domains bounded by smooth curves and by type-changing lines as a
hyperbolic part of the mixed domain. We prove the uniqueness applying energy
integral method. The proof of the existence will be done by reducing the
original problem into the system of the second kind Volterra integral
equations.
