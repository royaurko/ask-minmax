We study the problem of deciding whether some PSPACE-complete problems have
models of bounded size. Contrary to problems in NP, models of PSPACE-complete
problems may be exponentially large. However, such models may take polynomial
space in a succinct representation. For example, the models of a QBF are
explicitely represented by and-or trees (which are always of exponential size)
but can be succinctely represented by circuits (which can be polynomial or
exponential). We investigate the complexity of deciding the existence of such
succinct models when a bound on size is given.
