This paper presents a performance evaluation of Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSN) based on Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) over a new simulation
platform developed for this purpose. The simulation platform is built on an
existing network simulator: Global Mobile Information System Simulator
(GloMoSim). It mainly focuses on the accurately modeling of IR-UWB PHYsical
(PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Pulse collision is modeled
according to the used time hopping sequence (THS) and the pulse propagation
delay in order to increase the simulation fidelity. It also includes a
detection and identification application based on a new sensing channel and new
sensor device models. The proposed architecture is generic so it can be reused
for any simulation platform. The performance evaluation is based on one of the
typical WSN applications: local area protection, where sensor nodes are densely
scattered in an access regulated area in order to detect, identify and report
non contributorized accesses to a base station for analysis. Two networks topologies
using different protocol stacks are investigated. Their performance evaluation
is presented in terms of reliability and latency.
