The generalized Busemann-Petty problem asks whether centrally-symmetric
convex bodies having larger volume of all m-dimensional sections necessarily
have larger volume. When m>3 this is known to be false, but the cases m=2,3 are
still open. In those cases, it is shown that when the smaller body's radial
function is a (n-m)-th root of the radial function of a convex body, the answer
to the generalized Busemann-Petty problem is positive (for any larger
star-body). Several immediate corollaries of this observation are also
discussed.
