In cognitive multiple access networks, feedback is an important mechanism to
convey secondary transmitter primary base station (STPB) channel gains from the
primary base station (PBS) to the secondary base station (SBS). This paper
investigates the optimal sum-rate capacity scaling laws for cognitive multiple
access networks in feedback limited communication scenarios. First, an
efficient feedback protocol called $K$-smallest channel gains ($K$-SCGs)
feedback protocol is proposed in which the PBS feeds back the $\K$ smallest out
of $N$ STPB channel gains to the SBS. Second, the sum-rate performance of the
$K$-SCG feedback protocol is studied for three network types when transmission
powers of secondary users (SUs) are optimally allocated. The network types
considered are total-power-and-interference-limited (TPIL),
interference-limited (IL) and individual-power-and-interference-limited (IPIL)
networks. For each network type studied, we provide a sufficient condition on
$\K$ such that the $K$-SCG feedback protocol is {\em asymptotically} optimal in
the sense that the secondary network sum-rate scaling behavior under the
$K$-SCG feedback protocol is the same with that under the full-feedback
protocol. We allow distributions of
secondary-transmitter-secondary-base-station (STSB), and STPB channel power
gains to belong to a fairly general class of distributions called class
$\mathcal{C}$-distributions that includes commonly used fading models.
