We study the existence of positive radially symmetric solution for the
singular $p$-Laplacian Dirichlet problem, $-\bigtriangleup_p u =\lambda
|u|^{p-2} u-\gamma u^{-\alpha}$ where $\lambda>0,\gamma>0$ and, $0<\alpha<1$,
are parameters and $\Omega$, the domain of the equation, is a ball in
$\mathbb{R}^N$. By using some variational methods we show that, if $\lambda$ is
contained in some interval, then the problem has a radially symmetric positive
solution on the ball. Moreover, we obtain a nonexistence result, whenever
$\lambda \leq 0, \gamma<0$ and $\Omega$ is a bounded domain, with smooth
boundary.
