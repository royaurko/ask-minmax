Recently, the impacts of spatiotemporal heterogeneities of human activities
on spreading dynamics have attracted extensive attention. In this paper, to
study heterogeneous response times on information spreading, we focus on the
susceptible-infected spreading dynamics with adjustable power-law response time
distribution based on uncorrelated scale-free networks. We find that the
stronger the heterogeneity of response times is, the faster the information
spreading is in the early and middle stages. Following a given heterogeneity,
the procedure of reducing the correlation between the response times and
degrees of individuals can also accelerate the spreading dynamics in the early
and middle stages. However, the dynamics in the late stage is slightly more
complicated, and there is an optimal value of the full prevalence time changing
with the heterogeneity of response times and the response time-degree
correlation, respectively. The optimal phenomena results from the efficient
allocation of heterogeneous response times.
