Network Utility Maximization (NUM) provides a key conceptual framework to
study reward allocation amongst a collection of users/entities across
disciplines as diverse as economics, law and engineering. In network
engineering, this framework has been particularly insightful towards
understanding how Internet protocols allocate bandwidth, and motivated diverse
research efforts on distributed mechanisms to maximize network utility while
incorporating new relevant constraints, on energy, power, storage, stability,
etc., e.g., for systems ranging from communication networks to the smart-grid.
However when the available resources and/or users' utilities vary over time,
reward allocations will tend to vary, which in turn may have a detrimental
impact on the users' overall satisfaction or quality of experience.
  This paper introduces a generalization of NUM framework which explicitly
incorporates the detrimental impact of temporal variability in a user's
allocated rewards. It explicitly incorporates tradeoffs amongst the mean and
variability in users' reward allocations, as well as fairness. We propose a
simple online algorithm to realize these tradeoffs, which, under stationary
ergodic assumptions, is shown to be asymptotically optimal, i.e., achieves a
long term performance equal to that of an offline algorithm with knowledge of
the future variability in the system. This substantially extends work on NUM to
an interesting class of relevant problems where users/entities are sensitive to
temporal variability in their service or allocated rewards.
