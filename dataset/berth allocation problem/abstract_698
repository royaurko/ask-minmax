We introduce estimators of the variance and weakly consistent estimators of
the asymptotic variance of particle filter approximations. These estimators are
defined using only a single realization of a particle filter, and can therefore
be used to report estimates of Monte Carlo error together with such
approximations. We also provide weakly consistent estimators of individual
terms appearing in the asymptotic variance, again using a single realization of
a particle filter. When the number of particles in the particle filter is
allowed to vary over time, the latter permits approximation of their
asymptotically optimal allocation. Some of the estimators are unbiased, and
hence generalize the i.i.d. sample variance to the non-i.i.d. particle filter
setting.
