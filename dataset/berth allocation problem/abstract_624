In this paper we analyze power and frequency allocation in wireless networks
through potential games. Potential games are used frequently in the literature
for this purpose due to their desirable properties, such as convergence and
stability. However, potential games usually assume massive message passing to
obtain the necessary neighbor information at each user to achieve these
properties. In this paper we show an example of a game where we are able to
characterize the necessary neighbor information in order to show that the game
has a potential function and the properties of potential games. We consider a
network consisting of local access points where the goal of each AP is to
allocate power and frequency to achieve some SINR requirement. We use the
physical SINR model to validate a successful allocation, and show that given a
suitable payoff function the game emits a generalized ordinal potential
function under the assumption of sufficient neighbor information. Through
simulations we evaluate the performance of the proposed game on a large scale
in relation to the amount of information at each AP.
