A_k = {1, a_2, ..., a_k} is an h-basis for n if every positive integer not
exceeding n can be expressed as the sum of no more than h values a_i; an
extremal h-basis A_k is one for which n is as large as possible. Computing such
extremal bases has become known as the Postage Stamp Problem.
  In 1968 Gerd Hofmeister published formulae for solutions to the Postage Stamp
Problem with three denominations (h = 3). This paper presents an alternative
approach developed independently by the contributor 25 years later.
