The Physarum solver is an intuitive mechanism for solving optimisation
problems based on the idea of an electrical network, whereby the conductivity
is reinforced by the current. We show that the Physarum solver obtains the
solution to the linear transshipment problem on a digraph and that the
electrical potential converges to an infinity-harmonic solution of the dual
problem.
