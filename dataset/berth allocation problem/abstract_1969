Multi-scale wave propagation problems are computationally costly to solve by
traditional techniques because the smallest scales must be represented over a
domain determined by the largest scales of the problem. We have developed and
analyzed new numerical methods for multi-scale wave propagation in the
framework of heterogeneous multi-scale method. The numerical methods couples
simulations on macro- and micro-scales for problems with rapidly oscillating
coefficients. We show that the complexity of the new method is significantly
lower than that of traditional techniques with a computational cost that is
essentially independent of the micro-scale. A convergence proof is given and
numerical results are presented for periodic problems in one, two and three
dimensions. The method is also successfully applied to non-periodic problems
and for long time integration where dispersive effects occur.
