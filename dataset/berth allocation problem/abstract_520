Spectrum being a very scarce natural resource of a country has to be
judicially used for the purpose of nation building and the allocation process
to telecom operators should be very transparent and ethical. There are various
ways of how spectrum can be allocated and there is no best way that can be
adopted universally. The market situation, Government policies, competition etc
determine the price of the spectrum and this is purely a regulatory or a
government decision to sell spectrum to telecom companies. The different
allocation methods, their implications with case studies across the globe is
analysed and presented in this paper. The reason why spectrum allocation should
be fair and transparent and the cost should be reasonable is analysed and
described.
