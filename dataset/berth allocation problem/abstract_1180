In this paper, the performance of cognitive transmission under quality of
service (QoS)constraints and interference limitations is studied. Cognitive
secondary users are assumed to initially perform sensing over multiple
frequency bands (or equivalently channels) to detect the activities of primary
users. Subsequently, they perform transmission in a single channel at variable
power and rates depending on the channel sensing decisions and the fading
environment. A state transition model is constructed to model this cognitive
operation. Statistical limitations on the buffer lengths are imposed to take
into account the QoS constraints of the cognitive secondary users. Under such
QoS constraints and limitations on the interference caused to the primary
users, the maximum throughput is identified by finding the effective capacity
of the cognitive radio channel. Optimal power allocation strategies are
obtained and the optimal channel selection criterion is identified. The
intricate interplay between effective capacity, interference and QoS
constraints, channel sensing parameters and reliability, fading, and the number
of available frequency bands is investigated through numerical results.
