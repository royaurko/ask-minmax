Big Bang models of the Universe predict rapid domination by curvature, a
paradox known as the flatness problem. Solutions to this problem usually leave
the Universe exactly flat for every practical purpose. Explaining a nearly but
not exactly flat current Universe is a new problem, which we label the
quasi-flatness problem. We show how theories incorporating time-varying
coupling constants could drive the Universe to a late-time near-flat attractor.
A similar problem may be posed with regards to the cosmological constant
$\Lambda$, the quasi-lambda problem, and we exhibit a solution to this problem
as well.
