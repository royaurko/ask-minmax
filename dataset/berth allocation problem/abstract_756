As more and more information on individuals and companies are placed in the
cloud, concerns are beginning to grow about just how safe an environment it is.
It is better to prevent security threats before they enter into the systems and
there is no way how this can be prevented without knowing where they come from.
The issue of resource allocation and revenue maximization is also equally
important especially when it comes to cloud security. This brings about the
necessity of different modelling techniques including but not limited; security
threat, resource allocation and revenue maximization models. This survey paper
will try to analyse security threats and risk mitigation in cloud computing. It
gives introduction of how viral attack can invade the virtual machines on the
cloud, discusses the top security threats and countermeasures by providing the
viral threat modelling in virtual machines and risk mitigation. Resource
allocation models and revenue maximization techniques are also discussed.
