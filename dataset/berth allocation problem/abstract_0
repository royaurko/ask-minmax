Substitutability, interchangeability and related concepts in Constraint
Programming were introduced approximately twenty years ago and have given rise
to considerable subsequent research. We survey this work, classify, and relate
the different concepts, and indicate directions for future work, in particular
with respect to making connections with research into symmetry breaking. This
paper is a condensed version of a larger work in progress.
