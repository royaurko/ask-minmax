This paper considers a novel approach to scalable multiagent resource
allocation in dynamic settings. We propose an approximate solution in which
each resource consumer is represented by an independent MDP-based agent that
models expected utility using an average model of its expected access to
resources given only limited information about all other agents. A global
auction-based mechanism is proposed for allocations based on expected regret.
We assume truthful bidding and a cooperative coordination mechanism, as we are
considering healthcare scenarios. We illustrate the performance of our
coordinated MDP approach against a Monte-Carlo based planning algorithm
intended for large-scale applications, as well as other approaches suitable for
allocating medical resources. The evaluations show that the global utility
value across all consumer agents is closer to optimal when using our algorithms
under certain time constraints, with low computational cost. As such, we offer
a promising approach for addressing complex resource allocation problems that
arise in healthcare settings.
