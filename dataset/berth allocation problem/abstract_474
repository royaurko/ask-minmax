Social media has been contributing many research areas such as data mining,
recommender systems, time series analysis, etc. However, there are not many
successful applications regarding social media in government agencies. In fact,
lots of governments have social media accounts such as twitter and facebook.
More and more customers are likely to communicate with governments on social
media, causing massive external social media data for governments. This
external data would be bene?ficial for analysing behaviours and real needs of
the customers. Besides this, most governments also have a call centre to help
customers solve their problems. It is not diffi?cult to imagine that the
enquiries on external social media and internal call centre may have some
coupling relationships. The couplings could be helpful for studying customers'
intent and allocating government's limited resources for better service. In
this paper, we mainly focus on analysing the coupling relations between
internal call centre and external public media using time series analysis
methods for Australia Department of Immigration and Border Protec-tion. The
discovered couplings demonstrate that call centre and public media indeed have
correlations, which are signi?cant for understanding customers' behaviours.
