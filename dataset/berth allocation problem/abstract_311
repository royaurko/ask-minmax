In this paper, we investigate optimal resource allocation in a power
beacon-assisted wireless-powered communication network (PB-WPCN), which
consists of a set of hybrid access point (AP)-source pairs and a power beacon
(PB). Each source, which has no embedded power supply, first harvests energy
from its associated AP and/or the PB in the downlink (DL) and then uses the
harvested energy to transmit information to its AP in the uplink (UL). We
consider both cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios based on whether the PB
is cooperative with the APs or not. For the cooperative scenario, we formulate
a social welfare maximization problem to maximize the weighted sum-throughput
of all AP-source pairs, which is subsequently solved by a water-filling based
distributed algorithm. In the non-cooperative scenario, all the APs and the PB
are assumed to be rational and self-interested such that incentives from each
AP are needed for the PB to provide wireless charging service. We then
formulate an auction game and propose an auction based distributed algorithm by
considering the PB as the auctioneer and the APs as the bidders. Finally,
numerical results are performed to validate the convergence of both the
proposed algorithms and demonstrate the impacts of various system parameters.
