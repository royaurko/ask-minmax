In this paper, we consider the problem of joint scheduling and resource
allocation in the OFDMA downlink, with the goal of maximizing an expected
long-term goodput-based utility subject to an instantaneous sum-power
constraint, and where the feedback to the base station consists only of
ACK/NAKs from recently scheduled users. We first establish that the optimal
solution is a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is
impractical to implement. In response, we propose a greedy approach to joint
scheduling and resource allocation that maintains a posterior channel
distribution for every user, and has only polynomial complexity. For
frequency-selective channels with Markov time-variation, we then outline a
recursive method to update the channel posteriors, based on the ACK/NAK
feedback, that is made computationally efficient through the use of particle
filtering. To gauge the performance of our greedy approach relative to that of
the optimal POMDP, we derive a POMDP performance upper-bound. Numerical
experiments show that, for slowly fading channels, the performance of our
greedy scheme is relatively close to the upper bound, and much better than
fixed-power random user scheduling (FP-RUS), despite its relatively low
complexity.
