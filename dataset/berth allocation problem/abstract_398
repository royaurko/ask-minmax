High dimensionality comparable to sample size is common in many statistical
problems. We examine covariance matrix estimation in the asymptotic framework
that the dimensionality $p$ tends to $\infty$ as the sample size $n$ increases.
Motivated by the Arbitrage Pricing Theory in finance, a multi-factor model is
employed to reduce dimensionality and to estimate the covariance matrix. The
factors are observable and the number of factors $K$ is allowed to grow with
$p$. We investigate impact of $p$ and $K$ on the performance of the model-based
covariance matrix estimator. Under mild assumptions, we have established
convergence rates and asymptotic normality of the model-based estimator. Its
performance is compared with that of the sample covariance matrix. We identify
situations under which the factor approach increases performance substantially
or marginally. The impacts of covariance matrix estimation on portfolio
allocation and risk management are studied. The asymptotic results are
supported by a thorough simulation study.
