In medical practice, when more than one treatment option is viable, there is
little systematic use of individual patient characteristics to estimate which
treatment option is most likely to result in a better outcome for the patient.
We introduce a new framework for using statistical models for personalized
medicine. Our framework exploits (1) data from a randomized comparative trial,
and (2) a regression model for the outcome constructed from domain knowledge
and no requirement of correct model specification. We introduce a new
"improvement" measure summarizing the extent to which the model's treatment
allocations improve future subject outcomes on average compared to a
business-as-usual treatment allocation approach. Procedures are provided for
estimating this measure as well as asymptotically valid confidence intervals.
One may also test a null scenario in which the hypothesized model's treatment
allocations are not more useful than the business-as-usual treatment allocation
approach. We demonstrate our method's promise on simulated data as well as on
data from a randomized experiment testing treatments for depression. An
open-source software implementation of our procedures is available within the R
package "Personalized Treatment Evaluator" currently available on CRAN as PTE.
