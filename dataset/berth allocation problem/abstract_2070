For a recent student conference, the contributors developed a day-long design
problem and competition suitable for engineering, mathematics and science
undergraduates. The competition included a cryptography problem, for which a
workshop was run during the conference. This paper describes the competition,
focusing on the cryptography problem and the workshop. Notes from the workshop
and code for the computer programs are made available via the Internet. The
results of a personal self-evaluation (PSE) are described.
