The problem of artificial precision is a major objection to any theory of
vagueness based on real numbers as degrees of truth. Suppose you are willing to
admit that, under sufficiently specified circumstances, a predication of "is
red" receives a unique, exact number from the real unit interval [0,1]. You
should then be committed to explain what is it that determines that value,
settling for instance that my coat is red to degree 0.322 rather than 0.321. In
this note I revisit the problem in the important case of {\L}ukasiewicz
infinite-valued propositional logic that brings to the foreground the role of
maximally consistent theories. I argue that the problem of artificial
precision, as commonly conceived of in the literature, actually conflates two
distinct problems of a very different nature.
