The problem of how to allocate to states the seats in the US House of
Representatives is the most studied instance of what is termed the
`apportionment problem'. We propose a new method of apportionment which is
stochastic, which meets the quota condition, and which is fair in the sense of
expectations. Two sources of systematic unfairness are identified, firstly the
lower bound condition (every state shall receive at least one seat), and
secondly the lower quota condition (every state shall receive at least the
integer part of its quota).
