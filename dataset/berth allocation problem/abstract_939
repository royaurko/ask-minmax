This article presents a unified theory for analysis of components in discrete
data, and compares the methods with techniques such as independent component
analysis, non-negative matrix factorisation and latent Dirichlet allocation.
The main families of algorithms discussed are a variational approximation,
Gibbs sampling, and Rao-Blackwellised Gibbs sampling. Applications are
presented for voting records from the United States Senate for 2003, and for
the Reuters-21578 newswire collection.
