Cooperative transmission can greatly improve communication system performance
by taking advantage of the broadcast nature of wireless channels. Most previous
work on resource allocation for cooperation transmission is based on
centralized control. In this paper, we propose two share auction mechanisms,
the SNR auction and the power auction, to distributively coordinate the
resource allocation among users. We prove the existence, uniqueness and
effectiveness of the auction results. In particular, the SNR auction leads to a
fair resource allocation among users, and the power auction achieves a solution
that is close to the efficient allocation.
