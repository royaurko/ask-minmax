Network coding is an efficient means to improve the spectrum efficiency of
satellite communications. However, its resilience to eavesdropping attacks is
not well understood. This paper studies the confidentiality issue in a
bidirectional satellite network consisting of two mobile users who want to
exchange message via a multibeam satellite using the XOR network coding
protocol. We aim to maximize the sum secrecy rate by designing the optimal
beamforming vector along with optimizing the return and forward link time
allocation. The problem is non-convex, and we find its optimal solution using
semidefinite programming together with a 1-D search. For comparison, we also
solve the sum secrecy rate maximization problem for a conventional reference
scheme without using network coding. Simulation results using realistic system
parameters demonstrate that the bidirectional scheme using network coding
provides considerably higher secrecy rate compared to that of the conventional
scheme.
