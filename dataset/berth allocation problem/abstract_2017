Maximum Common Induced Subgraph (henceforth MCIS) is among the most studied
classical NP-hard problems. MCIS remains NP-hard on many graph classes
including bipartite graphs, planar graphs and $k$-trees. Little is known,
however, about the parameterized complexity of the problem. When parameterized
by the vertex cover number of the input graphs, the problem was recently shown
to be fixed-parameter tractable. Capitalizing on this result, we show that the
problem does not have a polynomial kernel when parameterized by vertex cover
unless $NP \subseteq \mathsf{coNP}/poly$. We also show that \mccis (MCCIS),
which is a variant where the solution must be connected, is also
fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the vertex cover number of
input graphs. Both problems are shown to be W[1]-complete on bipartite graphs
and graphs of girth five and, unless P = NP, they do not belong to the class XP
when parameterized by a bound on the size of the minimum feedback vertex sets
of the input graphs, that is solving them in polynomial time is very unlikely
when this parameter is a constant.
