Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely-used probabilistic topic
modeling paradigm, and recently finds many applications in computer vision and
computational biology. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate batch
algorithm, active belief propagation (ABP), for training LDA. Usually batch LDA
algorithms require repeated scanning of the entire corpus and searching the
complete topic space. To process massive corpora having a large number of
topics, the training iteration of batch LDA algorithms is often inefficient and
time-consuming. To accelerate the training speed, ABP actively scans the subset
of corpus and searches the subset of topic space for topic modeling, therefore
saves enormous training time in each iteration. To ensure accuracy, ABP selects
only those documents and topics that contribute to the largest residuals within
the residual belief propagation (RBP) framework. On four real-world corpora,
ABP performs around $10$ to $100$ times faster than state-of-the-art batch LDA
algorithms with a comparable topic modeling accuracy.
