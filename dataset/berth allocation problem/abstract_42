P2P clusters like the Grid and PlanetLab enable in principle the same
statistical multiplexing efficiency gains for computing as the Internet
provides for networking. The key unsolved problem is resource allocation.
Existing solutions are not economically efficient and require high latency to
acquire resources. We designed and implemented Tycoon, a market based
distributed resource allocation system based on an Auction Share scheduling
algorithm. Preliminary results show that Tycoon achieves low latency and high
fairness while providing incentives for truth-telling on the part of strategic
users.
