Scanning Probe Microscopy allows for extreme resolution down to the atomic
scale. Unfortunately, total scanning range is rather limited, therefore finding
a specific position on the sample is tedious. This is an important limitation
of many Scanning Probe Microscopes, in particular when the sample has to be
removed for some kind of treatment and then re-allocated to characterize the
same position where the previous experiment had been performed. In the present
work we describe two simple and compact sub micron-precision sample holders
that can be easily integrated in to a commercial Scanning Force Microscopy
system. The design is based either on a traditional kinematic mounting or on
self-adjustment of the sample holder and the upper piece of the piezoelectric
scanner as the glue used to assemble the final setup solidifies. With these
sample holders a specific sample position is automatically recovered to within
about 100 nanometers, and thus well within the typical range of a piezoelectric
scanner. Our experimental setup therefore allows ex-situ manipulation of the
sample and SFM imaging of the same region without the aid of an optical
microscope, positioning marks and tedious re-allocation.
