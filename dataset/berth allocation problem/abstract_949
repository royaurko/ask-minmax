A solution function for convex transferable utility games encourages the
grand coalition if no player prefers (in a precise sense defined in the text)
any coalition to the grand coalition. We show that the Shapley value encourages
the grand coalition in all convex games and the tau-value encourages the grand
coalitions in convex games up to three (but not more than three) players.
Solution functions that encourage the grand coalition in convex games always
produce allocations in the core, but the converse is not necessarily true.
