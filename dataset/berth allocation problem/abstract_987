We propose regular expressions to abstractly model and study properties of
resource-aware computations. Inspired by nominal techniques -- as those popular
in process calculi -- we extend classical regular expressions with names (to
model computational resources) and suitable operators (for allocation,
deallocation, scoping of, and freshness conditions on resources). We discuss
classes of such nominal regular expressions, show how such expressions have
natural interpretations in terms of languages over infinite alphabets, and give
Kleene theorems to characterise their formal languages in terms of nominal
automata.
