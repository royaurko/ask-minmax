The article describes a model of chess based on information theory. A
mathematical model of the partial depth scheme is outlined and a formula for
the partial depth added for each ply is calculated from the principles of the
model. An implementation of alpha-beta with partial depth is given. The method
is tested using an experimental strategy having as objective to show the effect
of allocation of a higher amount of search resources on areas of the search
tree with higher information. The search proceeds in the direction of lines
with higher information gain. The effects on search performance of allocating
higher search resources on lines with higher information gain are tested
experimentaly and conclusive results are obtained. In order to isolate the
effects of the partial depth scheme no other heuristic is used.
