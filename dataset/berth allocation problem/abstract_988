In this paper we are proposing a new sorting algorithm, List Sort algorithm,
is based on the dynamic memory allocation. In this research study we have also
shown the comparison of various efficient sorting techniques with List sort.
Due the dynamic nature of the List sort, it becomes much more fast than some
conventional comparison sorting techniques and comparable to Quick Sort and
Merge Sort. List sort takes the advantage of the data which is already sorted
either in ascending order or in descending order.
