A server farm is examined, where a number of servers are used to offer a
service to impatient customers. Every completed request generates a certain
amount of profit, running servers consume electricity for power and cooling,
while waiting customers might leave the system before receiving service if they
experience excessive delays. A dynamic allocation policy aiming at satisfying
the conflicting goals of maximizing the quality of users' experience while
minimizing the cost for the provider is introduced and evaluated. The results
of several experiments are described, showing that the proposed scheme performs
well under different traffic conditions.
