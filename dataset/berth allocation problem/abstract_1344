Multiple hypothesis testing is widely used to evaluate scientific studies
involving statistical tests. However, for many of these tests, p-values are not
available and are thus often approximated using Monte Carlo tests such as
permutation tests or bootstrap tests. This article presents a simple algorithm
based on Thompson Sampling to classify multiple hypotheses in such a situation.
It works with arbitrary multiple testing procedures, in particular with step-up
and step-down procedures. Its main feature is to sequentially allocate Monte
Carlo effort, generating more Monte Carlo samples for tests whose decisions are
so far less certain. A simulation study demonstrates that the new approach
considerably outperforms previously suggested methods.
