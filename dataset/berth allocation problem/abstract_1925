The workflow satisfiability problem (WSP) asks whether there exists an
assignment of contributorized users to the steps in a workflow specification that
satisfies the constraints in the specification. The problem is NP-hard in
general, but several subclasses of the problem are known to be fixed-parameter
tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the number of steps in the specification.
In this paper, we consider the WSP with user-independent counting constraints,
a large class of constraints for which the WSP is known to be FPT. We describe
an efficient implementation of an FPT algorithm for solving this subclass of
the WSP and an experimental evaluation of this algorithm. The algorithm
iteratively generates all equivalence classes of possible partial solutions
until, whenever possible, it finds a complete solution to the problem. We also
provide a reduction from a WSP instance to a pseudo-Boolean SAT instance. We
apply this reduction to the instances used in our experiments and solve the
resulting PB SAT problems using SAT4J, a PB SAT solver. We compare the
performance of our algorithm with that of SAT4J and discuss which of the two
approaches would be more effective in practice.
