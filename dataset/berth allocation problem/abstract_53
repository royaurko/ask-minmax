We consider the problem of rate allocation in a fading Gaussian
multiple-access channel with fixed transmission powers. The goal is to maximize
a general concave utility function of the expected achieved rates of the users.
There are different approaches to this problem in the literature. From an
information theoretic point of view, rates are allocated only by using the
channel state information. The queueing theory approach utilizes the global
queue-length information for rate allocation to guarantee throughput optimality
as well as maximizing a utility function of the rates. In this work, we make a
connection between these two approaches by showing that the information
theoretic capacity region of a multiple-access channel and its stability region
are equivalent. Moreover, our numerical results show that a simple greedy
policy which does not use the queue-length information can outperform
queue-length based policies in terms of convergence rate and fairness.
