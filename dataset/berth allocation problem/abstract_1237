We consider the energy-efficiency of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
systems with constrained received power rather than constrained transmit power.
A Energy-Efficient Water-Filling (EEWF) algorithm that maximizes the ratio of
the transmission rate to the total transmit power has been derived. The EEWF
power allocation policy establishes a trade-off between the transmission rate
and the total transmit power under the total receive power constraint. The
static and the uncorrelated fast fading Rayleigh channels have been considered,
where the maximization is performed on the instantaneous realization of the
channel assuming perfect information at both the transmitter and the receiver
with equal number of antennas. We show, based on Monte Carlo simulations that
the energy-efficiency provided by the EEWF algorithm can be more than an order
of magnitude greater than the energy-efficiency corresponding to capacity
achieving Water-Filling (WF) algorithm. We also show that the energy-efficiency
increases with both the number of antennas and the signal-to-noise ratio. The
corresponding transmission rate also increases but at a slower rate than the
Shannon capacity, while the corresponding total transmit power decreases with
the number of antennas.
