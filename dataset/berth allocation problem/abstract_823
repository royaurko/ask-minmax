We consider a peak-power-limited single-antenna block-stationary Gaussian
fading channel where neither the transmitter nor the receiver knows the channel
state information, but both know the channel statistics. This model subsumes
most previously studied Gaussian fading models. We first compute the asymptotic
channel capacity in the high SNR regime and show that the behavior of channel
capacity depends critically on the channel model. For the special case where
the fading process is symbol-by-symbol stationary, we also reveal a fundamental
interplay between the codeword length, communication rate, and decoding error
probability. Specifically, we show that the codeword length must scale with SNR
in order to guarantee that the communication rate can grow logarithmically with
SNR with bounded decoding error probability, and we find a necessary condition
for the growth rate of the codeword length. We also derive an expression for
the capacity per unit energy. Furthermore, we show that the capacity per unit
energy is achievable using temporal ON-OFF signaling with optimally allocated
ON symbols, where the optimal ON-symbol allocation scheme may depend on the
peak power constraint.
