The method of Raman scattering is used to investigate the cross edge of a
p-dichlorobenzene monocrystal, which was grown up by a Bridgmen method.
Comparison of intensities of additional lines of a spectrum of the lattice
oscillations of certain parts of an edge of a monocrystal with density of these
fields has allowed to relate some lines to presence of vacancies in structure.
