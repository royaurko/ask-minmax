Cooperation in clouds provides a promising technique for 5G wireless
networks, supporting higher data rates. Security of data transmission over
wireless clouds could put constraints on devices; whether to cooperate or not.
Therefore, our aim is to provide analytical framework for the security on the
physical layer of such setup and to define the constraints embodied with
cooperation in small size wireless clouds. In this paper, two legitimate
transmitters Alice and John cooperate to increase the reliable transmission
rate received by their common legitimate receiver Bob, where one eavesdropper,
Eve exists. We provide the achievable secure data transmission rates with
cooperative relaying and when no cooperation exists creating a Multiple Access
Channel (MAC). The paper considers the analysis of different cooperative
scenarios: a cooperative scenario with two relaying devices, a cooperative
scenario without relaying, a non-cooperative scenario, and cooperation from one
side. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal power allocation that
maximizes the achievable secrecy rates for the different set of scenarios where
the implication of cooperation on the achievable secrecy rates was analyzed. We
propose a distributed algorithm that allows the devices to select whether to
cooperate or not and to choose their optimal power allocation based on the
cooperation framework selected. Moreover, we defined distance constraints to
enforce the benefits of cooperation between devices in a wireless cloud.
