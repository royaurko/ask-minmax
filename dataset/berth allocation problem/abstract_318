Impulse Radio Ultra Wide Band (IR-UWB) is a promising technology to address
Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) constraints. However, existing network simulation
tools do not provide a complete WSN simulation architecture, with the IR-UWB
specificities at the PHYsical (PHY) and the Medium Access Control (MAC) layers.
In this paper, we propose a WSN simulation architecture based on the IR-UWB
technique. At the PHY layer, we take into account the pulse collision by
dealing with the pulse propagation delay. We also modelled MAC protocols
specific to IRUWB, for WSN applications. To completely fit the WSN simulation
requirements, we propose a generic and reusable sensor and sensing channel
model. Most of the WSN application performances can be evaluated thanks to the
proposed simulation architecture. The proposed models are implemented on a
scalable and well known network simulator: Global Mobile Information System
Simulator (GloMoSim). However, they can be reused for all other packet based
simulation platforms.
