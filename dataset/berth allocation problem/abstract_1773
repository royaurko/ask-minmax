We consider the inverse scattering problem on the energy interval in three
dimensions. We are focused on stability and instability questions for this
problem. In particular, we prove an exponential instability estimate which
shows optimality of the logarithmic stability result of [Stefanov, 1990] (up to
the value of the exponent).
