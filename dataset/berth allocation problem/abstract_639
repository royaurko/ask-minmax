In this paper, the energy efficiency of multihop relaying over Nakagami-$m$
fading channels is investigated. The "consumption factor" is used as a metric
to evaluate the energy efficiency, and it is derived in closed-form for both
amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying. Then, based on the
obtained expressions, we propose a power allocation strategy maximizing the
consumption factor. In addition, two sub-optimal, low complexity, power
allocation algorithms are proposed and analyzed, and the obtained power
allocation schemes are compared, in terms of energy efficiency as well as other
common performance metrics, to other power allocation schemes from the
literature. Analytical and simulation results confirm the accuracy of our
derivations, and assess the performance gains of the proposed approach.
