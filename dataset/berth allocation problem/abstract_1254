The increasing interest in Semantic Web technologies has led not only to a
rapid growth of semantic data on the Web but also to an increasing number of
backend applications with already more than a trillion triples in some cases.
Confronted with such huge amounts of data and the future growth, existing
state-of-the-art systems for storing RDF and processing SPARQL queries are no
longer sufficient. In this paper, we introduce Partout, a distributed engine
for efficient RDF processing in a cluster of machines. We propose an effective
approach for fragmenting RDF data sets based on a query log, allocating the
fragments to nodes in a cluster, and finding the optimal configuration. Partout
can efficiently handle updates and its query optimizer produces efficient query
execution plans for ad-hoc SPARQL queries. Our experiments show the superiority
of our approach to state-of-the-art approaches for partitioning and distributed
SPARQL query processing.
