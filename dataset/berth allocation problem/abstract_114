We consider the problem of rate and power allocation for a sensor network
under the pairwise distributed source coding constraint. For noiseless
source-terminal channels, we show that the minimum sum rate assignment can be
found by finding a minimum weight arborescence in an appropriately defined
directed graph. For orthogonal noisy source-terminal channels, the minimum sum
power allocation can be found by finding a minimum weight matching forest in a
mixed graph. Numerical results are presented for both cases showing that our
solutions always outperform previously proposed solutions. The gains are
considerable when source correlations are high.
