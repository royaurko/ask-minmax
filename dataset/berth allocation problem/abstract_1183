It is common practice among young astrophysicists these days to invest
research time conservatively in mainstream ideas that have already been
explored extensively in the literature. This tendency is driven by peer
pressure and job market prospects, and is occasionally encouraged by senior
researchers. Although the same phenomenon existed in past decades, it is
alarmingly more prevalent today because a growing fraction of observational and
theoretical projects are pursued in large groups with rigid research agendas.
In addition, the emergence of a ``standard model'' in cosmology (albeit with
unknown dark components) offers secure ``bonds'' for a safe investment of
research time. In this short essay, which summarizes a banquet lecture at a
recent conference, I give examples for both safe and risky topics in
astrophysics (which I split into categories of ``bonds,'' ``stocks,'' and
``venture capital''), and argue that young researchers should always allocate a
small fraction of their academic portfolio to innovative projects with risky
but potentially highly profitable returns. In parallel, selection and promotion
committees must find new strategies for rewarding candidates with creative
thinking.
