We examine the history of cake cutting mechanisms and discuss the efficiency
of their allocations. In the case of piecewise uniform preferences, we define a
game that in the presence of strategic agents has equilibria that are not
dominated by the allocations of any mechanism. We identify that the equilibria
of this game coincide with the allocations of an existing cake cutting
mechanism.
