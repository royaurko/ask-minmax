The growing demand for high-speed data, quality of service (QoS) assurance
and energy efficiency has triggered the evolution of 4G LTE-A networks to 5G
and beyond. Interference is still a major performance bottleneck. This paper
studies the application of physical-layer network coding (PNC), a technique
that exploits interference, in heterogeneous cellular networks. In particular,
we propose a rate-maximising relay selection algorithm for a single cell with
multiple relays based on the decode-and-forward strategy. With nodes
transmitting at different powers, the proposed algorithm adapts the resource
allocation according to the differing link rates and we prove theoretically
that the optimisation problem is log-concave. The proposed technique is shown
to perform significantly better than the widely studied selection-cooperation
technique. We then undertake an experimental study on a software radio platform
of the decoding performance of PNC with unbalanced SNRs in the multiple-access
transmissions. This problem is inherent in cellular networks and it is shown
that with channel coding and decoders based on multiuser detection and
successive interference cancellation, the performance is better with power
imbalance. This paper paves the way for further research in multi-cell PNC,
resource allocation, and the implementation of PNC with higher-order
modulations and advanced coding techniques.
