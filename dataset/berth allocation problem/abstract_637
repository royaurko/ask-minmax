Shaping subscriber traffic based on token bucket filter (TBF) by Internet
service providers (ISPs) results in waste of network resources in shared access
when there are few active subscribers, because it cannot allocate excess
bandwidth in the long term. New traffic control schemes have been recently
proposed to allocate excess bandwidth among active subscribers proportional to
their token generation rates. In this paper we report the current status of our
research on designing flexible yet practical service plans exploiting excess
bandwidth allocation enabled by the new traffic control schemes in shared
access networks, which are attractive to both ISP and its subscribers in terms
of revenue and quality of service (QoS) and serve as a stepping stone to
fully-shared access in the future.
