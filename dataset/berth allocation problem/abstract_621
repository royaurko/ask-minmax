This paper proposes a dynamic bandwidth management algorithm in which more
bandwidth is allocated for higher class users and also higher priority is given
to the videos with higher popularity within a class using agent technology. The
popularity and weight profile of the videos which is used for efficiently
allocating bandwidth is periodically updated by a mobile agent. The proposed
approach allocates more bandwidth for higher class users and gives higher
priority for higher weight videos [popular videos] so that they can be served
with high QoS, reduces the load on the central multimedia server and maximizes
the channel utilization between the neighboring proxy servers and the central
multimedia server and lower video rejection ratio. The simulation results prove
the reduction of load on central multimedia server by load sharing among the
neighboring proxy servers, maximum bandwidth utilization, and more bandwidth
allocation for higher class users.
