We study the generalisation of Baxter's three-colour problem to a random
lattice. Rephrasing the problem as a matrix model problem we discuss the
analyticity structure and the critical behaviour of the resulting matrix model.
Based on a set of loop equations we develop an algorithm which enables us to
solve the three-colour problem recursively
