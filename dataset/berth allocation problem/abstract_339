We consider large scale cost allocation problems and consensus seeking
problems for multiple agents, in which agents are suggested to collaborate in a
distributed algorithm to find a solution. If agents are strategic to minimize
their own individual cost rather than the global social cost, they are endowed
with an incentive not to follow the intended algorithm, unless the tax/subsidy
mechanism is carefully designed. Inspired by the classical
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism and more recent algorithmic mechanism design
theory, we propose a tax mechanism that incentivises agents to faithfully
implement the intended algorithm. In particular, a new notion of asymptotic
incentive compatibility is introduced to characterize a desirable property of
such class of mechanisms. The proposed class of tax mechanisms provides a
sequence of mechanisms that gives agents a diminishing incentive to deviate
from suggested algorithm.
