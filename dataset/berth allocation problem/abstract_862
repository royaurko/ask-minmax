The exponential increase of multimedia services by the mobile users requires
seamless connectivity with cost effective Quality of Service QoS provisioning.
For providing such on-demand QoS, the network needs to utilize the radio
channels among the Mobile Hosts (MHs) effectively. We use vector genetic
algorithm VGA for temporal imploration of sharable channel(s) from the
neighbouring cells to fulfill the needs of a cell. We propose a new micro-level
temporal channel imploration mechanism MiCi, which promptly allocates available
borrowing channel s of the neighbouring cell(s) to the needy cell. The novelty
of MiCi is scalability, high availability, and on demand allocation of the
channels to the desired cells. The performance of our model has been tested by
simulation against a standard FCA scheme as well as a Greedy Borrowing
Heuristic. In all the test cases MiCi shows promising results in comparison to
both the schemes.
