This paper is allocated to CDMA digital images watermarking for ownership
verification and image authentication applications, which for more security,
watermark W is converted to a sequence and then a random binary sequence R of
size n is adopted to encrypt the watermark; where n is the size of the
watermark. This adopting process uses a pseudo-random number generator to
determine the pixel to be used on a given key. After converting the host image
to YUV color space and then wavelet decomposition of Y channel, this adopted
watermark is embedded into the selected subbands coefficients of Y channel
using the correlation properties of additive pseudo- random noise patterns. The
experimental results show that the proposed approach provides extra
imperceptibility, security and robustness against JPEG compression and
different noises attacks compared to the similar proposed methods. Moreover,
the proposed approach has no need of the original image to extract watermarks.
