Wideband spectrum sensing detects the unused spectrum holes for dynamic
spectrum access (DSA). Too high sampling rate is the main problem. Compressive
sensing (CS) can reconstruct sparse signal with much fewer randomized samples
than Nyquist sampling with high probability. Since survey shows that the
monitored signal is sparse in frequency domain, CS can deal with the sampling
burden. Random samples can be obtained by the analog-to-information converter.
Signal recovery can be formulated as an L0 norm minimization and a linear
measurement fitting constraint. In DSA, the static spectrum allocation of
primary radios means the bounds between different types of primary radios are
known in advance. To incorporate this a priori information, we divide the whole
spectrum into subsections according to the spectrum allocation policy. In the
new optimization model, the minimization of the L2 norm of each subsection is
used to encourage the cluster distribution locally, while the L0 norm of the L2
norms is minimized to give sparse distribution globally. Because the L0/L2
optimization is not convex, an iteratively re-weighted L1/L2 optimization is
proposed to approximate it. Simulations demonstrate the proposed method
outperforms others in accuracy, denoising ability, etc.
