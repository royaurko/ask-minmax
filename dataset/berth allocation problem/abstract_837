The objective of this paper is to develop statistical methodology for
planning and evaluating three-armed non-inferiority trials for general
retention of effect hypotheses, where the endpoint of interest may follow any
(regular) parametric distribution family. This generalizes and unifies specific
results for binary, normally and exponentially distributed endpoints. We
propose a Wald-type test procedure for the retention of effect hypothesis
(RET), which assures that the test treatment maintains at least a proportion
$\Delta$ of reference treatment effect compared to placebo. At this, we
distinguish the cases where the variance of the test statistic is estimated
unrestrictedly and restrictedly to the null hypothesis, to improve accuracy of
the nominal level. We present a general valid sample size allocation rule to
achieve optimal power and sample size formulas, which significantly improve
existing ones. Moreover, we propose a general applicable rule of thumb for
sample allocation and give conditions where this rule is theoretically
justified. The presented methodologies are discussed in detail for binary and
for Poisson distributed endpoints by means of two clinical trials in the
treatment of depression and in the treatment of epilepsy, respectively.
