We construct an efficient numerical scheme for solving obstacle problems in
divergence form. The numerical method is based on a reformulation of the
obstacle in terms of an L1-like penalty on the variational problem. The
reformulation is an exact regularizer in the sense that for large (but finite)
penalty parameter, we recover the exact solution. Our formulation is applied to
classical elliptic obstacle problems as well as some related free boundary
problems, for example the two-phase membrane problem and the Hele-Shaw model.
One advantage of the proposed method is that the free boundary inherent in the
obstacle problem arises naturally in our energy minimization without any need
for problem specific or complicated discretization. In addition, our scheme
also works for nonlinear variational inequalities arising from convex
minimization problems.
