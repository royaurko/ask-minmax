The accurate characterization of the business cycles in the nonlinear dynamic
financial and economic systems in the time of globalization represents a
formidable research problem. The central banks and other financial institutions
make their decisions on the minimum capital requirements, countercyclical
capital buffer allocation and capital investments, going from the precise data
on the business cycles. We consider the two possible interaction scenarios,
when there are: the linear interactions, and the non-linear interactions. In
our opinion, the main parameters of the business cycle may deviate during the
business cycle nonlinear interaction with the nonlinear dynamic financial and
economic systems, because of the origination of the nonlinear effects such as
the Four Waves Mixing (FWM), Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS), Stimulated
Raman Scattering (SRS), Carrier Induced Phase Modulation.
