The available data on $J/\Psi$ photoproduction are analyzed in terms of
pomeron exchange, two gluon exchange and photon-gluon fusion models. Allowing
the pomeron-quark interaction to be flavour dependent and introducing the soft
and hard pomerons it is possible to reproduce the data at $\sqrt{s}{>}$10 GeV
and small $|t|$. The two gluon exchange calculations indicate strong
sensitivity to the gluon distribution function. The results obtained with the
most modern MRST2001 and DL PDF reproduce the forward $J/\Psi$ photoproduction
cross section at $\sqrt{s}{>}$10 GeV. The calculations with the photon-gluon
fusion model and with MRST2001 and DL PDF are also in reasonable agreement with
the data on the total $J/\Psi$ photoproduction cross section. We allocate the
$J/\Psi$ photoproduction at low energies and large $|t|$ to the mechanism
different from pomeron or two gluon exchanges. We consider that this might be
axial vector trajectory exchange that couples to the axial form factor of the
nucleon.
