A quantitative modification to keep the number of published papers invariant
under multiple contributorship is suggested. In those cases, fractional allocations
are attributed to each co-contributor with a summation equal to one. These
allocations are tailored on the basis of each contributor contribution. It is
denoted "Tailor Based Allocations (TBA)" for multiple contributorship. Several
protocols to TBA are suggested. The choice of a specific TBA may vary from one
discipline to another. In addition, TBA is applied to the number of citations
of a multiple contributor paper to have also this number conserved. Each contributor gets
only a specific fraction of the total number of citations according to its
fractional paper allocation. The equivalent of the h-index obtained by using
TBA is denoted the gh-index. It yields values which differ drastically from
those given by the h-index. The gh-index departs also from the `h-index
recently proposed by Hirsh to account for multiple contributorship. Contrary to the
h-index, the gh-index is a function of the total number of citations of each
paper. A highly cited paper allows a better allocation for all co-contributors while
a less cited paper contributes essentially to one or two of the co-contributors. The
scheme produces a substantial redistribution of the ranking of scientists in
terms of quantitative records. A few illustrations are provided.
