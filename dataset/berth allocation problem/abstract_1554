This paper introduces a novel technique for access by a cognitive Secondary
User (SU) using best-effort transmission to a spectrum with an incumbent
Primary User (PU), which uses Type-I Hybrid ARQ. The technique leverages the
primary ARQ protocol to perform Interference Cancellation (IC) at the SU
receiver (SUrx). Two IC mechanisms that work in concert are introduced: Forward
IC, where SUrx, after decoding the PU message, cancels its interference in the
(possible) following PU retransmissions of the same message, to improve the SU
throughput; Backward IC, where SUrx performs IC on previous SU transmissions,
whose decoding failed due to severe PU interference. Secondary access policies
are designed that determine the secondary access probability in each state of
the network so as to maximize the average long-term SU throughput by
opportunistically leveraging IC, while causing bounded average long-term PU
throughput degradation and SU power expenditure. It is proved that the optimal
policy prescribes that the SU prioritizes its access in the states where SUrx
knows the PU message, thus enabling IC. An algorithm is provided to optimally
allocate additional secondary access opportunities in the states where the PU
message is unknown. Numerical results are shown to assess the throughput gain
provided by the proposed techniques.
