There has recently been considerable interest in the use of lexically-based
statistical techniques to resolve prepositional phrase attachments. To our
knowledge, however, these investigations have only considered the problem of
attaching the first PP, i.e., in a [V NP PP] configuration. In this paper, we
consider one technique which has been successfully applied to this problem,
backed-off estimation, and demonstrate how it can be extended to deal with the
problem of multiple PP attachment. The multiple PP attachment introduces two
related problems: sparser data (since multiple PPs are naturally rarer), and
greater syntactic ambiguity (more attachment configurations which must be
distinguished). We present and algorithm which solves this problem through
re-use of the relatively rich data obtained from first PP training, in
resolving subsequent PP attachments.
