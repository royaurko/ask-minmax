We propose an algorithm to maximize the instantaneous sum data rate
transmitted by a base station in the downlink of a multiuser multiple-input,
multiple-output system. The transmitter and the receivers may each be equipped
with multiple antennas and each user may receive more than one data stream. We
show that maximizing the sum rate is closely linked to minimizing the product
of mean squared errors (PMSE). The algorithm employs an uplink/downlink duality
to iteratively design transmit-receive linear precoders, decoders, and power
allocations that minimize the PMSE for all data streams under a sum power
constraint. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm
and support the use of the PMSE criterion in maximizing the overall
instantaneous data rate.
