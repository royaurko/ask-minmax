We study the performance region of a general multicell downlink scenario with
multiantenna transmitters, hardware impairments, and low-complexity receivers
that treat interference as noise. The Pareto boundary of this region describes
all efficient resource allocations, but is generally hard to compute. We
propose a novel explicit characterization that gives Pareto optimal transmit
strategies using a set of positive parameters---fewer than in prior work. We
also propose an implicit characterization that requires even fewer parameters
and guarantees to find the Pareto boundary for every choice of parameters, but
at the expense of solving quasi-convex optimization problems. The merits of the
two characterizations are illustrated for interference channels and ideal
network multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO).
