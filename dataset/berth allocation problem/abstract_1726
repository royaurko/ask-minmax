We prove a new outer bound on the rate-distortion region for the
multiterminal source-coding problem. This bound subsumes the best outer bound
in the literature and improves upon it strictly in some cases. The improved
bound enables us to obtain a new, conclusive result for the binary erasure
version of the "CEO problem." The bound recovers many of the converse results
that have been established for special cases of the problem, including the
recent one for the Gaussian version of the CEO problem.
