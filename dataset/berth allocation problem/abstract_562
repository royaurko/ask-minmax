In this work we study energy-efficient transmission for Cognitive Radio (CR)
which opportunistically operates on Primary User's (PU's) channel through
spectrum sensing. Spectrum sensing and compulsory idling (for incumbent
protection) introduce energy-overheads for Secondary User's (SU's) operations,
and thus an appropriate balance between energy consumption in data transmission
and energy-overheads is required. We formulate this problem as a discrete-time
Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which the SU aims at minimizing its average
cost (including both energy consumption and delay cost) to finish a target
traffic payload through an appropriate rate allocation. Based on Certainty
Equivalent Control, we propose a low-complexity rate-adaptation policy that
achieves comparable performance as the optimal policy. With the low-complexity
policy, we quantify the impact of energy-overheads (including the power
consumption for spectrum sensing and compulsory idling) on the SU transmission
strategy. Specifically, the SU rate increases with the increase of
energy-overheads, whose marginal impact, however, diminishes. Moreover, the
marginal impact of energy-overheads is more significant for delay-insensitive
traffic compared to that for delay-sensitive traffic. To mitigate the loss due
to imperfect spectrum sensing, we quantify that the SU decreases (increases)
its rate with a larger mis-detection probability (false alarm probability).
