We study the classic setting of envy-free pricing, in which a single seller
chooses prices for its many items, with the goal of maximizing revenue once the
items are allocated. Despite the large body of work addressing such settings,
most versions of this problem have resisted good approximation factors for
maximizing revenue; this is true even for the classic unit-demand case. In this
paper we study envy-free pricing with unit-demand buyers, but unlike previous
work we focus on large markets: ones in which the demand of each buyer is
infinitesimally small compared to the size of the overall market. We assume
that the buyer valuations for the items they desire have a nice (although
reasonable) structure, i.e., that the aggregate buyer demand has a monotone
hazard rate and that the values of every buyer type come from the same support.
  For such large markets, our main contribution is a 1.88 approximation
algorithm for maximizing revenue, showing that good pricing schemes can be
computed when the number of buyers is large. We also give a (e,2)-bicriteria
algorithm that simultaneously approximates both maximum revenue and welfare,
thus showing that it is possible to obtain both good revenue and welfare at the
same time. We further generalize our results by relaxing some of our
assumptions, and quantify the necessary tradeoffs between revenue and welfare
in our setting. Our results are the first known approximations for large
markets, and crucially rely on new lower bounds which we prove for the
revenue-maximizing prices.
