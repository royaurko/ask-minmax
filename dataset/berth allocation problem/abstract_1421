In this paper, we analyze the spectrum occupancy using different machine
learning techniques. Both supervised techniques (naive Bayesian classifier
(NBC), decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM), linear regression
(LR)) and unsupervised algorithm (hidden markov model (HMM)) are studied to
find the best technique with the highest classification accuracy (CA). A
detailed comparison of the supervised and unsupervised algorithms in terms of
the computational time and classification accuracy is performed. The classified
occupancy status is further utilized to evaluate the probability of secondary
user outage for the future time slots, which can be used by system designers to
define spectrum allocation and spectrum sharing policies. Numerical results
show that SVM is the best algorithm among all the supervised and unsupervised
classifiers. Based on this, we proposed a new SVM algorithm by combining it
with fire fly algorithm (FFA), which is shown to outperform all other
algorithms.
