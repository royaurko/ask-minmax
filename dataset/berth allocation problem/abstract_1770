We consider the Gel'fand inverse problem and continue studies of
[Mandache,2001]. We show that the Mandache-type instability remains valid even
in the case of Dirichlet-to-Neumann map given on the energy intervals. These
instability results show, in particular, that the logarithmic stability
estimates of [Alessandrini,1988], [Novikov,Santacesaria,2010] and especially of
[Novikov,2010] are optimal (up to the value of the exponent).
