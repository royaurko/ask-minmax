Applications in cyber-physical systems are increasingly coupled with online
instruments to perform long running, continuous data processing. Such "always
on" dataflow applications are dynamic, where they need to change the
applications logic and performance at runtime, in response to external
operational needs. Floe is a continuous dataflow framework that is designed to
be adaptive for dynamic applications on Cloud infrastructure. It offers
advanced dataflow patterns like BSP and MapReduce for flexible and holistic
composition of streams and files, and supports dynamic recomposition at runtime
with minimal impact on the execution. Adaptive resource allocation strategies
allow our framework to effectively use elastic Cloud resources to meet varying
data rates. We illustrate the design patterns of Floe by running an integration
pipeline and a tweet clustering application from the Smart Power Grids domain
on a private Eucalyptus Cloud. The responsiveness of our resource adaptation is
validated through simulations for periodic, bursty and random workloads.
