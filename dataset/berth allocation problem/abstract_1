We consider the following problem. Let us fix a finite alphabet A; for any
given d-uple of letter frequencies, how to construct an infinite word u over
the alphabet A satisfying the following conditions: u has linear complexity
function, u is uniformly balanced, the letter frequencies in u are given by the
given d-uple. This paper investigates a construction method for such words
based on the use of mixed multidimensional continued fraction algorithms.
