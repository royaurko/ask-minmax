We examine nonparametric dose-finding designs that use toxicity estimates
based on all available data at each dose allocation decision. We prove that one
such design family, called here "interval design", converges almost surely to
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if the MTD is the only dose level whose
toxicity rate falls within the pre-specified interval around the desired target
rate. Another nonparametric family, called "point design", has a positive
probability of not converging. In a numerical sensitivity study, a diverse
sample of dose-toxicity scenarios was randomly generated. On this sample, the
"interval design" convergence conditions are met far more often than the
conditions for one-parameter design convergence (the Shen-O'Quigley
conditions), suggesting that the interval-design conditions are less
restrictive. Implications of these theoretical and numerical results for
small-sample behavior of the designs, and for future research, are discussed.
