We view channels as the main form of resources in a message-passing
programming paradigm. These channels need to be carefully managed in settings
where resources are scarce. To study this problem, we extend the pi-calculus
with primitives for channel allocation and deallocation and allow channels to
be reused to communicate values of different types. Inevitably, the added
expressiveness increases the possibilities for runtime errors. We define a
substructural type system which combines uniqueness typing and affine typing to
reject these ill-behaved programs.
