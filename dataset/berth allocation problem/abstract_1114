Determining contributions by sub-portfolios or single exposures to
portfolio-wide economic capital for credit risk is an important risk
measurement task. Often economic capital is measured as Value-at-Risk (VaR) of
the portfolio loss distribution. For many of the credit portfolio risk models
used in practice, the VaR contributions then have to be estimated from Monte
Carlo samples. In the context of a partly continuous loss distribution (i.e.
continuous except for a positive point mass on zero), we investigate how to
combine kernel estimation methods with importance sampling to achieve more
efficient (i.e. less volatile) estimation of VaR contributions.
