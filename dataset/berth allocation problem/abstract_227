We investigate the problem of simultaneous transmission and coordination for
a point-to-point communication model. The encoder and decoder choose their
symbols/actions (i.e. channel input and decoder output) in order to transmit
information and to coordinate themselves. This paradigm has promising
repercussions for future decentralized networks. Exploiting the coordination
capabilities, devices can implement decentralized policies that are
coordinated. Exploiting transmission capabilities, devices choose their actions
(power control, the channel allocation) in order to encode additional embedded
information (channel state information, future allocations). The feasible
trade-offs between transmissions and coordinations are characterized using
joint probability distributions over the source and channel symbols. Encoder
and decoder implement a coding scheme such that the empirical frequency of
symbols are close to target joint probability distribution. We characterize the
set of achievable probability distribution for a point-to-point source-channel
model with strictly-causal and causal decoding. Compared to classical coding
results, the coordination requirement induces a stronger information
constraint. We determine optimal trade-offs between transmission and
coordination by maximizing a utility function over the set of achievable
probability distribution.
