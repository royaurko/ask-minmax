In this paper we consider kernelization for problems on d-degenerate graphs,
i.e. graphs such that any subgraph contains a vertex of degree at most $d$.
This graph class generalizes many classes of graphs for which effective
kernelization is known to exist, e.g. planar graphs, H-minor free graphs, and
H-topological-minor free graphs. We show that for several natural problems on
d-degenerate graphs the best known kernelization upper bounds are essentially
tight.
