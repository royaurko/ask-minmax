Identifying and modeling patterns of human activity has important
ramifications in applications ranging from predicting disease spread to
optimizing resource allocation. Because of its relevance and availability,
written correspondence provides a powerful proxy for studying human activity.
One school of thought is that human correspondence is driven by responses to
received correspondence, a view that requires distinct response mechanism to
explain e-mail and letter correspondence observations. Here, we demonstrate
that, like e-mail correspondence, the letter correspondence patterns of 16
writers, performers, politicians, and scientists are well-described by the
circadian cycle, task repetition and changing communication needs. We confirm
the universality of these mechanisms by properly rescaling letter and e-mail
correspondence statistics to reveal their underlying similarity.
