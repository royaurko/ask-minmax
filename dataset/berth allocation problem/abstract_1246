We study algorithms for carrier and rate allocation in cellular systems with
distributed components such as a heterogeneous LTE system with macrocells and
femtocells. Existing work on LTE systems often involves centralized techniques
or requires significant signaling, and is therefore not always applicable in
the presence of femtocells. More distributed CSMA-based algorithms
(carrier-sense multiple access) were developed in the context of 802.11 systems
and have been proven to be utility optimal. However, the proof typically
assumes a single transmission rate on each carrier. Further, it relies on the
CSMA collision detection mechanisms to know whether a transmission is feasible.
  In this paper we present a framework for LTE scheduling that is based on CSMA
techniques. In particular we first prove that CSMA-based algorithms can be
generalized to handle multiple transmission rates in a multi-carrier setting
while maintaining utility optimality. We then show how such an algorithm can be
implemented in a heterogeneous LTE system where the existing Channel Quality
Indication (CQI) mechanism is used to decide transmission feasibility.
