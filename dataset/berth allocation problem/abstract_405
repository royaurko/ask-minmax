Allocation of research funding, as well as promotion and tenure decisions,
are increasingly made using indicators and impact factors drawn from citations
to published work. A debate among scientometricians about proper normalization
of citation counts has resolved with the creation of an Integrated Impact
Indicator (I3) that solves a number of problems found among previously used
indicators. The I3 applies non-parametric statistics using percentiles,
allowing highly-cited papers to be weighted more than less-cited ones. It
further allows unbundling of venues (i.e., journals or databases) at the
article level. Measures at the article level can be re-aggregated in terms of
units of evaluation. At the venue level, the I3 creates a properly weighted
alternative to the journal impact factor. I3 has the added advantage of
enabling and quantifying classifications such as the six percentile rank
classes used by the National Science Board's Science & Engineering Indicators.
