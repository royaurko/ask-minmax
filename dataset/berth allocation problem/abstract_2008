Blind deconvolution is an ubiquitous non-linear inverse problem in
applications like wireless communications and image processing. This problem is
generally ill-posed, and there have been efforts to use sparse models for
regularizing blind deconvolution to promote signal identifiability. Part I of
this two-part paper characterizes the ambiguity space of blind deconvolution
and shows unidentifiability of this inverse problem for almost every pair of
unconstrained input signals. The approach involves lifting the deconvolution
problem to a rank one matrix recovery problem and analyzing the rank two null
space of the resultant linear operator. A measure theoretically tight
(parametric and recursive) representation of the key rank two null space is
stated and proved. This representation is a novel foundational result for
signal and code design strategies promoting identifiability under convolutive
observation models. Part II of this paper analyzes the identifiability of
sparsity constrained blind deconvolution and establishes surprisingly strong
negative results on scaling laws for the sparsity-ambiguity trade-off.
