In this paper we study minimax Aubry-Mather measures and its main properties.
We consider first the discrete time problem and then the continuous time case.
In the discrete time problem we establish existence, study some of the main
properties using duality theory and present some examples. In the continuous
time case, we establish both existence and non-existence results. First we give
some examples that show that in continuous time stationary minimax Mather
measures are either trivial or fail to exist. A more natural definition in
continuous time are $T$-periodic minimax Mather measures. We give a complete
characterization of these measures and discuss several examples.
