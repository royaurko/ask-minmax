Consider an operator equation $F(u)=0$ in a real Hilbert space.
  The problem of solving this equation is ill-posed if the operator $F'(u)$ is
not boundedly invertible, and well-posed otherwise.
  A general method, dynamical systems method (DSM) for solving linear and
nonlinear ill-posed problems in a Hilbert space is presented.
  This method consists of the construction of a nonlinear dynamical system,
that is, a Cauchy problem, which has the following properties:
  1) it has a global solution,
  2) this solution tends to a limit as time tends to infinity,
  3) the limit solves the original linear or non-linear problem. New
convergence and discretization theorems are obtained. Examples of the
applications of this approach are given. The method works for a wide range of
well-posed problems as well.
