Due to mushroom development of wireless devices cognitive radio is used to
resolve the bandwidth utilization and sacristy problem. The crafty usage of
bandwidth in cognitive radio based on error correcting codes is ensured to
accomodate un contributorized user. This study proposes a transmission model by
which a finite sequence of binary cyclic codes constructed by a binary BCH code
of length $n=2^{s}-1$, in which all codes have same error correction capability
and code rate but sequentially increasing code lengths greater than $n$.
Initially all these codes are carrying data of their corresponding primary
users. A transmission pattern is planned in the sprit of interweave model deals
the transmission parameters; modulation scheme, bandwidth and code rate.
Whenever, any of the primary users having mod of transmission, the binary
cyclic code, is not using its allocated bandwidth, the user having its data
built by binary BCH code enter and exploit the free path as a secondary user.
Eventually whenever the primary user with $W$ bandwidth having binary BCH code
for its data transmission, change its status as a secondary user, it just
requires the bandwidth less than $W$.
