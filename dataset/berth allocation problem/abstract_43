We study the effects of the allocation of distributed generation on the
resilience of power grids. We find that an unconstrained allocation and growth
of the distributed generation can drive a power grid beyond its design
parameters. In order to overcome such a problem, we propose a topological
algorithm derived from the field of Complex Networks to allocate distributed
generation sources in an existing power grid.
