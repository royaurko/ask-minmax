This paper presents a soundness and completeness proof for propositional
intuitionistic calculus with respect to the semantics of computability logic.
The latter interprets formulas as interactive computational problems,
formalized as games between a machine and its environment. Intuitionistic
implication is understood as algorithmic reduction in the weakest possible --
and hence most natural -- sense, disjunction and conjunction as
deterministic-choice combinations of problems (disjunction = machine's choice,
conjunction = environment's choice), and "absurd" as a computational problem of
universal strength. See http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html for a
comprehensive online source on computability logic.
