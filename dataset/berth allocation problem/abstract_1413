The rapid increase in data traffic demand has overloaded existing cellular
networks. Planned upgrades in the communication architecture (e.g. LTE), while
helpful, are not expected to suffice to keep up with demand. As a result,
extensive densification through small cells, caching content closer to or even
at the device, and device-to-device (D2D) communications are seen as necessary
components for future heterogeneous cellular networks to withstand the data
crunch. Nevertheless, these options imply new CAPEX and OPEX costs, extensive
backhaul support, contract plan incentives for D2D, and a number of interesting
tradeoffs arise for the operator. In this paper, we propose an analytical model
to explore how much local storage and communication through "edge" nodes could
help offload traffic in various heterogeneous network (HetNet) setups and
levels of user tolerance to delays. We then use this model to optimize the
storage allocation and access mode of different contents as a tradeoff between
user satisfaction and cost to the operator. Finally, we validate our findings
through realistic simulations and show that considerable amounts of traffic can
be offloaded even under moderate densification levels.
