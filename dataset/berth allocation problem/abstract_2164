The $3x+1$ problem, also called the Collatz conjecture, is a very interesting
unsolved mathematical problem related to computer science. This paper
generalized this problem by relaxing the constraints, i.e., generalizing this
deterministic process to non-deterministic process, and set up three models.
This paper analyzed the ergodicity of these models and proved that the
ergodicity of the Collatz process in positive integer field holds, i.e., all
the positive integers can be transformed to 1 by the iterations of the Collatz
function.
