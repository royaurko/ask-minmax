We present an optimized secure multi-antenna transmission approach based on
artificial-noise-aided beamforming, with limited feedback from a desired
single-antenna receiver. To deal with beamformer quantization errors as well as
unknown eavesdropper channel characteristics, our approach is aimed at
maximizing throughput under dual performance constraints - a connection outage
constraint on the desired communication channel and a secrecy outage constraint
to guard against eavesdropping. We propose an adaptive transmission strategy
that judiciously selects the wiretap coding parameters, as well as the power
allocation between the artificial noise and the information signal. This
optimized solution reveals several important differences with respect to
solutions designed previously under the assumption of perfect feedback. We also
investigate the problem of how to most efficiently utilize the feedback bits.
The simulation results indicate that a good design strategy is to use
approximately 20% of these bits to quantize the channel gain information, with
the remainder to quantize the channel direction, and this allocation is largely
insensitive to the secrecy outage constraint imposed. In addition, we find that
8 feedback bits per transmit antenna is sufficient to achieve approximately 90%
of the throughput attainable with perfect feedback.
