We present Keck near-infrared and WIYN optical photometry of a sample of
galaxies detected by near-infrared narrowband imaging in the fields of quasar
metal absorption line systems at z~2.4. Wide separations (0.6-1.6/h Mpc) from
the quasars indicates that they are not directly responsible for the absorption
systems. From the color excess of the galaxies we derived line fluxes, star
formation rates, and equivalent widths. The data are consistent with one source
having an active nucleus and two sources containing regions of star formation.
The blue (R-K) colors for the sources suggest relatively lesser dust content.
We discuss possible projects using current wide-field infrared instruments,
which can cover an order of magnitude greater area with modest allocations of
telescope time.
