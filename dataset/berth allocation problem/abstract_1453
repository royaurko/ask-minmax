The heterogeneity in cellular networks that comprise multiple base stations
types imposes new challenges in network planning and deployment of future
generation of cellular networks. The Radio Resource Management (RRM)
techniques, such as dynamic sharing of the available resources and advanced
user association strategies, determine the overall network capacity and
efficiency. This paper evaluates the downlink performance of a two tier
heterogeneous network (consisting of macro and femto tiers) in terms of rate
distribution, i.e. the percentage of users that achieve certain rate in the
system. The paper specifically addresses the femto tier RRM by randomization of
the allocated resources and the user association process by introducing a
modified SINR association strategy with bias factor for load balancing. Also,
the paper introduces hybrid access control mechanism at the femto tier that
allows the contributorized users of the femtocell, which are part of the Closed
Subscriber Group (CSG) on the femtocell, to achieve higher data rates up to 10
times compared to the other regular users associated in the access.
