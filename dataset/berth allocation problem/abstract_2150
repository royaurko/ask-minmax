In this article we provide a new perspective on the word problem of a group
by using languages of nested words. These were introduced by Alur and
Madhusudan as a way to model programming languages such as HTML. We demonstrate
how a class of nested word languages called visibly pushdown can be used to
study the word problem of virtually free groups in a natural way.
