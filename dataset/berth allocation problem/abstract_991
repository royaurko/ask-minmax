The undercut procedure was presented by Brams et al. [2] as a procedure for
identifying an envy-free allocation when agents have preferences over sets of
objects. They assumed that agents have strict preferences over objects and
their preferences are extended over to sets of objects via the responsive set
extension. We point out some shortcomings of the undercut procedure. We then
simplify the undercut procedure of Brams et al. [2] and show that it works
under a more general condition where agents may express indifference between
objects and they may not necessarily have responsive preferences over sets of
objects. Finally, we show that the procedure works even if agents have unequal
claims.
