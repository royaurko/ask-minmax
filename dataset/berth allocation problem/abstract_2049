We consider the problem of training a binary sequential classifier under an
error rate constraint. It is well known that for known densities, accumulating
the likelihood ratio statistics is time optimal under a fixed error rate
constraint. For the case of unknown densities, we formulate the learning for
sequential detection problem as a constrained density ratio estimation problem.
Specifically, we show that the problem can be posed as a convex optimization
problem using a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space representation for the
log-density ratio function. The proposed binary sequential classifier is tested
on synthetic data set and UC Irvine human activity recognition data set,
together with previous approaches for density ratio estimation. Our empirical
results show that the classifier trained through the proposed technique
achieves smaller average sampling cost than previous classifiers proposed in
the literature for the same error rate.
