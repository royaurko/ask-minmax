In this paper (Part I) and its sequels (Part II and Part III), we analyze the
structure of the space of solutions to the epsilon-Dirichlet problem for the
Yang-Mills equations on the 4-dimensional disk, for small values of the
coupling constant epsilon. These are in one-to-one correspondence with
solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the Yang Mills equations, for small
boundary data. We prove the existence of multiple solutions, and, in
particular, non minimal ones, and establish a Morse Theory for this non-compact
variational problem. In part I, we describe the problem, state the main
theorems and do the first part of the proof. This consists in transforming the
problem into a finite dimensional problem, by seeking solutions that are
approximated by the connected sum of a minimal solution with an instanton, plus
a correction term due to the boundary. An auxiliary equation is introduced that
allows us to solve the problem orthogonally to the tangent space to the space
of approximate solutions. In Part II, the finite dimensional problem is solved
via the Ljusternik-Schirelman theory, and the existence proofs are completed.
In Part III, we prove that the space of gauge equivalence classes of Sobolev
connections with prescribed boundary value is a smooth manifold, as well as
some technical lemmas used in Part I. The methods employed still work when the
4-dimensional disk is replaced by a more general compact manifold with
boundary, and SU(2) is replaced by any compact Lie group.
