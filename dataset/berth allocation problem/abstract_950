Using a method Raman of spectroscopy and considering a non-uniformity of
allocation of vacancies in a monocrystal, it is shown that lines with the small
intensity (caused by presence of vacancies) have a major intensity in the
sample of a larger size than in the sample of a smaller size. Increase of an
intensity of lines at vacancy concentration increase can reveal which lines are
related to presence of vacancies in the sample. For a p-dichlorobenzene, it is
lines of a small intensity in a spectrum of the lattice oscillations in the
field of 70 cm^{-1}.
