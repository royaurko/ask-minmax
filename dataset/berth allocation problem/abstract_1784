This paper discusses stochastic models for predicting the long-time behavior
of the trajectories of orbits of the 3x+1 problem and, for comparison, the 5x+1
problem. The stochastic models are rigorously analyzable, and yield heuristic
predictions (conjectures) for the behavior of 3x+1 orbits and 5x+1 orbits.
