This paper provides a classification of real scheduling problems. Various
ways have been examined and described on the problem. Scheduling problem faces
a tremendous challenges and difficulties in order to meet the preferences of
the consumer. Dealing with scheduling problem is complicated, inefficient and
time-consuming. This study aims to develop a mathematical model for scheduling
the operating theatre during peak and off peak time. Scheduling problem is a
well known optimization problem and the goal is to find the best possible
optimal solution. In this paper, we used integer linear programming technique
for scheduling problem in a high level of synthesis. In addition, time and
resource constrained scheduling was used. An optimal result was fully obtained
by using the software GLPK/AMPL. This model can be adopted to solve other
scheduling problems, such as the Lecture Theatre, Cinemas and Work Shift.
