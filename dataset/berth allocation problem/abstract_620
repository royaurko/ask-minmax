In this contribution we present a decentralized power allocation algorithm
for the uplink interleave division multiple access (IDMA) channel. Within the
proposed optimal strategy for power allocation, each user aims at selfishly
maximizing its own utility function. An iterative chip by chip (CBC) decoder at
the receiver and a rational selfish behavior of all the users according to a
classical game-theoretical framework are the underlying assumptions of this
work. This approach leads to a power allocation based on a channel inversion
policy where the optimal power level is set locally at each terminal based on
the knowledge of its own channel realization, the noise level at the receiver
and the number of active users in the network.
