In this paper we present the core of LoCo, a logic-based high-level
representation language for expressing configuration problems. LoCo shall allow
to model these problems in an intuitive and declarative way, the dynamic
aspects of configuration notwithstanding. Our logic enforces that
configurations contain only finitely many components and reasoning can be
reduced to the task of model construction.
