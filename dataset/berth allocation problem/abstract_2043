The three-body problem, which describes three masses interacting through
Newtonian gravity without any restrictions imposed on the initial positions and
velocities of these masses, has attracted the attention of many scientists for
more than 300 years. In this paper, we present a review of the three-body
problem in the context of both historical and modern developments. We describe
the general and restricted (circular and elliptic) three-body problems,
different analytical and numerical methods of finding solutions, methods for
performing stability analysis, search for periodic orbits and resonances, and
application of the results to some interesting astronomical and space dynamical
settings. We also provide a brief presentation of the general and restricted
relativistic three-body problems, and discuss their astronomical applications.
