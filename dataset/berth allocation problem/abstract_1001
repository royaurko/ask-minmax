We apply entropy agglomeration (EA), a recently introduced algorithm, to
cluster the words of a literary text. EA is a greedy agglomerative procedure
that minimizes projection entropy (PE), a function that can quantify the
segmentedness of an element set. To apply it, the text is reduced to a feature
allocation, a combinatorial object to represent the word occurences in the
text's paragraphs. The experiment results demonstrate that EA, despite its
reduction and simplicity, is useful in capturing significant relationships
among the words in the text. This procedure was implemented in Python and
published as a free software: REBUS.
