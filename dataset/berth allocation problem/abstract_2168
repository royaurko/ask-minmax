Blind system identification is known to be an ill-posed problem and without
further assumptions, no unique solution is at hand. In this contribution, we
are concerned with the task of identifying an ARX model from only output
measurements. We phrase this as a constrained rank minimization problem and
present a relaxed convex formulation to approximate its solution. To make the
problem well posed we assume that the sought input lies in some known linear
subspace.
