Due to the fundamental tradeoffs, achieving spectrum efficiency and energy
efficiency are two contending design challenges for the future wireless
networks. However, applying radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) in a
cognitive radio system could potentially circumvent this tradeoff, resulting in
a secondary system with limitless power supply and meaningful achievable
information rates. This paper proposes an online solution for the optimal time
allocation (time sharing) between the EH phase and the information transmission
(IT) phase in an underlay cognitive radio system, which harvests the RF energy
originating from the primary system. The proposed online solution maximizes the
average achievable rate of the cognitive radio system, subject to the
$\varepsilon$-percentile protection criteria for the primary system. The
optimal time sharing achieves significant gains compared to equal time
allocation between the EH and IT phases.
