The advancements in wireless mesh networks (WMN), and the surge in
multi-radio multi-channel (MRMC) WMN deployments have spawned a multitude of
network performance issues. These issues are intricately linked to the adverse
impact of endemic interference. Thus, interference mitigation is a primary
design objective in WMNs. Interference alleviation is often effected through
efficient channel allocation (CA) schemes which fully utilize the potential of
MRMC environment and also restrain the detrimental impact of interference.
However, numerous CA schemes have been proposed in research literature and
there is a lack of CA performance prediction techniques which could assist in
choosing a suitable CA for a given WMN. In this work, we propose a reliable
interference estimation and CA performance prediction approach. We demonstrate
its efficacy by substantiating the CA performance predictions for a given WMN
with experimental data obtained through rigorous simulations on an ns-3 802.11g
environment.
