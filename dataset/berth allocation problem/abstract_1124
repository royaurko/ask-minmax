This paper presents a summary of the first 10 years of operating the
Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) in queue mode. The scheduling can be quite complex
but has worked effectively for obtaining the most science possible with this
uniquely designed telescope. The queue must handle dozens of separate
scientific programs, the involvement of a number of institutions with
individual Telescope Allocation Committees as well as engineering and
instrument commissioning. We have continuously revised our queue operations as
we have learned from experience. The flexibility of the queue and the
simultaneous availability of three instruments, along with a staff trained for
all aspects of telescope and instrumentation operation, have allowed optimum
use to be made of variable weather conditions and have proven to be especially
effective at accommodating targets of opportunity and engineering tasks. In
this paper we review the methodology of the HET queue along with its strengths
and weaknesses.
