Topic modeling based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) has been a
framework of choice to deal with multimodal data, such as in image annotation
tasks. Another popular approach to model the multimodal data is through deep
neural networks, such as the deep Boltzmann machine (DBM). Recently, a new type
of topic model called the Document Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator
(DocNADE) was proposed and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance for text
document modeling. In this work, we show how to successfully apply and extend
this model to multimodal data, such as simultaneous image classification and
annotation. First, we propose SupDocNADE, a supervised extension of DocNADE,
that increases the discriminative power of the learned hidden topic features
and show how to employ it to learn a joint representation from image visual
words, annotation words and class label information. We test our model on the
LabelMe and UIUC-Sports data sets and show that it compares favorably to other
topic models. Second, we propose a deep extension of our model and provide an
efficient way of training the deep model. Experimental results show that our
deep model outperforms its shallow version and reaches state-of-the-art
performance on the Multimedia Information Retrieval (MIR) Flickr data set.
