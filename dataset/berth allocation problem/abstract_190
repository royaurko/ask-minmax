Research interest in Grid computing has grown significantly over the past
five years. Management of distributed resources is one of the key issues in
Grid computing. Central to management of resources is the effectiveness of
resource allocation as it determines the overall utility of the system. The
current approaches to superscheduling in a grid environment are non-coordinated
since application level schedulers or brokers make scheduling decisions
independently of the others in the system. Clearly, this can exacerbate the
load sharing and utilization problems of distributed resources due to
suboptimal schedules that are likely to occur. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a mechanism for coordinated sharing of distributed clusters based on
computational economy. The resulting environment, called
\emph{Grid-Federation}, allows the transparent use of resources from the
federation when local resources are insufficient to meet its users'
requirements. The use of computational economy methodology in coordinating
resource allocation not only facilitates the QoS based scheduling, but also
enhances utility delivered by resources.
