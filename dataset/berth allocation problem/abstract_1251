In this paper we introduced Modified Sized-based Queue Management as a
dropping scheme that aims to fairly prioritize and allocate more service to
VoIP traffic over bulk data like FTP as the former one usually has small packet
size with less impact to the network congestion. In the same time, we want to
guarantee that this prioritization is fair enough for both traffic types. On
the other hand we study the total link delay over the congestive link with the
attempt to alleviate this congestion as much as possible at the by function of
early congestion notification. Our M-SQM scheme has been evaluated with NS2
experiments to measure the packets received from both and total link-delay for
different traffic. The performance evaluation results of M-SQM have been
validated and graphically compared with the performance of other three legacy
AQMs (RED, RIO, and PI). It is depicted that our M-SQM outperformed these AQMs
in providing QoS level of service differentiation.
