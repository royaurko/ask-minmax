Inspired by the unsupervised learning or self-organization in the machine
learning context, here we attempt to draw `learning curve' for the collective
behavior of job-seeking `zero-intelligence' labors in successive job-hunting
processes. Our labor market is supposed to be opened especially for university
graduates in Japan, where the students have several successive chances
n=0,1,2,... to obtain their positions within an academic (business) year. In
this sense, the `cumulative unemployment rate' in our model system is regarded
as an error-measurement in the collective intelligence of students, and the
job-hunting stage n-dependence of the error constructs a learning curve. In our
simple toy-model of probabilistic labor market, the diversity of students'
behavior is built-in by means of the Jaynes-Shannon's MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy)
principle. Then, we discuss the speed of convergence for the error-measurement,
where we consider a scenario in which the students do not use any information
about the result of job-hunting processes in the previous stage. Our approach
enables us to examine the existence of the condition on which macroscopic
quantity, say, `stage-wise unemployment rate' becomes `scale-invariant' in the
sense that it does not depend on the job-hunting stage n. From the macroscopic
view point, the problem could be regarded as a human resource allocation.
