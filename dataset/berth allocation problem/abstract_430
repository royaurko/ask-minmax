We study opportunistic interference management when there is bursty
interference in parallel 2-user linear deterministic interference channels. A
degraded message set communication problem is formulated to exploit the
burstiness of interference in M subcarriers allocated to each user. We focus on
symmetric rate requirements based on the number of interfered subcarriers
rather than the exact set of interfered subcarriers. Inner bounds are obtained
using erasure coding, signal-scale alignment and Han-Kobayashi coding strategy.
Tight outer bounds for a variety of regimes are obtained using the El
Gamal-Costa injective interference channel bounds and a sliding window subset
entropy inequality. The result demonstrates an application of techniques from
multilevel diversity coding to interference channels. We also conjecture outer
bounds indicating the sub-optimality of erasure coding across subcarriers in
certain regimes.
