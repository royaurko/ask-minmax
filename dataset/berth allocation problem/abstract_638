In part I of this paper, a distributed and a centralized architecture for an
optimal radio resource allocation aware of the traffic delay-tolerance nature,
user subscription type, and application usage variations were developed. In the
current article, a transmission overhead analysis of the aforementioned
distributed and a centralized architectures is investigated and it is proved
that the centralized scheme endures a significantly lower transmission overhead
than does the distributed approach. Furthermore, the lower bounds of the
transmission overhead for both the centralized and the distributed
architectures are derived. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of the resource
allocation procedures of the aforesaid centralized and distributed
architectures to the changes in the number of users in the system is presented.
Besides, a sensitivity analysis of the centralized and distributed approaches
to the temporal changes in application usages are investigated. Ultimately, the
transmission overhead and sensitivity relevant statements are verified through
appropriate simulations. And last but not the least, a real-world
implementation of the resource allocation methods developed in Part I is
provided.
