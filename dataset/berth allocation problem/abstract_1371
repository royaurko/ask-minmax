We present a foveated object detector (FOD) as a biologically-inspired
alternative to the sliding window (SW) approach which is the dominant method of
search in computer vision object detection. Similar to the human visual system,
the FOD has higher resolution at the fovea and lower resolution at the visual
periphery. Consequently, more computational resources are allocated at the
fovea and relatively fewer at the periphery. The FOD processes the entire
scene, uses retino-specific object detection classifiers to guide eye
movements, aligns its fovea with regions of interest in the input image and
integrates observations across multiple fixations. Our approach combines modern
object detectors from computer vision with a recent model of peripheral pooling
regions found at the V1 layer of the human visual system. We assessed various
eye movement strategies on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and show that the FOD
performs on par with the SW detector while bringing significant computational
cost savings.
