Cognitive radio (CR) systems allow opportunistic, secondary users (SUs) to
access portions of the spectrum that are unused by the network's licensed
primary users (PUs), provided that the induced interference does not compromise
the primary users' performance guarantees. To account for interference
constraints of this type, we consider a flexible spectrum access pricing scheme
that charges secondary users based on the interference that they cause to the
system's primary users (individually, globally, or both), and we examine how
secondary users can maximize their achievable transmission rate in this
setting. We show that the resulting non-cooperative game admits a unique Nash
equilibrium under very mild assumptions on the pricing mechanism employed by
the network operator, and under both static and ergodic (fast-fading) channel
conditions. In addition, we derive a dynamic power allocation policy that
converges to equilibrium within a few iterations (even for large numbers of
users), and which relies only on local signal-to-interference-and-noise
measurements; importantly, the proposed algorithm retains its convergence
properties even in the ergodic channel regime, despite the inherent
stochasticity thereof. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive
numerical simulations which illustrate the performance and scalability
properties of the proposed pricing scheme under realistic network conditions.
