We analyze a distributed system where n nodes called boxes store a large set
of videos and collaborate to serve simultaneously n videos or less. We explore
under which conditions such a system can be scalable while serving any sequence
of demands. We model this problem through a combination of two algorithms: a
video allocation algorithm and a connection scheduling algorithm. The latter
plays against an adversary that incrementally proposes video requests.
