This article is concerned with an optimal control problem derived by
mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equations, where the drift
coefficients of the observation equations are linear with respect to the
states. The control problem has potential applications in mathematical finance,
e.g. asset-liability management problem, recursive utility optimality problem.
Using a backward separation method with a decomposition technique, two
optimality conditions and two coupled forward-backward filter are derived. A
linear-quadratic optimal control problem is studied. Moreover, closed-form
optimal solutions are obtained.
