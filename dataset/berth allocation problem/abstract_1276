We develop from basic economic principles a continuous-time model for a large
investor who trades with a finite number of market makers at their utility
indifference prices. In this model, the market makers compete with their quotes
for the investor's orders and trade among themselves to attain Pareto optimal
allocations. We first consider the case of simple strategies and then, in
analogy to the construction of stochastic integrals, investigate the transition
to general continuous dynamics. As a result, we show that the model's evolution
can be described by a nonlinear stochastic differential equation for the market
makers' expected utilities.
