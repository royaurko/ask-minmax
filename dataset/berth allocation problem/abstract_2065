This paper was presented at the Institute for Mathematics and its
Applications workshop "Inverse problems in wave propagation" and will appear in
the series IMA volumes (Springer). A brief overview of applications of
inversions within astronomy is presented and also an inventory of techniques
commonly in use. Most of this paper is focussed on the method of Subtractive
Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA) which is an adaptation of the Backus and
Gilbert method. This method was originally developed for use in helioseismology
where the Backus and Gilbert method is computationally too slow. Since then it
has also been applied to the problem of reverberation mapping of active
galactic nuclei and the differences between this inverse problem and the ones
of helioseismology are also discussed.
