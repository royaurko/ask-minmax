In this paper, we study the problem of estimating uniformly well the mean
values of several distributions given a finite budget of samples. If the
variance of the distributions were known, one could design an optimal sampling
strategy by collecting a number of independent samples per distribution that is
proportional to their variance. However, in the more realistic case where the
distributions are not known in advance, one needs to design adaptive sampling
strategies in order to select which distribution to sample from according to
the previously observed samples. We describe two strategies based on pulling
the distributions a number of times that is proportional to a high-probability
upper-confidence-bound on their variance (built from previous observed samples)
and report a finite-sample performance analysis on the excess estimation error
compared to the optimal allocation. We show that the performance of these
allocation strategies depends not only on the variances but also on the full
shape of the distributions.
