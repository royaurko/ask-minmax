In this paper we examine the problem of designing and allocating transmission
sequences to users in a mobile ad hoc network that has no spatial boundary. A
basic tenet of the transmission sequence approach for addressing media access
control is that under normal operating conditions, there is no feedback
triggered re-transmission. This obviously is a major departure from the
Slotted-ALOHA or CSMA type approaches. While these solutions enjoy excellent
throughput performance, a fundamental drawback is that they are based on
feedback information. For systems without naturally defined central controller
that can play the role of a base station, the task of providing feedback
information could easily become unmanageable. This highlights the advantage of
the feedback-free approach. A second advantage is the ability to handle
unlimited spatial coverage. We propose in this paper a concept for media access
control that is akin to frequency reuse. However, instead of reusing frequency,
the new approach allows transmission sequences be reused. A study of the
transmission sequence approach against other approaches is conducted by
comparing the minimal frame lengths that can guarantee the existence of
conflict-free transmissions.
