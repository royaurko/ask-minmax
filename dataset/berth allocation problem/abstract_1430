We describe a technique for drawing values from discrete distributions, such
as sampling from the random variables of a mixture model, that avoids computing
a complete table of partial sums of the relative probabilities. A table of
alternate ("butterfly-patterned") form is faster to compute, making better use
of coalesced memory accesses. From this table, complete partial sums are
computed on the fly during a binary search. Measurements using an NVIDIA Titan
Black GPU show that for a sufficiently large number of clusters or topics (K >
200), this technique alone more than doubles the speed of a latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA) application already highly tuned for GPU execution.
