Many advertisers buy advertisements (ads) on the Internet or on traditional
media and seek simple, online mechanisms to reserve ad slots in advance. Media
publishers represent a vast and varying inventory, and they too seek automatic,
online mechanisms for pricing and allocating such reservations. In this paper,
we present and study a simple model for auctioning such ad slots in advance.
Bidders arrive sequentially and report which slots they are interested in. The
seller must decide immediately whether or not to grant a reservation. Our model
allows a seller to accept reservations, but possibly cancel the allocations
later and pay the bidder a cancellation compensation (bump payment). Our main
result is an online mechanism to derive prices and bump payments that is
efficient to implement. This mechanism has many desirable properties. It is
individually rational; winners have an incentive to be honest and bidding one's
true value dominates any lower bid. Our mechanism's efficiency is within a
constant fraction of the a posteriori optimally efficient solution. Its revenue
is within a constant fraction of the a posteriori revenue of the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism. Our results make no assumptions about the
order of arrival of bids or the value distribution of bidders and still hold if
the items for sale are elements of a matroid, a more general setting than slot
allocation.
