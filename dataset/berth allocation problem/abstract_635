This paper focuses on an essential task of the enhanced NodeB eNodeB element
in LTE architecture, the Radio Resource Manager RRM, which aims to accept or
reject requests for connection to the network based on some constraints and
ensuring optimal distribution of radio resources between Users Equipments UEs.
Its main functionalities include Admission Control AC and Packet Scheduling PS.
This paper will center mainly on the PS part of the RRM task, which performs
the radio resource allocation in both uplink and downlink directions. Several
approaches and algorithms have been proposed in the literature to address this
need ie : allocate resources efficiently, the diversity and multitude of
algorithms is related to the factors considered for the optimal management of
radio resource, specifically, the traffic type and the QoS Quality of Service
requested by the UE. In this article, an art's state of the radio resource
allocation strategies and a detailed study of several scheduling algorithms
proposed for LTE (uplink and downlink) are made. Therefore, we offer our
evaluation and criticism.
