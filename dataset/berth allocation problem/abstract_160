An S-adic expansion of an infinite word is a way of writing it as the limit
of an infinite product of substitutions (i.e., morphisms of a free monoid).
Such a description is related to continued fraction expansions of numbers and
vectors. A fundamental example of this relation is between Sturmian sequences
and regular continued fractions. We study S-adic words from different
perspectives, namely word combinatorics, ergodic theory, and Diophantine
approximation, by stressing the parallel with continued fraction expansions.
