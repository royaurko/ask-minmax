Biased-coin designs are used in clinical trials to allocate treatments with
some randomness while maintaining approximately equal allocation. More recent
rules are compared with Efron's [Biometrika 58 (1971) 403-417] biased-coin rule
and extended to allow balance over covariates. The main properties are loss of
information, due to imbalance, and selection bias. Theoretical results, mostly
large sample, are assembled and assessed by small-sample simulations. The
properties of the rules fall into three clear categories. A Bayesian rule is
shown to have appealing properties; at the cost of slight imbalance, bias is
virtually eliminated for large samples.
