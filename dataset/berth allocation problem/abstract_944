We introduce the concept of virtual volatility. This simple but new measure
shows how to quantify the uncertainty in the forecast of the drift component of
a random walk. The virtual volatility also is a useful tool in understanding
the stochastic process for a given portfolio. In particular, and as an example,
we were able to identify mean reversion effect in our portfolio. Finally, we
briefly discuss the potential practical effect of the virtual volatility on an
investor asset allocation strategy.
