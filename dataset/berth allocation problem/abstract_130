We consider the problem of decentralized detection where peripheral nodes
make noisy observations of a phenomenon and send quantized information about
the phenomenon towards a fusion center over a sum-rate constrained multiple
access channel. The fusion center then makes a decision about the state of the
phenomenon based on the aggregate received data. Using the Chernoff information
as a performance metric, Chamberland and Veeravalli previously studied the
structure of optimal rate allocation strategies for this scenario under the
assumption of an unlimited number of sensors. Our key contribution is to extend
these result to the case where there is a constraint on the maximum number of
active sensors. In particular, we find sufficient conditions under which the
uniform rate allocation is an optimal strategy, and then numerically verify
that these conditions are satisfied for some relevant sensor design rules under
a Gaussian observation model.
