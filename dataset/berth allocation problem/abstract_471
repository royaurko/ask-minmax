Interference alignment (IA) has recently emerged as a promising interference
mitigation technique for interference networks. In this letter, we focus on the
IA non-iterative transceiver design problem in a multiple-input-multiple-output
interfering broadcast channel (MIMO-IBC), and observed that there is previously
unexploited flexibility in different permutations of user ordering. By choosing
a good user ordering for a pre-determined IA inter-channel-interference
allocation, an improved transceiver design can be accomplished. In order to
achieve a more practical performance-complexity tradeoff, a suboptimal user
ordering algorithm is proposed. Simulation shows the proposed suboptimal user
ordering algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance compared to the optimal
ordering while exhibiting only moderate computational complexity.
