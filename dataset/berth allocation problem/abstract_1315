We develop two analytic approaches to solve D-optimal approximate designs
under generalized linear models. The first approach provides analytic D-optimal
allocations for generalized linear models with two factors, which include as a
special case the $2^2$ main-effects model considered by Yang, Mandal and
Majumdar (2012). The second approach leads to explicit solutions for a class of
generalized linear models with more than two factors. With the aid of the
analytic solutions, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which
a D-optimal design with two quantitative factors could be constructed on the
boundary points only. It bridges the gap between D-optimal factorial designs
and D-optimal designs with continuous factors.
