We exhibit incentive compatible multi-unit auctions that are not affine
maximizers (i.e., are not of the VCG family) and yet approximate the social
welfare to within a factor of $1+\epsilon$. For the case of two-item two-bidder
auctions we show that these auctions, termed Triage auctions, are the only
scalable ones that give an approximation factor better than 2. "Scalable" means
that the allocation does not depend on the units in which the valuations are
measured. We deduce from this that any scalable computationally-efficient
incentive-compatible auction for $m$ items and $n \ge 2$ bidders cannot
approximate the social welfare to within a factor better than 2. This is in
contrast to arbitrarily good approximations that can be reached under
computational constraints alone, and in contrast to the fact that the optimal
social welfare can be obtained under incentive constraints alone.
