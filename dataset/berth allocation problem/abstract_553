We consider a communication system where two transmitters wish to exchange
information through a half-duplex relay in the middle. The channels between the
transmitters and the relay have asymmetric channel gains. More specifically,
the channels are assumed to be synchronized with complex inputs and complex
fading coefficients with an average power constraint on the inputs to the
channels. The noise at the receivers have the same power spectral density and
are assumed to be white and Gaussian. We restrict our attention to transmission
schemes where information from the two nodes are simultaneously sent to the
relay during a medium access phase followed by a broadcast phase where the
relay broadcasts information to both the nodes. An upper bound on the capacity
for the two phase protocol under a sum power constraint on the transmit power
from all the nodes is obtained as a solution to a convex optimization problem.
We show that a scheme using channel inversion with lattice decoding can obtain
a rate a small constant 0.09 bits from the upper bound at high signal-to-noise
ratios. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can perform very close
to the upper bound.
