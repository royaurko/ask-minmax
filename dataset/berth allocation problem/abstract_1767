In this paper, we describe the solution for a problem dealing with definite
properties of binary sequences. This problem, proposed by Xavier Grandsart in
the form of a mathematical contest, has been solved also by Maher Younan, Ph.D.
student of Theoretical Physics at the University of Geneva, and Pierre Deligne,
professor at Princeton and Field Medals, using different approaches with
respect to the one presented in this work.
