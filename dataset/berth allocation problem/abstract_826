Response-adaptive designs have been extensively studied and used in clinical
trials. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive study of response-adaptive
designs that include covariates, despite their importance in clinical
experiments. Because the allocation scheme and the estimation of parameters are
affected by both the responses and the covariates, covariate-adjusted
response-adaptive (CARA) designs are very complex to formulate. In this paper,
we overcome the technical hurdles and lay out a framework for general CARA
designs for the allocation of subjects to $K (\geq 2)$ treatments. The
asymptotic properties are studied under certain widely satisfied conditions.
The proposed CARA designs can be applied to generalized linear models. Two
important special cases, the linear model and the logistic regression model,
are considered in detail.
