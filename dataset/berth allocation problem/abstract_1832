A map from the initial conditions to the values of the function and its first
spatial derivative evaluated at the interface is constructed for the heat
equation on finite and infinite domains with $n$ interfaces. The existence of
this map allows changing the problem at hand from an interface problem to a
boundary value problem which allows for an alternative to the approach of
finding a closed-form solution to the interface problem.
