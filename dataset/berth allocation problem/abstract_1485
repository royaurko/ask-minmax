Transmission over wireless fading channels under quality of service (QoS)
constraints is studied when only the receiver has channel side information.
Being unaware of the channel conditions, transmitter is assumed to send the
information at a fixed rate. Under these assumptions, a two-state (ON-OFF)
transmission model is adopted, where information is transmitted reliably at a
fixed rate in the ON state while no reliable transmission occurs in the OFF
state. QoS limitations are imposed as constraints on buffer violation
probabilities, and effective capacity formulation is used to identify the
maximum throughput that a wireless channel can sustain while satisfying
statistical QoS constraints. Energy efficiency is investigated by obtaining the
bit energy required at zero spectral efficiency and the wideband slope in both
wideband and low-power regimes assuming that the receiver has perfect channel
side information (CSI). In both wideband and low-power regimes, the increased
energy requirements due to the presence of QoS constraints are quantified.
Comparisons with variable-rate/fixed-power and variable-rate/variable-power
cases are given. Energy efficiency is further analyzed in the presence of
channel uncertainties. The optimal fraction of power allocated to training is
identified under QoS constraints. It is proven that the minimum bit energy in
the low-power regime is attained at a certain nonzero power level below which
bit energy increases without bound with vanishing power.
