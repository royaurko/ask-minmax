the organization. Thus, generation of high quality depends upon process, which
is in turn depends upon the people. Existing scenario in IT industries demands
a requirement for deploying the right personnel for achieving desirable quality
in the product through the existing process. The goal of this paper is to
identify the criteria which will be used in industrial practice to select
members of a software project team, and to look for relationships between these
criteria and project success. Using semi-structured interviews and qualitative
methods for data analysis and synthesis, a set of team building criteria was
identified from project managers in industry. The findings show that the
consistent use of the set of criteria correlated significantly with project
success, and the criteria related to human factors present strong correlations
with software quality and thereby project success. This knowledge enables
decision making for project managers in allocation of right personnel to
realize desired level.
