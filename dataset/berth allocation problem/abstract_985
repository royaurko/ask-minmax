This paper provides a review of recent advances in multi-user cooperative
data transmission. The focus is on the inherent trade-off between achievable
throughput and reliability of cooperative transmission. Research has shown that
under a fixed transmit energy budget, increased cooperation doesn't necessarily
lead to increased reliability. In fact, careful cooperation partner selection
and power allocation is needed in order to fully exploit the benefits of
cooperative transmission. Furthermore, depending on the multi-media content,
different cooperation strategies may need to be considered.
