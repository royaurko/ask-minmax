In this paper, new work is presented belonging to an ongoing study, which
evaluates civil communication standards as potential candidates for the future
military Wide Band Waveforms (WBWFs). After an evaluation process of possible
candidates presented in [2], the selection process in [1] showed that the IEEE
802.11n OFDM could be a possible military WBWF candidate, but it should be
further investigated first in order to enhance or even replace critical
modules. According to this, some critical modules of the physical layer has
been further analyzed in [3] regarding the susceptibility of the OFDM signal
under jammer influences. However, the critical modules of the MAC layer (e.g.,
probabilistic medium access CSMA/CA) have not been analysed. In fact, it was
only suggested in [2] to replace this medium access by the better suited
Unified Slot Allocation Protocol - Multiple Access (USAP-MA) [4]. In this
regard, the present contribution describes the design paradigms of the new MAC
layer and explains how the proposed WBWF candidate has been modelled within the
MiXiM Framework of the OMNeT++ simulator.
