Reliable empirical data and proper understanding of pedestrian dynamics are
necessary for fire safety design. However, specifications and data in different
handbooks as well as experimental studies differ considerably. In this study,
series of experiments under laboratory conditions were carried out to study the
characteristics of uni- and bidirectional pedestrian streams in straight
corridor. The Voronoi method is used to resolve the fine structure of the
resulting velocity-density relations and spatial dependence of the
measurements. The result shows differences in the shape of the relation for
\rho > 1.0 m-2. The maximal specific flow of unidirectional streams is
significantly larger than that of all bidirectional streams examined.
