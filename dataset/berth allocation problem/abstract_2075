A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows
what intelligence is. The problem is especially acute when we need to consider
artificial systems which are significantly different to humans. In this paper
we approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known
informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and
extract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to
produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. We believe
that this measure formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the
broadest reasonable sense.
