The online exchange of social recognition including, for instance, the
Facebook "like" appears to produce a scarce allocation without a clear utility
function defined for anyone involved. Given the importance attached to such
digital commodities by both users and advertisers, it is of interest to study
the forces governing their economics. Here we propose a centrality measure akin
to eigenvector centrality to describe an individual's perceived importance in
an online social network. It is shown in silico that strategically maximizing
this prestige metric results in finite nontrivial rates of "like" endowment.
Furthermore, it is found that systems of reputation-seeking agents are
supported most robustly by networks with the features of real human societies
including preferential attachment and the small-world property. We conclude
that the incentive system studied here can produce realistic behavior and may
therefore provide a framework for a more general model of decision-making in
online communities.
