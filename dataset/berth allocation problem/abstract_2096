In this paper we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of a
non-stationary problem that modelizes the behaviour of the concentrations and
the temperature of gases going through a cylindrical passage of an automotive
catalytic converter. This problem couples parabolic partial differential
equations in a domain with one parabolic partial differential equation and some
ordinary differential equations on a part of its boundary.
