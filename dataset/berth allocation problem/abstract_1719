We describe an approach to the question of finding real solutions to problems
of enumerative geometry, in particular the question of whether a problem of
enumerative geometry can have all of its solutions be real. We give some
methods to infer one problem can have all of its solutions be real, given that
a related problem does. These are used to show many Schubert-type enumerative
problems on some flag manifolds can have all of their solutions be real.
