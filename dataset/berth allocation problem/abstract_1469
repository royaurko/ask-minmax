ASTRO-F is the first Japanese satellite mission dedicated for large area
surveys in the infrared. The 69cm aperture telescope and scientific instruments
are cooled to 6K by liquid Helium and mechanical coolers. During the expected
mission life of more than 500 days, ASTRO-F will make the most advanced all-sky
survey in the mid- to far-infrared since the Infrared astronomical Satellite
(IRAS). The survey will be made in 6 wavebands and will include the first all
sky survey at >100-160(mu)m. Deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys with
pointed observations will also be carried out in 13 wavelength bands from
2-160(mu)m. ASTRO-F should detect more than a half million galaxies tracing the
large-scale structure of the Universe out to redshifts of unity, detecting
rare, exotic extraordinarily luminous objects at high redshift, numerous brown
dwarfs, Vega-like stars, protostars, and will reveal the large-scale structure
of nearby galactic star forming regions. ASTRO-F is a perfect complement to
Spitzer Space Telescope in respect of its wide sky and wavelength coverage.
Approximately 30 percent of pointed observations will be allocated to an
open-time opportunity. Updated pre-flight ensitivities as well as the
observation plan including the large-area surveys are described.
