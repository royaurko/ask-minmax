The Pulsar Virtual Observatory will provide a means for scientists in all
fields to access and analyze the large data sets stored in pulsar surveys
without specific knowledge about the data or the processing mechanisms. This is
achieved by moving the data and processing tools to a grid resource where the
details of the processing are seen by the users as abstract tasks. By
developing intelligent scheduling middle-ware the issues of interconnecting
tasks and allocating resources are removed from the user domain. This opens up
large sets of radio time-series data to a wider audience, enabling greater
cross field astronomy, in line with the virtual observatory concept.
Implementation of the Pulsar Virtual Observatory is underway, utilising the UK
National Grid Service as the principal grid resource.
