Allocation of molecules of para-dichlorbenzol in equimolar single crystals of
para-dichlorbenzol with p-dibromobenzene solid solutions grown by the
Bridgmen's method is studied. It is shown, that the mutual concentration of
builders longwise an exemplar depends on requirements of selection. Probably as
a uniform modification of concentration of builders along an exemplar, and a
wavy modification of concentration. Critical speed at a modification of
character of allocation made 15.0 $\cdot $10-6 cm/s at a lapse rate of
temperature dT/dl=7.7 grad/cm.
