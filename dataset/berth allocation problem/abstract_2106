A nonstationary spherically symmetric problem for conformal geometrodynamics
equations is considered and general exact solutions in quadratures are
obtained. Involvement of Weyl degrees of freedom allows us to consider the
problem with arbitrary initial data, as for the conformal geometrodynamics
equations the Cauchy problem is set up without connections to initial data. The
results of this paper are not confined with the framework of the perturbation
theory and open up new avenues for study of the process of space-time
singularity evolution in time.
