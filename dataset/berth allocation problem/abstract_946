Including Vaidya metric into the model of Expansive Nondecelerative Universe
allows to localize the energy of gravitational field. A term of effective
gravitational range is introduced and classic Newton potential is substituted
for Yukawa-type potential. It allows to allocate a typical frequency value to
each gravitational field. Derived theoretical conclusions led us to investigate
the effect of electromagnetic field with a precisely predetermined frequency
and intensity on iron. We believe that under certain circumstances a decrease
in iron gravitational mass should be observed. Two model experiments verifying
the theoretical conclusions are proposed.
