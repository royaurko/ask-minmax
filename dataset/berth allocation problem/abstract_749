We consider an application of multi-armed bandits to internet advertising
(specifically, to dynamic ad allocation in the pay-per-click model, with
uncertainty on the click probabilities). We focus on an important practical
issue that advertisers are constrained in how much money they can spend on
their ad campaigns. This issue has not been considered in the prior work on
bandit-based approaches for ad allocation, to the best of our knowledge.
  We define a simple, stylized model where an algorithm picks one ad to display
in each round, and each ad has a \emph{budget}: the maximal amount of money
that can be spent on this ad. This model admits a natural variant of UCB1, a
well-known algorithm for multi-armed bandits with stochastic rewards. We derive
strong provable guarantees for this algorithm.
