Equal allocation of bandwidth and/or power may not be efficient for wireless
multi-user networks with limited bandwidth and power resources. Joint bandwidth
and power allocation strategies for wireless multi-user networks with and
without relaying are proposed in this paper for (i) the maximization of the sum
capacity of all users; (ii) the maximization of the worst user capacity; and
(iii) the minimization of the total power consumption of all users. It is shown
that the proposed allocation problems are convex and, therefore, can be solved
efficiently. Moreover, the admission control based joint bandwidth and power
allocation is considered. A suboptimal greedy search algorithm is developed to
solve the admission control problem efficiently. The conditions under which the
greedy search is optimal are derived and shown to be mild. The performance
improvements offered by the proposed joint bandwidth and power allocation are
demonstrated by simulations. The advantages of the suboptimal greedy search
algorithm for admission control are also shown.
