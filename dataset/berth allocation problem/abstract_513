Response-adaptive randomization has recently attracted a lot of attention in
the literature. In this paper, we propose a new and simple family of
response-adaptive randomization procedures that attain the Cramer--Rao lower
bounds on the allocation variances for any allocation proportions, including
optimal allocation proportions. The allocation probability functions of
proposed procedures are discontinuous. The existing large sample theory for
adaptive designs relies on Taylor expansions of the allocation probability
functions, which do not apply to nondifferentiable cases. In the present paper,
we study stopping times of stochastic processes to establish the asymptotic
efficiency results. Furthermore, we demonstrate our proposal through examples,
simulations and a discussion on the relationship with earlier works, including
Efron's biased coin design.
