We study the problem of allocating items to two agents with arbitrary
valuation functions. Instead of actual money, we use sequential auctions with
"scrip money", i.e. money that has no value outside the auction.
  By considering such scrip auctions as a special case of more general
\emph{bidding games}, we show that there exists a natural pure subgame perfect
Nash equilibrium (PSPE) with the following desirable properties: (a) agents'
utility is weakly monotone in their budget; (b) a Pareto-efficient outcome is
reached for any initial budget; and (c) for any Pareto-efficient outcome there
is an initial budget s.t. this outcome is attained. In particular, we can
assign the budget so as to implement the outcome with maximum social welfare,
maximum Egalitarian welfare, etc.
  We provide an efficient algorithm to compute a PSPE in bidding games, and
draw implications of the above result for various games and mechanism design
problems.
