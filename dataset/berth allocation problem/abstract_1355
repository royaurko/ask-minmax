Many opportunistic scheduling techniques are impractical because they require
accurate channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. In this paper, we
investigate the scheduling of unicast and multicast services in a downlink
network with a very limited amount of feedback information. Specifically,
unicast users send imperfect (or no) CSI and infrequent acknowledgements (ACKs)
to a base station, and multicast users only report infrequent ACKs to avoid
feedback implosion. We consider the use of physical-layer rateless codes, which
not only combats channel uncertainty, but also reduces the overhead of ACK
feedback. A joint scheduling and power allocation scheme is developed to
realize multiuser diversity gain for unicast service and multicast gain for
multicast service. We prove that our scheme achieves a near-optimal throughput
region. Our simulation results show that our scheme significantly improves the
network throughput over schemes employing fixed-rate codes or using only
unicast communications.
