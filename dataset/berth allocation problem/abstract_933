The Available Bit Rate (ABR) service has been developed to support data
applications over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. The network
continuously monitors its traffic and provides feedback to the source end
systems. This paper explains the rules that the sources have to follow to
achieve a fair and efficient allocation of network resources.
