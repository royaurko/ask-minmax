We propose a new radio resource management algorithm which aims at minimizing
the base station supply power consumption for multi-user MIMO-OFDM. Given a
base station power model that establishes a relation between the RF transmit
power and the supply power consumption, the algorithm optimizes the trade-off
between three basic power-saving mechanisms: antenna adaptation, power control
and discontinuous transmission. The algorithm comprises two steps: a) the first
step estimates sleep mode duration, resource shares and antenna configuration
based on average channel conditions and b) the second step exploits
instantaneous channel knowledge at the transmitter for frequency selective
time-variant channels. The proposed algorithm finds the number of transmit
antennas, the RF transmission power per resource unit and spatial channel, the
number of discontinuous transmission time slots, and the multi-user resource
allocation, such that supply power consumption is minimized. Simulation results
indicate that the proposed algorithm is capable of reducing the supply power
consumption by between 25% and 40%, dependend on the system load.
