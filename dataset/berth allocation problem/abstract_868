One of the major challenges of cloud computing is the management of
request-response coupling and optimal allocation strategies of computational
resources for the various types of service requests. In the normal situations
the intelligence required to classify the nature and order of the request using
standard methods is insufficient because the arrival of request is at a random
fashion and it is meant for multiple resources with different priority order
and variety. Hence, it becomes absolutely essential that we identify the trends
of different request streams in every category by auto classifications and
organize preallocation strategies in a predictive way. It calls for designs of
intelligent modes of interaction between the client request and cloud computing
resource manager. This paper discusses about the corresponding scheme using
Adaptive Resonance Theory-2.
