To address network congestion stemmed from traffic generated by advanced user
equipments, in [1] we propose a novel network resource allocation strategy,
time-frequency resource conversion (TFRC), via exploiting user behavior, a
specific kind of context information. Considering an LTE-type cellular network,
a call admission control policy called double-threshold guard channel policy is
proposed there to facilitate the implementation of TFRC. In this report, we
present state transition analysis of this TFRC-based call admission control
policy for an LTE-type cellular network. Overall, there are five categories of
events that can trigger a transition of the system state: 1) a new call
arrival; 2) a handoff user arrival; 3) a handoff user departure; 4) a call
termination; and 5) a periodic time-frequency resource conversion. We analyze
them case by case in this report and the validation of the analysis has been
provided in [1].
