Provisioning of quality of service (QoS) is a key issue in visible light
communication (VLC) system as well as in other wireless communication systems.
Due to the fact that QoS requirements are not as strict for all traffic types,
more calls of higher priority traffic classes can be accommodated by blocking
some more calls of lower priority traffic classes. Diverse types of high data
rate traffic are supported by existing wireless communication systems while the
resource is limited. Hence, priority based resource allocation can ensure the
service quality for the calls of important traffic class. The fixed guard
channels to prioritize any class of calls always reduce the channel
utilization. In this paper we propose a priority based dynamic channel
reservation scheme for higher priority calls that does not reduce the channel
utilization significantly. The number of reserved channels for each of the
individual traffic classes is calculated using real-time observation of the
call arrival rates of all the traffic classes. The features of the scheme allow
reduction of the call blocking probability of higher priority calls along with
the increase of the channel utilization. The proposed Markov Chain model is
expected to be very much effective for the queuing analysis especially for the
priority scheme of any number of traffic classes. The numerical results show
that the proposed scheme is able to attain reasonable call blocking probability
of higher priority calls without sacrificing channel utilization.
