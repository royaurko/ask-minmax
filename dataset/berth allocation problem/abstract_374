Research is described on a system for web-assisted education and how it is
used to deliver on-line drill questions, automatically suited to individual
students. The system can store and display all of the various pieces of
information used in a class-room (slides, examples, handouts, drill items) and
give individualized drills to participating students. The system is built on
the basic theme that it is for learning rather than evaluation.
  Experimental results shown here imply that both the item database and the
item allocation methods are important and examples are given on how these need
to be tuned for each course. Different item allocation methods are discussed
and a method is proposed for comparing several such schemes. It is shown that
students improve their knowledge while using the system. Classical statistical
models which do not include learning, but are designed for mere evaluation, are
therefore not applicable.
  A corollary of the openness and emphasis on learning is that the student is
permitted to continue requesting drill items until the system reports a grade
which is satisfactory to the student. An obvious resulting challenge is how
such a grade should be computed so as to reflect actual knowledge at the time
of computation, entice the student to continue and simultaneously be a clear
indication for the student. To name a few methods, a grade can in principle be
computed based on all available answers on a topic, on the last few answers or
on answers up to a given number of attempts, but all of these have obvious
problems.
