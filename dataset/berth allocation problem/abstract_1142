We consider a wireless node that randomly receives data from different sensor
units. The arriving data must be compressed, stored, and transmitted over a
wireless link, where both the compression and transmission operations consume
power. Specifically, the controller must choose from one of multiple
compression options every timeslot. Each option requires a different amount of
power and has different compression ratio properties. Further, the wireless
link has potentially time-varying channels, and transmission rates depend on
current channel states and transmission power allocations. We design a dynamic
algorithm for joint compression and transmission, and prove that it comes
arbitrarily close to minimizing average power expenditure, with an explicit
tradeoff in average delay. Our approach uses stochastic network optimization
together with a concept of place holder bits to provide efficient energy-delay
performance. The algorithm is simple to implement and does not require
knowledge of probability distributions for packet arrivals or channel states.
Extensions that treat distortion constraints are also considered.
