Preventive care service delivery faces immense challenges when it comes to
the level of coverage. Within this context, the case of child immunization is
presented by applying operations management tools. This paper explores the
application of integer programming techniques to support the Expanded Programme
of Immunization (EPI) service in the Dera Ismail Khan District of Pakistan. The
main concern here is equitable service delivery to decentralized localities
based on two criteria: (1) achieving the highest possible level of vaccination
among the target population; and 2) ensuring equality among geographically
scattered populations, especially in rural dwellings. For this purpose two
integer programming models have been applied on the basis of (1) sub-dividing
health district into localities and allocating vaccinators to visit and
vaccinate children within their administrative boundaries, and (2) within the
localized planning system allowing vaccinators to visit and vaccinate children
across the administrative boundaries subject to savings in travel time. Both
models show interesting results in terms of need satisfaction and travel-time
savings with a minimum level of deviation from equity. The solutions provide a
trade-off between alternative organizational tactics, and the argument is made
that rational planning methods applied interactively can contribute to the
delivery of an immunization service that is equitable and cost effective.
