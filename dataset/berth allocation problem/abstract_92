In this paper we address the problem of transmission of correlated sources
over a fast fading multiple access channel (MAC) with partial channel state
information available at both the encoders and the decoder. We provide
sufficient conditions for transmission with given distortions. Next these
conditions are specialized to a Gaussian MAC (GMAC). We provide the optimal
power allocation strategy and compare the strategy with various levels of
channel state information.
