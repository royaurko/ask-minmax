  The seaport of Gioia Tauro is the largest transshipment terminal of the
Mediterranean coast. A crucial management task for the companies operating in
the seaport is team building: the problem of properly allocating the available
personnel for serving the incoming ships. Teams have to be carefully arranged
in order to meet several constraints, such as allocation of the employees with
the appropriate skills, fair distribution of the working load, and turnover of
the heavy/dangerous roles. This makes team building a hard and expensive task
requiring several hours per day of manual preparation.
  In this paper we present a system based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) for
the automatic generation of the teams of employees in the seaport of Gioia
Tauro. The system is currently exploited in the Gioia Tauro seaport by ICO BLG,
a company specialized in automobile logistics.
