Spectrum scarceness is one of the major challenges that the present world is
facing. The efficient use of existing licensed spectrum is becoming most
critical as growing demand of the radio spectrum. Different researches show
that the use of licensed are not utilized inefficiently. It has been also shown
that primary user does not use more than 70% of the licensed frequency band
most of the time. Many researchers are trying to found the techniques that
efficiently utilize the under-utilized licensed spectrum. One of the approaches
is the use of "Cognitive Radio". This allows the radio to learn from its
environment, changing certain parameters. Based on this knowledge the radio can
dynamically exploit the spectrum holes in the licensed band of the spectrum.
This paper w i l l focus on the performance of spectrum allocation technique,
based on popular meta-heuristics Genetics Algorithm and analyzing the
performance of this technique using Mat Lab.
