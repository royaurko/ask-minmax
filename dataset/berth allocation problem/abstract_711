Voice services over Adaptive Multi-user channels on One Slot (VAMOS) has been
standardized as an extension to the Global System for Mobile Communications
(GSM). The aim of VAMOS is to increase the capacity of GSM, while maintaining
backward compatibility with the legacy system. To this end, the Orthogonal
Sub-channels (OSC) concept is employed, where two Gaussian minimum-shift keying
(GMSK) signals are transmitted in the same time slot and with the same carrier
frequency. To fully exploit the possible capacity gain of OSC, new receiver
concepts are necessary. In contrast to the base station, where multiple
antennas can be employed, the mobile station is typically equipped with only
one receive antenna. Therefore, the downlink receiver design is a very
challenging task. Different concepts for channel estimation, user separation,
and equalization at the receiver of an OSC downlink transmission are introduced
in this paper. Furthermore, the system capacity must be improved by suitable
downlink power and resource allocation algorithms. Making realistic assumptions
on the information available at the base station, an algorithm for joint power
and radio resource allocation is proposed. Simulation results show the
excellent performance of the proposed channel estimation algorithms,
equalization schemes, and joint radio resource and power allocation algorithms
in realistic VAMOS environments.
