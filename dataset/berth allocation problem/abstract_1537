High-throughput biological assays such as microarrays let us ask very
detailed questions about how diseases operate, and promise to let us
personalize therapy. Data processing, however, is often not described well
enough to allow for exact reproduction of the results, leading to exercises in
"forensic bioinformatics" where aspects of raw data and reported results are
used to infer what methods must have been employed. Unfortunately, poor
documentation can shift from an inconvenience to an active danger when it
obscures not just methods but errors. In this report we examine several related
papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity
derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical
trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis of these
results. However, we show in five case studies that the results incorporate
several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that
emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column
offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are
common. We then discuss steps we are taking to avoid such errors in our own
investigations.
