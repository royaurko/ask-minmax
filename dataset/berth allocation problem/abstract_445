A system-of-systems (SoS) is a large information processing system formed by
the integration of autonomous computer systems (called constituent systems,
CS), physical machines and humans for the purpose of providing new synergistic
services and/or more efficient economic processes. In a number of applications,
e.g robotics, the autonomous CSs must coordinate their actions in the temporal
domain to realize the desired objectives. In this paper we argue that the
introduction of a proper global physical time establishes a shared view about
the progress of physical time and helps to realize the temporal coordination of
the autonomous CSs. The available global time can also be used to simplify the
solution of many challenging problems within the SoS, such as distributed
resource allocation, and helps to improve the dependability and fault-tolerance
of the SoS.
