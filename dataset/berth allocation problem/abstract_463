For assignment problems where agents, specifying ordinal preferences, are
allocated indivisible objects, two widely studied randomized mechanisms are the
Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) and Probabilistic Serial Rule (PS). These two
mechanisms both have desirable economic and computational properties, but the
outcomes they induce can be incomparable in many instances, thus creating
challenges in deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice. In this paper we
first look at the space of lexicographic preferences and show that, as opposed
to the general preference domain, RSD satisfies envyfreeness. Moreover, we show
that although under lexicographic preferences PS is strategyproof when the
number of objects is less than or equal agents, it is strictly manipulable when
there are more objects than agents. In the space of general preferences, we
provide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS, analyze
economic properties, and provide further insights on the applicability of each
mechanism in different application domains.
