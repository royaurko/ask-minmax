Engineers in the manufacturing industries have used accelerated test (AT)
experiments for many decades. The purpose of AT experiments is to acquire
reliability information quickly. Test units of a material, component, subsystem
or entire systems are subjected to higher-than-usual levels of one or more
accelerating variables such as temperature or stress. Then the AT results are
used to predict life of the units at use conditions. The extrapolation is
typically justified (correctly or incorrectly) on the basis of physically
motivated models or a combination of empirical model fitting with a sufficient
amount of previous experience in testing similar units. The need to extrapolate
in both time and the accelerating variables generally necessitates the use of
fully parametric models. Statisticians have made important contributions in the
development of appropriate stochastic models for AT data [typically a
distribution for the response and regression relationships between the
parameters of this distribution and the accelerating variable(s)], statistical
methods for AT planning (choice of accelerating variable levels and allocation
of available test units to those levels) and methods of estimation of suitable
reliability metrics. This paper provides a review of many of the AT models that
have been used successfully in this area.
