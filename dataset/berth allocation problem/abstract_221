In this paper, we study band allocation of $\mathcal{M}_s$ buffered secondary
users (SUs) to $\mathcal{M}_p$ orthogonal primary licensed bands, where each
primary band is assigned to one primary user (PU). Each SU is assigned to one
of the available primary bands with a certain probability designed to satisfy
some specified quality of service (QoS) requirements for the SUs. In the
proposed system, only one SU is assigned to a particular band. The optimization
problem used to obtain the stability region's envelope (closure) is shown to be
a linear program. We compare the stability region of the proposed system with
that of a system where each SU chooses a band randomly with some assignment
probability. We also compare with a fixed (deterministic) assignment system,
where only one SU is assigned to one of the primary bands all the time. We
prove the advantage of the proposed system over the other systems.
