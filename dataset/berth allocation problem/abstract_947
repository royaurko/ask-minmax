We develop and analyze new cooperative strategies for ad hoc networks that
are more spectrally efficient than classical DF cooperative protocols. Using
analog network coding, our strategies preserve the practical half-duplex
assumption but relax the orthogonality constraint. The introduction of
interference due to non-orthogonality is mitigated thanks to precoding, in
particular Dirty Paper coding. Combined with smart power allocation, our
cooperation strategies allow to save time and lead to more efficient use of
bandwidth and to improved network throughput with respect to classical RDF/PDF.
