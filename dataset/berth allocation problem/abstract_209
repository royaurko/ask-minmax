Opportunistically sharing the white spaces, or the temporarily unoccupied
spectrum licensed to the primary user (PU), is a practical way to improve the
spectrum utilization. In this paper, we consider the fundamental problem of
rate regions achievable for multiple secondary users (SUs) which send their
information to a common receiver over such a white space channel. In
particular, the PU activities are treated as on/off side information, which can
be obtained causally or non-causally by the SUs. The system is then modeled as
a multi-switch channel and its achievable rate regions are characterized in
some scenarios. Explicit forms of outer and inner bounds of the rate regions
are derived by assuming additional side information, and they are shown to be
tight in some special cases. An optimal rate and power allocation scheme that
maximizes the sum rate is also proposed. The numerical results reveal the
impacts of side information, channel correlation and PU activity on the
achievable rates, and also verify the effectiveness of our rate and power
allocation scheme. Our work may shed some light on the fundamental limit and
design tradeoffs in practical cognitive radio systems.
