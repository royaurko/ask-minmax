The robust application of wireless sensor networks has increased during the
past decade due to the potential use of wireless nodes in transmission of
information by decreasing latency for surveillance and monitoring. The study
proposes an Energy Efficient Dynamic Scenario (EEDS) for cluster head
allocation for optimum balance in the energy consumption of the whole network
that will prolong the lifetime of the network in an efficient manner. In this
paper, a two-level fuzzy logic is proposed in choosing cluster head based on
node localization and network traffic. In the upper decision making level
called global level of qualification leads to better performance of the
inference system based on all the above six fuzzy parameters for establishing
an energy efficient network model. We develop an algorithm to calculate energy
across the network if the source and destination is known. We evaluate the cost
and benefit of the data fusion, in order to adaptively adjust whether fusion
shall be performed for minimizing the total energy consumption when energy
efficient node scheduling migrates from a particular node to another node.
Simulation results show that EEDS gives the best performance with respect to
network life time density and residual energy of the node.
