Resource allocation problems are usually solved with specialized methods
exploiting their general sparsity and problem-specific algebraic structure. We
show that the sparsity structure alone yields a closed-form Newton search
direction for the generic primal-dual interior point method. Computational
tests show that the interior point method consistently outperforms the best
specialized methods when no additional algebraic structure is available.
