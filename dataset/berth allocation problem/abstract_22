In this paper, we consider resource allocation optimization problem in
cellular networks for different types of users running multiple applications
simultaneously. In our proposed model, each user application is assigned a
utility function that represents the application type running on the user
equipment (UE). The network operators assign a subscription weight to each UE
based on its subscription. Each UE assigns an application weight to each of its
applications based on the instantaneous usage percentage of the application.
Additionally, UEs with higher priority assign applications target rates to
their applications. Our objective is to allocate the resources optimally among
the UEs and their applications from a single evolved node B (eNodeB) based on a
utility proportional fairness policy with priority to real-time application
users. A minimum quality of service (QoS) is guaranteed to each UE application
based on the UE subscription weight, the UE application weight and the UE
application target rate. We propose a two-stage rate allocation algorithm to
allocate the eNodeB resources among users and their applications. Finally, we
present simulation results for the performance of our rate allocation
algorithm.
