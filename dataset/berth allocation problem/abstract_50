The problem of power allocation is studied for a multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) decode-and-forward (DF) two-way relaying system
consisting of two source nodes and one relay. It is shown that achieving
maximum sum-rate in such a system does not necessarily demand the consumption
of all available power at the relay. Instead, the maximum sum-rate can be
achieved through efficient power allocation with minimum power consumption.
Deriving such power allocation, however, is nontrivial due to the fact that it
generally leads to a nonconvex problem. In Part I of this two-part paper, a
sum-rate maximizing power allocation with minimum power consumption is found
for MIMO DF two-way relaying, in which the relay optimizes its own power
allocation strategy given the power allocation strategies of the source nodes.
An algorithm is proposed for efficiently finding the optimal power allocation
of the relay based on the proposed idea of relative water-levels. The
considered scenario features low complexity due to the fact that the relay
optimizes its power allocation without coordinating the source nodes. As a
trade-off for the low complexity, it is shown that there can be waste of power
at the source nodes because of no coordination between the relay and the source
nodes. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm
and the effect of asymmetry on the considered system.
