In this paper, we discuss a new contact way for exchanging personal
information using mobile phones. The idea of this invention depends on
allocating a special code called Gharibi Code (GC) for each personal mobile and
creating a personal information file called Gharibi Face Card (GFC), which has
all specified personal data of the mobile phone user. When you request
someone's GC code, the other party's phone will send you the GFC of that
person. We think that this approach will facilitate the process of
communication and exchanging the specified personal data easily, especially
when acquaintance. Mobile number, phone and e-mail address, for example, will
be sent in a few seconds using a simple code that does not exceed six
characters long to transfer a huge amount of personal data through mobile
devices rather than using traditional business or visiting cards.
