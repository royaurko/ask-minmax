In this paper, we consider a single-cell IEEE 802.16 environment in which the
base station allocates subchannels to the subscriber stations in its coverage
area. The subchannels allocated to a subscriber station are shared by multiple
connections at that subscriber station. To ensure the Quality of Service (QoS)
performances, two Connection Admission Control (CAC) mechanisms, namely,
threshold-based and queue-aware CAC mechanisms are considered at a subscriber
station. A queuing analytical framework for these admission control mechanisms
is presented considering Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)
based transmission at the physical layer. Then, based on the queuing model,
both the connection-level and the packet-level performances are studied and
compared with their analogues in the case without CAC. The connection arrival
is modeled by a Poisson process and the packet arrival for a connection by
Batch Markov Arrival Process (BMAP). We determine analytically and numerically
different QoS performance measures (connection blocking probability, average
number of ongoing connections, average queue length, packet dropping
probability, queue throughput and average packet delay).
