Data grid is a distributed computing architecture that integrates a large
number of data and computing resources into a single virtual data management
system. It enables the sharing and coordinated use of data from various
resources and provides various services to fit the needs of high performance
distributed and data-intensive computing. Here data partitioning and dynamic
replication in data grid are considered. In which security and access
performance of a system are efficient. There are several important requirements
for data grids, including information survivability, security, and access
performance. More specifically, the investigation is the problem of optimal
allocation of sensitive data objects that are partitioned by using secret
sharing scheme or erasure coding scheme and replicated. DATA PARTITIONING is
known as the single data can be divided into multiple objects. REPLICATION is
known as process of sharing information. storing same data in multiple systems.
Replication techniques are frequently used to improve data availability. Single
point failure does not affect this system. Where the data will be secured.
