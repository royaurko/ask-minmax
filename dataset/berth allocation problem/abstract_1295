We introduce the contributor-topic model, a generative model for documents that
extends Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Blei, Ng, & Jordan, 2003) to include
contributorship information. Each contributor is associated with a multinomial
distribution over topics and each topic is associated with a multinomial
distribution over words. A document with multiple contributors is modeled as a
distribution over topics that is a mixture of the distributions associated with
the contributors. We apply the model to a collection of 1,700 NIPS conference papers
and 160,000 CiteSeer abstracts. Exact inference is intractable for these
datasets and we use Gibbs sampling to estimate the topic and contributor
distributions. We compare the performance with two other generative models for
documents, which are special cases of the contributor-topic model: LDA (a topic
model) and a simple contributor model in which each contributor is associated with a
distribution over words rather than a distribution over topics. We show topics
recovered by the contributor-topic model, and demonstrate applications to computing
similarity between contributors and entropy of contributor output.
