The point-to-point multiple-antenna channel is investigated in uncorrelated
block fading environment with Rayleigh distribution. The maximum throughput and
maximum expected-rate of this channel are derived under the assumption that the
transmitter is oblivious to the channel state information (CSI), however, the
receiver has perfect CSI. First, we prove that in multiple-input single-output
(MISO) channels, the optimum transmission strategy maximizing the throughput is
to use all available antennas and perform equal power allocation with
uncorrelated signals. Furthermore, to increase the expected-rate, multi-layer
coding is applied. Analogously, we establish that sending uncorrelated signals
and performing equal power allocation across all available antennas at each
layer is optimum. A closed form expression for the maximum continuous-layer
expected-rate of MISO channels is also obtained. Moreover, we investigate
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, and formulate the maximum
throughput in the asymptotically low and high SNR regimes and also
asymptotically large number of transmit or receive antennas by obtaining the
optimum transmit covariance matrix. Finally, a distributed antenna system,
wherein two single-antenna transmitters want to transmit a common message to a
single-antenna receiver, is considered. It is shown that this system has the
same outage probability and hence, throughput and expected-rate, as a
point-to-point $2\times 1$ MISO channel.
