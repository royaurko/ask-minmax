The paper discusses Problems 8 and 88 posed by Stanislaw Mazur in the
Scottish Book. It turns out that negative solutions to both problems are
immediate consequences of the results of Section 5 of my paper "Estimates of
functions of power bounded operators on Hilbert spaces", J. Operator Theory 7
(1982), 341-372. We discuss here some quantitative aspects of Problems 8 and 88
and give answers to open problems discussed in a recent paper by Pelczynski and
Sukochev.
