We explore the use of exact diagonalization methods for solving the self
consistent equations of the cellular dynamical mean field theory (CDMFT) for
the one dimensional regular and extended Hubbard models. We investigate the
nature of the Mott transition and convergence of the method as a function of
cluster size as well as the optimal allocation of computational resources
between bath and `cluster-impurity' sites, with a view to develop a
renormalization group method in higher dimensions. We assess the performance of
the method by comparing results for the Green's functions in both the spin
density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW) phases with accurate density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations.
