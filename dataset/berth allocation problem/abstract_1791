We consider a non-polynomial cubic spline to develop the classes of methods
for the numerical solution of singularly perturbed two-point boundary value
problems. The proposed methods are second and fourth order accurate and
applicable to problems both in singular and non-singular cases. Numerical
results are given to illustrate the efficiency of our methods and compared with
the methods given by different contributors.
