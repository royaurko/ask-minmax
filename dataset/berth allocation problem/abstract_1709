In this paper, we investigate the sampling analysis associated with
discontinuous Sturm-Liouville problem which has transmission conditions at two
points of discontinuity also contains an eigenparameter in a boundary condition
and two transmission conditions. We establish briefly spectral properties of
the problem and then we prove the sampling theorem associated with the problem.
