Multiple-antenna "based" transmitter (TX) cooperation has been established as
a promising tool towards avoiding, aligning, or shaping the interference
resulting from aggressive spectral reuse. The price paid in the form of
feedback and exchanging channel state information (CSI) between cooperating
devices in most existing methods is often underestimated however. In reality,
feedback and information overhead threatens the practicality and scalability of
TX cooperation approaches in dense networks. Hereby we addresses a "Who needs
to know what?" problem, when it comes to CSI at cooperating transmitters. A
comprehensive answer to this question remains beyond our reach and the scope of
this paper. Nevertheless, recent results in this area suggest that CSI overhead
can be contained for even large networks provided the allocation of feedback to
TXs is made non-uniform and to properly depend on the network's topology. This
paper provides a few hints toward solving the problem.
