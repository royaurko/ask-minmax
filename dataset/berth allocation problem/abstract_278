Energy efficiency has become an important measurement of scheduling algorithm
for private cloud. The challenge is trade-off between minimizing of energy
consumption and satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) (e.g. performance or
resource availability on time for reservation request). We consider resource
needs in context of a private cloud system to provide resources for
applications in teaching and researching. In which users request computing
resources for laboratory classes at start times and non-interrupted duration in
some hours in prior. Many previous works are based on migrating techniques to
move online virtual machines (VMs) from low utilization hosts and turn these
hosts off to reduce energy consumption. However, the techniques for migration
of VMs could not use in our case. In this paper, a genetic algorithm for
power-aware in scheduling of resource allocation (GAPA) has been proposed to
solve the static virtual machine allocation problem (SVMAP). Due to limited
resources (i.e. memory) for executing simulation, we created a workload that
contains a sample of one-day timetable of lab hours in our university. We
evaluate the GAPA and a baseline scheduling algorithm (BFD), which sorts list
of virtual machines in start time (i.e. earliest start time first) and using
best-fit decreasing (i.e. least increased power consumption) algorithm, for
solving the same SVMAP. As a result, the GAPA algorithm obtains total energy
consumption is lower than the baseline algorithm on simulated experimentation.
