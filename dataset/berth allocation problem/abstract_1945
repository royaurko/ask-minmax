A new presentation of the $n$-string braid group $B_n$ is studied. Using it,
a new solution to the word problem in $B_n$ is obtained which retains most of
the desirable features of the Garside-Thurston solution, and at the same time
makes possible certain computational improvements. We also give a related
solution to the conjugacy problem, but the improvements in its complexity are
not clear at this writing.
