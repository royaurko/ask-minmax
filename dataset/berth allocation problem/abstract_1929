We study the computational complexity of the graph modification problems
Threshold Editing and Chain Editing, adding and deleting as few edges as
possible to transform the input into a threshold (or chain) graph. In this
article, we show that both problems are NP-complete, resolving a conjecture by
Natanzon, Shamir, and Sharan (Discrete Applied Mathematics, 113(1):109--128,
2001). On the positive side, we show the problem admits a quadratic vertex
kernel. Furthermore, we give a subexponential time parameterized algorithm
solving Threshold Editing in $2^{O(\surd k \log k)} + \text{poly}(n)$ time,
making it one of relatively few natural problems in this complexity class on
general graphs. These results are of broader interest to the field of social
network analysis, where recent work of Brandes (ISAAC, 2014) posits that the
minimum edit distance to a threshold graph gives a good measure of consistency
for node centralities. Finally, we show that all our positive results extend to
the related problem of Chain Editing, as well as the completion and deletion
variants of both problems.
