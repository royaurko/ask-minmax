A service provisioning system is examined, where a number of servers are used
to offer different types of services to paying customers. A customer is charged
for the execution of a stream of jobs; the number of jobs in the stream and the
rate of their submission is specified. On the other hand, the provider promises
a certain quality of service (QoS), measured by the average waiting time of the
jobs in the stream. A penalty is paid if the agreed QoS requirement is not met.
The objective is to maximize the total average revenue per unit time. Dynamic
policies for making server allocation and stream admission decisions are
introduced and evaluated. The results of several simulations are described.
