Expanding a lower-dimensional problem to a higher-dimensional space and then
projecting back is often beneficial. This article rigorously investigates this
perspective in the context of finite mixture models, namely how to improve
inference for mixture models by using auxiliary variables. Despite the large
literature in mixture models and several empirical examples, there is no
previous work that gives general theoretical justification for including
auxiliary variables in mixture models, even for special cases. We provide a
theoretical basis for comparing inference for mixture multivariate models with
the corresponding inference for marginal univariate mixture models. Analytical
results for several special cases are established. We show that the probability
of correctly allocating mixture memberships and the information number for the
means of the primary outcome in a bivariate model with two Gaussian mixtures
are generally larger than those in each univariate model. Simulations under a
range of scenarios, including misspecified models, are conducted to examine the
improvement. The method is illustrated by two real applications in ecology and
causal inference.
