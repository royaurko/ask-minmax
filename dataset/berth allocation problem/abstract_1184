This paper proposes a nonparametric Bayesian method for exploratory data
analysis and feature construction in continuous time series. Our method focuses
on understanding shared features in a set of time series that exhibit
significant individual variability. Our method builds on the framework of
latent Diricihlet allocation (LDA) and its extension to hierarchical Dirichlet
processes, which allows us to characterize each series as switching between
latent ``topics'', where each topic is characterized as a distribution over
``words'' that specify the series dynamics. However, unlike standard
applications of LDA, we discover the words as we learn the model. We apply this
model to the task of tracking the physiological signals of premature infants;
our model obtains clinically significant insights as well as useful features
for supervised learning tasks.
