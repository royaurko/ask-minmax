To maximize efficiency in time and space, allocations and deallocations, in
the exact linear algebra library \linbox, must always occur in the founding
scope. This provides a simple lightweight allocation model. We present this
model and its usage for the rebinding of matrices between different coefficient
domains. We also present automatic tools to speed-up the compilation of
template libraries and a software abstraction layer for the introduction of
transparent parallelism at the algorithmic level.
