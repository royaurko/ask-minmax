An algebraic multigrid method is proposed to solve eigenvalue problems based
on the combination of the multilevel correction scheme and the algebraic
multigrid method for linear equations. The algebraic multigrid method setup
procedure is applied to construct the hierarchy and the intergrid transfer
operators. In the algebraic multigrid scheme, a large scale eigenvalue problem
can be solved by some algebraic multigrid smoothing steps in the hierarchy and
some eigenvalue problems solving in a very small dimension. Some numerical
experiments are presented to validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
