We propose a survey of Michel H\'enon works devoted to studying periodic
solutions of the well-known celestial mechanics problem -- restricted
three-body problem. The description of the main results obtained by H\'enon is
given in comparison with results of russian mathematician Alexander Bruno.
Finaly, a survey of H\'enon's works on Hill problem is given as well, and, more
over, the contributors propose some generalization of Hill problem that makes
possible to provide the description of its families of periodic orbits in the
form of common network.
