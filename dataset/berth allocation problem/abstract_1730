In the paper is considered two problems on extension of operators whose range
space for the first problem (or domain space for the second one) belongs to the
fixed class of finite equivalence, which is generated by a given Banach space
$X$. Both problems are considered in two variants: isometric and isomorphic
ones. Received a full solution of the first problem and the solution, close to
final one for the second problem.
