In this paper, a joint power allocation algorithm with minimum mean-squared
error (MMSE) receiver for a cooperative Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output
(MIMO) network which employs multiple relays and a Decode-and-Forward (DF)
strategy is proposed. A Distributed Space-Time Coding (DSTC) scheme is applied
in each relay node. We present a joint constrained optimization algorithm to
determine the power allocation parameters and the MMSE receive filter parameter
vectors for each transmitted symbol in each link, as well as the channel
coefficients matrix. A Stochastic Gradient (SG) algorithm is derived for the
calculation of the joint optimization in order to release the receiver from the
massive calculation complexity for the MMSE receive filter and power allocation
parameters. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm obtains
gains compared to the equal power allocation system.
