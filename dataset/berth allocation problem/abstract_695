The paper proposes a two player game based strategy for resource allocation
in service computing domain such as cloud, grid etc. The players are modeled as
demand/workflows for the resource and represent multiple types of qualitative
and quantitative factors. The proposed strategy will classify them in two
classes. The proposed system would forecast outcome using a priori information
available and measure/estimate existing parameters such as utilization and
delay in an optimal load-balanced paradigm.
