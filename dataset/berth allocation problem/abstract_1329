We derive the joint probability distribution of zero-forcing (ZF) V-BLAST
gains under a greedy selection of decoding order and no error propagation.
Unlike the previous approximated analyses, a mathematical framework is built by
applying order statistics rules and an exact closed-form joint probability
density function expression for squared layer gains is obtained. Our analysis
relies on the fact that all orderings are equiprobable under independent and
identical Rayleigh fading. Based on this idea, we determine the joint
distribution of the ordered gains from the joint distribution of the unordered
gains. Our results are applicable for any number of transmit and receive
antennas. Although we present our analysis in a ZF V-BLAST setting, our
analytical results can be directly applied for the dual cases of ZF V-BLAST.
Under the assumption of a low rate feedback of decoding order to the
transmitter, a benefit of having exact expressions is illustrated by the
calculation of the cutoff value under optimal power allocation that maximizes
the sum of the substream outage capacities under a given sum power constraint.
We provide numerical results and verify our analysis by means of simulations.
