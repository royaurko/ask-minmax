Tumor samples are heterogeneous. They consist of different subclones that are
characterized by differences in DNA nucleotide sequences and copy numbers on
multiple loci. Heterogeneity can be measured through the identification of the
subclonal copy number and sequence at a selected set of loci. Understanding
that the accurate identification of variant allele fractions greatly depends on
a precise determination of copy numbers, we develop a Bayesian feature
allocation model for jointly calling subclonal copy numbers and the
corresponding allele sequences for the same loci. The proposed method utilizes
three random matrices, L, Z and w to represent subclonal copy numbers (L),
numbers of subclonal variant alleles (Z) and cellular fractions of subclones in
samples (w), respectively. The unknown number of subclones implies a random
number of columns for these matrices. We use next-generation sequencing data to
estimate the subclonal structures through inference on these three matrices.
Using simulation studies and a real data analysis, we demonstrate how posterior
inference on the subclonal structure is enhanced with the joint modeling of
both structure and sequencing variants on subclonal genomes. Software is
