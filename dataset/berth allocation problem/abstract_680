Sourcing processes are discussed at a high abstraction level. A dedicated
terminology is developed concerning general aspects of sourcing. The term
sourcement is coined to denote a building block for sourcing. No- tions of
allocation, functional architecture and allocational architecture, equilibrium,
and configuration are discussed. Limitations of the concept of outsourcing are
outlined. This theoretical work is meant to serve as a point of departure for
the subsequent development of a detailed theory of sourcing and sourcing
transformations, which can be a tool for dealing with practical applica- tions.
