Genetic information is increasing exponentially, doubling every 18 months.
Analyzing this information within a reasonable amount of time requires parallel
computing resources. While considerable research has addressed DNA analysis
using GPUs, so far not much attention has been paid to the Intel Xeon Phi
coprocessor. In this paper we present an algorithm for large-scale DNA analysis
that exploits thread-level and the SIMD parallelism of the Intel Xeon Phi. We
evaluate our approach for various numbers of cores and thread allocation
affinities in the context of real-world DNA sequences of mouse, cat, dog,
chicken, human and turkey. The experimental results on Intel Xeon Phi show
speed-ups of up to 10x compared to a sequential implementation running on an
Intel Xeon processor E5.
