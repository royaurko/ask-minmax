We study the direct and inverse scattering problems when the incident
electromagnetic field is a time harmonic point- generated wave in a chiral
medium and the scatterer is a perfectly conducting sphere. The exact Green s
function and the electric far-field patterns of the scattering problem are
constructed. For a small sphere, a closed-form approximation of the scattered
wave field at the source of the incident spherical wave is obtained. These
near-field results lead to the solution of an inverse problem. We also treat
the same inverse problem using far-field results via the leading order term in
the low-frequency asymptotic expansion of the scattering cross-section.
