In this paper we prove log log type stability estimates for inverse boundary
value problems on admissible Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n \geq 3$. The
stability estimates correspond to a couple of uniqueness results by Dos Santos
Ferrera, Kenig, Salo and Uhlmann. These inverse problems arise naturally when
studying the anisotropic Calder\'on problem.
