The cycling operation endows the super summit set $S_x$ of any element $x$ of
a Garside group $G$ with the structure of a directed graph $\Gamma_x$. We
establish that the subset $U_x$ of $S_x$ consisting of the circuits of
$\Gamma_x$ can be used instead of $S_x$ for deciding conjugacy to $x$ in $G$,
yielding a faster and more practical solution to the conjugacy problem for
Garside groups. Moreover, we present a probabilistic approach to the conjugacy
search problem in Garside groups. The results are likely to have implications
for the security of recently proposed cryptosystems based on the hardness of
problems related to the conjugacy (search) problem in braid groups.
