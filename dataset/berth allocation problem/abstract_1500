We report mid-infrared (MIR) imaging observations of the carbon star U Ant
made with the Infrared Camera (IRC) on board AKARI. Subtraction of the
artifacts and extended PSF of the central star reveals the detached dust shell
around the carbon star at MIR wavelengths (15 and 24{\mu}m) for the first time.
The observed radial brightness profiles of the MIR emission are well explained
by two shells at 43" and 50" from the central star detected in optical
scattered light observations. Combining Herschel/PACS, AKARI/FIS, and AKARI/IRC
data, we obtain the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of the thermal
emission from the detached shell of U Ant in a wide infrared spectral range of
15- 160 {\mu}m. Thermal emission of amorphous carbon grains with a single
temperature cannot account for the observed SED from 15 to 160 {\mu}m: it
underestimates the emission at 15 {\mu}m. Alternatively, the observed SED is
fitted by the model that amorphous carbon grains in the two shells have
different temperatures of 60 and 104 K, which allocates most dust mass in the
shell at 50". This supports previous suggestion that the 43" shell is gas-rich
and the 50" one is dust-rich. We suggest a possibility that the segregation of
the gas and dust resulting from the drift motion of submicron-sized dust grains
relative to the gas and that the hot dust component associated with the
gas-rich shell is composed of very small grains that are strongly coupled with
the gas.
