Recently, a technique called beam-space MIMO has been demonstrated as an
effective approach for transmitting multiple signals while using a single
RF-chain. In this work, we present novel design considerations and a compact
antenna solution to stimulate the deployment of beam-space MIMO in future
wireless applications. Targeting integration in small wireless devices, the
novel antenna is made of a single integrated radiator rather than an array of
physically-separated dipoles. It also drastically simplifies the implementation
of variable loads and DC bias circuits for BPSK modulated signals, and does not
require any external reconfigurable matching circuit. Finally, we show that
this antenna system could be reconfigured by dynamic adjustment of terminating
loads to preserve its beam-space multiplexing capabilities over a 1:2 tuning
range, thereby promoting the convergence of MIMO and dynamic spectrum
allocation via reduced-complexity hardware. A prototype achieving
single-RF-chain multiplexing at a fixed frequency is designed and measured,
showing excellent agreement between simulations and measurements.
