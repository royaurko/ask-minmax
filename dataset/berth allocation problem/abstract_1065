With the help of an in-band full-duplex relay station, it is possible to
simultaneously transmit and receive signals from multiple users. The
performance of such system can be greatly increased when the relay station is
equipped with a large number of antennas on both transmitter and receiver
sides. In this paper, we exploit the use of massive arrays to effectively
suppress the loopback interference (LI) of a decode-and-forward relay (DF) and
evaluate the performance of the end-to-end (e2e) transmission. This paper
assumes imperfect channel state information is available at the relay and
designs a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) filter to mitigate the interference.
Subsequently, we adopt zero-forcing (ZF) filters for both detection and
beamforming. The performance of such system is evaluated in terms of bit error
rate (BER) at both relay and destinations, and an optimal choice for the
transmission power at the relay is shown. We then propose a complexity
efficient optimal power allocation (OPA) algorithm that, using the channel
statistics, computes the minimum power that satisfies the rate constraints of
each pair. The results obtained via simulation show that when both MMSE
filtering and OPA method are used, better values for the energy efficiency are
attained.
