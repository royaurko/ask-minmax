We study the efficiency of the proportional allocation mechanism, that is
widely used to allocate divisible resources. Each agent submits a bid for each
divisible resource and receives a fraction proportional to her bids. We
quantify the inefficiency of Nash equilibria by studying the Price of Anarchy
(PoA) of the induced game under complete and incomplete information. When
agents' valuations are concave, we show that the Bayesian Nash equilibria can
be arbitrarily inefficient, in contrast to the well-known 4/3 bound for pure
equilibria. Next, we upper bound the PoA over Bayesian equilibria by 2 when
agents' valuations are subadditive, generalizing and strengthening previous
bounds on lattice submodular valuations. Furthermore, we show that this bound
is tight and cannot be improved by any simple or scale-free mechanism. Then we
switch to settings with budget constraints, and we show an improved upper bound
on the PoA over coarse-correlated equilibria. Finally, we prove that the PoA is
exactly 2 for pure equilibria in the polyhedral environment.
