In this paper, a new technique for cross layer design, based on present Eb/N0
(bit energy per noise density) ratio of the connections and target values of
the Quality of Service (QoS) information parameters from MAC layer, is proposed
to dynamically select the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) at the PHY layer
for WiMAX Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) networks. The QoS information
parameter includes New Connection Blocking Probability (NCBP), Hand off
Connection Dropping Probability (HCDP) and Connection Outage Probability (COP).
In addition, a Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) based Call
Admission Control (CAC) algorithm and Queue based Scheduling algorithm are
integrated for the cross layer design. An analytical model using the Continuous
Time Markov Chain (CTMC) is developed for performance evaluation of the
algorithms under various MCS. The effect of Eb/No is observed for QoS
information parameters in order to determine its optimum range. Simulation
results show that the integrated CAC and packet Scheduling model maximizes the
bandwidth utilization and fair allocation of the system resources for all types
of MCS and guarantees the QoS to the connections.
