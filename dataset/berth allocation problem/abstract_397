This work considers coordination and bargaining between two selfish users
over a Gaussian interference channel using game theory. The usual information
theoretic approach assumes full cooperation among users for codebook and rate
selection. In the scenario investigated here, each selfish user is willing to
coordinate its actions only when an incentive exists and benefits of
cooperation are fairly allocated. To improve communication rates, the two users
are allowed to negotiate for the use of a simple Han-Kobayashi type scheme with
fixed power split and conditions for which users have incentives to cooperate
are identified. The Nash bargaining solution (NBS) is used as a tool to get
fair information rates. The operating point is obtained as a result of an
optimization problem and compared with a TDM-based one in the literature.
