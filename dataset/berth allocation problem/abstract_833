The Friedman's urn model is a popular urn model which is widely used in many
disciplines. In particular, it is extensively used in treatment allocation
schemes in clinical trials. In this paper, we prove that both the urn
composition process and the allocation proportion process can be approximated
by a multi-dimensional Gaussian process almost surely for a multi-color
generalized Friedman's urn model with non-homogeneous generating matrices. The
Gaussian process is a solution of a stochastic differential equation. This
Gaussian approximation together with the properties of the Gaussian process is
important for the understanding of the behavior of the urn process and is also
useful for statistical inferences. As an application, we obtain the asymptotic
properties including the asymptotic normality and the law of the iterated
logarithm for a multi-color generalized Friedman's urn model as well as the
randomized-play-the-winner rule as a special case.
