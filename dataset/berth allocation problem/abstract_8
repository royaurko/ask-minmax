Workflow technology is widely used to facilitate the business process in
enterprise information systems (EIS), and it has the potential to reduce design
time, enhance product quality and decrease product cost. However, significant
limitations still exist: as an important task in the context of workflow, many
present resource allocation operations are still performed manually, which are
time-consuming. This paper presents a data mining approach to address the
resource allocation problem (RAP) and improve the productivity of workflow
resource management. Specifically, an Apriori-like algorithm is used to find
the frequent patterns from the event log, and association rules are generated
according to predefined resource allocation constraints. Subsequently, a
correlation measure named lift is utilized to annotate the negatively
correlated resource allocation rules for resource reservation. Finally, the
rules are ranked using the confidence measures as resource allocation rules.
Comparative experiments are performed using C4.5, SVM, ID3, Na\"ive Bayes and
the presented approach, and the results show that the presented approach is
effective in both accuracy and candidate resource recommendations.
