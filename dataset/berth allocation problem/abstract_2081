I review the recent 5D self-tuning solutions of the cosmological constant
problem, and try to unify two cosmological constant problems within the
framework of the self-tuning solutions. One problem, the large cosmological
constant needed for inflation, is interpreted by starting with the parameters
allowing only the dS vacuum, and the vanishing cosmological constant at a true
vacuum is realized by changing parameters by exit from inflation at the brane
such that the self-tuning solution is allowed.
