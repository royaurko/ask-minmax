We consider second order elliptic divergence form systems with complex
measurable coefficients $A$ that are independent of the transversal coordinate,
and prove that the set of $A$ for which the boundary value problem with $L_2$
Dirichlet or Neumann data is well posed, is an open set. Furthermore we prove
that these boundary value problems are well posed when $A$ is either Hermitean,
block or constant. Our methods apply to more general systems of PDEs and as an
example we prove perturbation results for boundary value problems for
differential forms.
