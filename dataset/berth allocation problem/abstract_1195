This paper considers an amplify-and-forward relay network with fading states.
Amplify-and-forward scheme (along with its variations) is the core mechanism
for enabling cooperative communication in wireless networks, and hence
understanding the network stability region under amplify-and-forward scheme is
very important. However, in a relay network employing amplify-and-forward, the
interaction between nodes is described in terms of real-valued ``packets''
(signals) instead of discrete packets (bits). This restrains the relay nodes
from re-encoding the packets at desired rates. Hence, the stability analysis
for relay networks employing amplify-and-forward scheme is by no means a
straightforward extension of that in packet-based networks. In this paper, the
stability region of a four-node relay network is characterized, and a simple
throughput optimal algorithm with joint scheduling and rate allocation is
proposed.
