In AAMAS 2014, Bouveret and Lemaitre (2014) presented a hierarchy of fairness
concepts for allocation of indivisible objects. Among them CEEI (Competitive
Equilibrium with Equal Incomes) was the strongest. In this note, we settle the
complexity of computing a discrete CEEI assignment by showing it is strongly
NP-hard. We then highlight a fairness notion (CEEI-FRAC) that is even stronger
than CEEI for discrete assignments, is always Pareto optimal, and can be
verified in polynomial time. We also show that computing a CEEI-FRAC discrete
assignment is strongly NP-hard in general but polynomial-time computable if the
utilities are zero or one.
