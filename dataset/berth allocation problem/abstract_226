We provide a mathematical model to investigate the human resource allocation
problem for agents, say, university graduates who are looking for their
positions in labor markets. The basic model is described by the so-called Potts
spin glass which is well-known in the research field of statistical physics. In
the model, each Potts spin (a tiny magnet in atomic scale length) represents
the action of each student, and it takes a discrete variable corresponding to
the company he/she applies for. We construct the energy to include three
distinct effects on the students' behavior, namely, collective effect, market
history and international ranking of companies. In this model system, the
correlations (the adjacent matrix) between students are taken into account
through the pairwise spin-spin interactions. We carry out computer simulations
to examine the efficiency of the model. We also show that some chiral
representation of the Potts spin enables us to obtain some analytical insights
into our labor markets.
