Based on the erasure channel FEC model as defined in multimedia wireless
broadcast standards, we illustrate how doping mechanisms included in the design
of erasure coding and decoding may improve the scalability of the packet
throughput, decrease overall latency and potentially differentiate among
classes of multimedia subscribers regardless of their signal quality. We
describe decoding mechanisms that allow for linear complexity and give
complexity bounds when feedback is available. We show that elaborate coding
schemes which include pre-coding stages are inferior to simple Ideal Soliton
based rateless codes, combined with the proposed two-phase decoder. The
simplicity of this scheme and the availability of tight bounds on latency given
pre-allocated radio resources makes it a practical and efficient design
solution.
