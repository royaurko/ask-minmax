The quality of service (QoS) requirements are usually different from user to
user in a multiaccess system, and it is necessary to take the different
requirements into account when allocating the shared resources of the system.
In this paper, we consider one QoS criterion--delay in a multiaccess system,
and we combine information theory and queueing theory in an attempt to analyze
whether a multiaccess system can meet the different delay requirements of
users. For users with the same transmission power, we prove that only $N$
inequalities are necessary for the checking, and for users with different
transmission powers, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for such a
decision. In cases where the system cannot satisfy the delay requirements of
all users, we prove that as long as the sum power is larger than a threshold,
there is always an approach to adjust the transmission power of each user to
make the system delay feasible if power reallocation is available.
