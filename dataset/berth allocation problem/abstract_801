When the available statistical information is imperfect, it is dangerous to
follow standard optimisation procedures to construct an optimal portfolio,
which usually leads to a strong concentration of the weights on very few
assets. We propose a new way, based on generalised entropies, to ensure a
minimal degree of diversification.
