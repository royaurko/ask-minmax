We prove that the problem of computing an Arrow-Debreu market equilibrium is
PPAD-complete even when all traders use additively separable, piecewise-linear
and concave utility functions. In fact, our proof shows that this
market-equilibrium problem does not have a fully polynomial-time approximation
scheme unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time.
