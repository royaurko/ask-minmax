We propose a novel stochastic radio resource allocation strategy that
achieves long-term fairness considering backhaul and air-interface capacity
limitations. The base station is considered to be only powered with a finite
battery that is recharged by an energy harvesting source. Such energy
harvesting is also taken into account in the proposed resource allocation
strategy. This technical scenario can be found in remote rural areas where the
backhaul connection is very limited and the base stations are fed with solar
panels of reduced size. Our results show that the proposed scheme achieves
higher fairness among the users and, in some cases, a higher sum-rate compared
with the well-known proportional fair scheduler.
