In this paper, we study the problem of determining a minimum state
probabilistic finite state machine capable of generating statistically
identical symbol sequences to samples provided. This problem is qualitatively
similar to the classical Hidden Markov Model problem and has been studied from
a practical point of view in several works beginning with the work presented
in: Shalizi, C.R., Shalizi, K.L., Crutchfield, J.P. (2002) [arXiv:cs/0210025].
In this paper, we show that the underlying problem is $\mathrm{NP}$-hard and
thus all existing polynomial time algorithms must be approximations on finite
data sets. Using our $\mathrm{NP}$-hardness proof, we show how to construct a
provably correct algorithm for constructing a minimum state probabilistic
finite state machine given data and empirically study its running time.
