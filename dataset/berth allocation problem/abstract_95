We analyze properties of apportionment functions in context of the problem of
allocating seats in the European Parliament. Necessary and sufficient
conditions for apportionment functions are investigated. Some exemplary
families of apportionment functions are specified and the corresponding
partitions of the seats in the European Parliament among the Member States of
the European Union are presented. Although the choice of the allocation
functions is theoretically unlimited, we show that the constraints are so
strong that the acceptable functions lead to rather similar solutions.
