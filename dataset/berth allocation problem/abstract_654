Energy efficiency is a growing concern for wireless networks, not only due to
the emerging traffic demand from smart devices, but also because of the
dependence on the traditional unsustainable energy and the overall
environmental concerns. The urgent call for reducing power consumption while
meeting system requirements has motivated increasing research efforts on green
radio. In this paper, we investigate a new joint spectrum and power allocation
scheme for a cooperative downlink multi-user system using the frequency
division multiple access scheme, in which arbitrary M base stations (BSs)
coordinately allocate their resources to each user equipment (UE). With the
assumption that multi-BS UE (user being served by multi-BS) would require the
same amount of spectrum from these BSs, we conclude that when the number of
multi-BS UEs is limited by M-1, the resource allocation scheme can always
guarantee the minimum overall transmit power consumption while meeting the
throughput requirement of each UE and also each BS's power constraint. Then, to
decide the clusters of multi-BS UEs and the clusters of individual-BS UEs
(users being served by individual BSs), we propose a UE-BS association scheme
and a complexity reduction scheme. Finally, a novel joint spectrum and power
allocation algorithm is proposed to minimize the total power consumption.
Simulation results are presented to verify the optimality of the derived
schemes.
