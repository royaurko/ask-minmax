The wave scattering by moving particles (dynamic scattering) is a well known
physical problem routinely occurring in practice. For the particles which are
much smaller than the incident wavelength, the static scattering problem can be
solved by using the local perturbation method. In this paper we apply the local
perturbation approach to the problem of the dynamic scattering by the cluster
of small particles. We calculate the fields scattered by the cluster of moving
particles. As an example, the scattered field is calculated for moving sphere
in scalar approximation and in vector case.
