A media platform's policy on obtrusive ads mediates an effectiveness-nuisance
tradeoff. Allowing more obtrusive advertising can increase the effectiveness of
ads, so the platform can elicit more short-term revenue from advertisers, but
the nuisance to viewers can decrease their engagement over time, which
decreases the platform's opportunity for future revenue. To optimize long-term
revenue, a platform can use a combination of advertiser bids and ad impact on
user experience to price and allocate ad space.
  We study the conditions for advertisers, viewers, and the platform to
simultaneously benefit from using ad impact on user experience as a criterion
for ad selection and pricing. It is important for advertisers to benefit,
because media platforms compete with one another for advertisers. Our results
show that platforms with more advertisers competing for ad space are more
likely to generate increased profits for themselves and their advertisers by
introducing ad impact on user experience as a factor in their auction
mechanisms. As a result, doing so can be a successful strategy in competition
against other platforms.
