We consider the discrete assignment problem in which agents express ordinal
preferences over objects and these objects are allocated to the agents in a
fair manner. We use the stochastic dominance relation between fractional or
randomized allocations to systematically define varying notions of
proportionality and envy-freeness for discrete assignments. The computational
complexity of checking whether a fair assignment exists is studied for these
fairness notions. We also characterize the conditions under which a fair
assignment is guaranteed to exist. For a number of fairness concepts,
polynomial-time algorithms are presented to check whether a fair assignment
exists. Our algorithmic results also extend to the case of unequal entitlements
of agents. Our NP-hardness result, which holds for several variants of
envy-freeness, answers an open question posed by Bouveret, Endriss, and Lang
(ECAI 2010). We also propose fairness concepts that always suggest a non-empty
set of assignments with meaningful fairness properties. Among these concepts,
optimal proportionality and optimal weak proportionality appear to be desirable
fairness concepts.
