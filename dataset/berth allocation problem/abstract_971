In the forthcoming ISDA Standard Credit Support Annex (SCSA), the trades
denominated in non-G5 currencies as well as those include multiple currencies
are expected to be allocated to the USD silo, where the contracts are
collateralized by USD cash, or a different currency with an appropriate
interest rate overlay to achieve the same economic effects. In this paper, we
have presented a simple generic valuation framework for the clean price under
the USD silo with the the detailed procedures for the initial term structure
construction. We have also shown that Cross Currency Swap (CCS) basis spread
can be expressed as a difference between two swap rates.
