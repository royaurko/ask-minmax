Auctions have been proposed as a way to provide economic incentives for
primary users to dynamically allocate unused spectrum to other users in need of
it. Previously proposed schemes do not take into account the fact that the
power constraints of users might prevent them from transmitting their bid
prices to the auctioneer with high precision and that transmitted bid prices
must travel through a noisy channel. These schemes also have very high
overheads which cannot be accommodated in wireless standards. We propose
auction schemes where a central clearing contributority auctions spectrum to users
who bid for it, while taking into account quantization of prices, overheads in
bid revelation, and noise in the channel explicitly. Our schemes are closely
related to channel output feedback problems and, specifically, to the technique
of posterior matching. We consider several scenarios where the objective of the
clearing contributority is to award spectrum to the bidders who value spectrum the
most. We prove theoretically that this objective is asymptotically attained by
our scheme when the bidders are non-strategic with constant bids. We propose
separate schemes to make strategic users reveal their private values
truthfully, to auction multiple sub-channels among strategic users, and to
track slowly time-varying bid prices. Our simulations illustrate the optimality
of our schemes for constant bid prices, and also demonstrate the effectiveness
of our tracking algorithm for slowly time-varying bids.
