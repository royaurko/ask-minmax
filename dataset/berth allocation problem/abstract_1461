Performance of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes is analyzed with
dual-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relaying systems over mixed $\eta$-$\mu$ and
$\kappa$-$\mu$ fading channels. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the
average symbol error rate (ASER) for general order rectangular QAM and cross
QAM schemes using moment generating function based approach. Derived
expressions are in the form of Lauricella's $(F_D^{(n)}(\cdot),
\Phi_1^{(n)}(\cdot))$ hypergeometric functions which can be numerically
evaluated using either integral or series representation. The obtained ASER
expressions include other mixed fading channel cases addressed in the
literature as special cases such as mixed Hoyt, and Rice fading, mixed
Nakagami-$m$, and Rice fading. We further obtain a simple expression for the
asymptotic ASER, which is useful to determine a factor governing the system
performance at high SNRs, i.e., the diversity order. Additionally, we analyze
the optimal power allocation, which provides a practical design rule to
optimally distribute the total transmission power between the source and the
relay to minimize the ASER. Extensive numerical and computer simulation results
are presented that confirm the accuracy of presented mathematical analysis.
