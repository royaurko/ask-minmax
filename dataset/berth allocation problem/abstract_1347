Power line communications (PLC) has been drawing considerable interest in
recent years due to the growing interest in smart grid implementation.
Specifically, network control and grid applications are allocated the frequency
band of 0-500 kHz, commonly referred to as the narrowband PLC channel. This
frequency band is characterized by strong periodic noise which results in low
signal to noise ratio (SNR). In this work we propose a receiver which uses
frequency shift filtering to exploit the cyclostationary properties of both the
narrowband power line noise, as well as the information signal, digitally
modulated using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. An adaptive
implementation for the proposed receiver is presented as well. The proposed
receiver is compared to existing receivers via analysis and simulation. The
results show that the receiver proposed in this work obtains a substantial
performance gain over previously proposed receivers, without requiring any
coordination with the transmitter.
