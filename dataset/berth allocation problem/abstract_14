This letter studies the power allocation and scheduling problem in two-cell
distributed interference subtraction system. Through the interference is
cancelled at one receiver side and the analysis of objective function monotony,
our key result is the decoupling of power allocation and scheduling without
loss of optimality. Simulation exhibits the significant gains of our proposed
algorithm over open-loop power allocation with non-cooperation proportional
fair scheduling.
