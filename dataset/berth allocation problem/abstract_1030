The constantly increasing demand for interactive broadband satellite
communications is driving current research to explore novel system
architectures that reuse frequency in a more aggressive manner. To this end,
the topic of dual satellite systems, in which satellites share spatial (i.e.
same coverage area) and spectral (i.e. full frequency reuse) degrees of freedom
is introduced. In each multibeam satellite, multiuser interferences are
mitigated by employing zero forcing precoding with realistic per antenna power
constraints. However, the two sets of users that the transmitters are
separately serving, interfere. The present contribution, proposes the partial
cooperation, namely coordination between the two coexisting transmitters in
order to reduce interferences and enhance the performance of the whole system,
while maintaining moderate system complexity. In this direction, a heuristic,
iterative, low complexity algorithm that allocates users in the two interfering
sets is proposed. This novel algorithm, improves the performance of each
satellite and of the overall system, simultaneously. The first is achieved by
maximizing the orthogonality between users allocated in the same set, hence
optimizing the zero forcing performance, whilst the second by minimizing the
level of interferences between the two sets. Simulation results show that the
proposed method, compared to conventional techniques, significantly increases
spectral efficiency.
