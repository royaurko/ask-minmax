This paper deals with the automated synthesis of implementations of
knowledge-based programs with respect to two synchronous semantics (clock and
synchronous perfect recall). An approach to the synthesis problem based on the
use of symbolic representations is described. The method has been implemented
as an extension to the model checker MCK. Two applications of the implemented
synthesis system are presented: the muddy children puzzle (where performance is
compared to an explicit state method for a related problem implemented in the
model checker DEMO), and a knowledge-based program for a dynamic leader
election problem in a ring of processes.
