In this paper, we address distributed convergence to fair allocations of CPU
resources for time-sensitive applications. We propose a novel resource
management framework where a centralized objective for fair allocations is
decomposed into a pair of performance-driven recursive processes for updating:
(a) the allocation of computing bandwidth to the applications (resource
adaptation), executed by the resource manager, and (b) the service level of
each application (service-level adaptation), executed by each application
independently. We provide conditions under which the distributed recursive
scheme exhibits convergence to solutions of the centralized objective (i.e.,
fair allocations). Contrary to prior work on centralized optimization schemes,
the proposed framework exhibits adaptivity and robustness to changes both in
the number and nature of applications, while it assumes minimum information
available to both applications and the resource manager. We finally validate
our framework with simulations using the TrueTime toolbox in MATLAB/Simulink.
