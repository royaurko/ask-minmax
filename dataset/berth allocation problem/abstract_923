In a cooperative spectrum sharing (CSS) protocol, two wireless systems
operate over the same frequency band albeit with different priorities. The
secondary (or cognitive) system which has a lower priority, helps the higher
priority primary system to achieve its target rate by acting as a relay and
allocating a fraction of its power to forward the primary signal. The secondary
system in return is benefited by transmitting its own data on primary system's
spectrum. In this paper, we have analyzed the performance of multiple antenna
cooperative spectrum sharing protocol under Nakagami-m Fading. Closed form
expressions for outage probability have been obtained by varying the parameters
m and Omega of the Nakagami-m fading channels. Apart from above, we have shown
the impact of power allocation factor (alpha) and parameter m on the region of
secondary spectrum access, conventionally defined as critical radius for the
secondary system. A comparison between theoretical and simulated results is
also presented to corroborate the theoretical results obtained in this paper
