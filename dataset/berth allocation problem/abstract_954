When the natural frequencies are allocated symmetrically in the Kuramoto
model there exists an invariant torus of dimension [N/2]+1 (N is the population
size). A global phase shift invariance allows to reduce the model to $N-1$
dimensions using the phase differences, and doing so the invariant torus
becomes [N/2]-dimensional. By means of perturbative calculations based on the
renormalization group technique, we show that this torus is asymptotically
stable at small coupling if N is odd. If N is even the torus can be stable or
unstable depending on the natural frequencies, and both possibilities persist
in the small coupling limit.
