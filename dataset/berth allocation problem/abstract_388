The problem of resource allocation is studied for two-sender two-receiver
fading Gaussian interference channels (IFCs) and compound multiaccess channels
(C-MACs). The senders in an IFC communicate with their own receiver (unicast)
while those in a C-MAC communicate with both receivers (multicast). The
instantaneous fading state between every transmit-receive pair in this network
is assumed to be known at all transmitters and receivers. Under an average
power constraint at each source, the sum-capacity of the C-MAC and the power
policy that achieves this capacity is developed. The conditions defining the
classes of strong and very strong ergodic IFCs are presented and the multicast
sum-capacity is shown to be tight for both classes.
