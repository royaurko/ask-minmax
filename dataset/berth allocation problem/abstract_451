This paper proposes a jointly cooperative relay and jamming protocol based on
full-duplex (FD) capable relay to increase the source-destination secrecy rate
in the presence of different types of eavesdroppers. In this so called
\textit{FD-Relay with jamming (FDJ)} protocol, the FD-Relay, first,
simultaneously receives data and sends jamming to the eavesdropper, and, then,
forwards the data, while the source jams the eavesdropper. Achievable secrecy
rates of the proposed FDJ in presence of different eavesdropper types and
self-interference (SI) are derived and compared with those of the traditional
half-duplex (HD) relay. The adaptive power allocation for secrecy rate
maximization in a multi-carrier scenario for both proposed FDJ and HD-Relay is
formulated as a non-convex optimization problem and corresponding iterative
solution algorithm is developed using the difference-of-two-concave-functions
(DC) programming technique. The simulation results confirm that FDJ offers
significant improvements in the secrecy rate over the HD-Relay.
