In this paper, we study a classification problem in which sample labels are
randomly corrupted. In this scenario, there is an unobservable sample with
noise-free labels. However, before being observed, the true labels are
independently flipped with a probability $\rho\in[0,0.5)$, and the random label
noise can be class-conditional. Here, we address two fundamental problems
raised by this scenario. The first is how to best use the abundant surrogate
loss functions designed for the traditional classification problem when there
is label noise. We prove that any surrogate loss function can be used for
classification with noisy labels by using importance reweighting, with
consistency assurance that the label noise does not ultimately hinder the
search for the optimal classifier of the noise-free sample. The other is the
open problem of how to obtain the noise rate $\rho$. We show that the rate is
upper bounded by the conditional probability $P(y|x)$ of the noisy sample.
Consequently, the rate can be estimated, because the upper bound can be easily
reached in classification problems. Experimental results on synthetic and real
datasets confirm the efficiency of our methods.
