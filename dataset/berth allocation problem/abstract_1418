In this paper, we establish a dynamic game to allocate CSR (Corporate Social
Responsibility) to the members of a supply chain. We propose a model of
three-tier supply chain in decentralized state that is including supplier,
manufacturer and retailer. For analyzing supply chain performance in
decentralized state and the relationships between the members of supply chain,
we use Stackelberg game and we consider in this paper a hierarchical
equilibrium solution for a two-level game. Specially, we formulate a model that
crosses through multi-periods by a dynamic discreet Stackelberg game. We try to
obtain an equilibrium point at where both the profits of members and the level
of CSR taken by supply chains are maximized.
