This paper deals with a class of singularly perturbed nonlinear elliptic
problems $(P_\e)$ with subcritical nonlinearity.
  The coefficient of the linear part is assumed to concentrate in a point of
the domain, as $\e\to 0$, and the domain is supposed to be unbounded and with
unbounded boundary.
  Domains that enlarge at infinity, and whose boundary flattens or shrinks at
infinity, are considered.
  It is proved that in such domains problem $(P_\e)$ has at least 2 solutions.
