In this paper, full-duplex radios are used to continuously update the channel
state information at the transmitter, which is required to compute the downlink
precoding matrix in MIMO broadcast channels. The full-duplex operation allows
leveraging channel reciprocity for open-loop uplink training to estimate the
downlink channels. However, the uplink transmission of training creates
interference at the downlink receiving mobile nodes. We characterize the
optimal training resource allocation and its associated spectral efficiency, in
the proposed open-loop training based full-duplex system. We also evaluate the
performance of the half-duplex counterpart to derive the relative gains of
full-duplex training. Despite the existence of inter-node interference due to
full-duplex, significant spectral efficiency improvement is attained over
half-duplex operation.
