We present a stable and convergent method for solving initial value problems
based on the use of differentiation matrices obtained by Lagrange
interpolation. This implicit multistep-like method is easy-to-use and performs
pretty well in the solution of mildly stiff problems and it can also be applied
directly to differential problems in the complex plane.
