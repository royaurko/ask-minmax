Recently acquired near-IR imaging (J and Ks) of low surface brightness
galaxies is presented. The data includes 52 galaxies with log[MHI/Msolar] < 9.0
and 58 galaxies with log[MHI/Msolar] > 9.5. These galaxies have been selected
from the catalogue of Impey et al. (1996), and all of them are observable from
both hemispheres. The principal goal of this research is to investigate the
poorly understood giant and old stellar content of these galaxies. Current work
includes total and isophotal photometry, and comparison with spectrophotometric
models of galaxy evolution, including the role of age and metallicity. Already
allocated observing time at Las Campanas Observatory will provide high S/N B
and I imaging.
