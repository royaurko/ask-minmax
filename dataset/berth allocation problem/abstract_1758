We provide a survey of results concerning both the direct and inverse
problems to the Cauchy-Davenport theorem and Erdos-Heilbronn problem in
Additive Combinatorics. We prove a slight extension to an inverse theorem of
Dias da Silva-Hamidoune in Z/pZ, and we present a counterexample to an open
conjecture concerning the inverse Erdos-Heilbronn problem in nonabelian groups.
