In this paper, an open problem in the multidimensional complex analysis is
pesented that arises in the investigation of the regularity properties of
Fourier integral operators and in the regularity theory for hyperbolic partial
differential equations. The problem is discussed in a self-contained elementary
way and some results towards its resolution are presented. A conjecture
concerning the structure of appearing affine fibrations is formulated.
