We examine the behavior of the coefficients of powers of polynomials over a
finite field of prime order. Extending the work of Allouche-Berthe, 1997, we
study a(n), the number of occurring strings of length n among coefficients of
any power of a polynomial f reduced modulo a prime p. The sequence of line
complexity a(n) is p-regular in the sense of Allouche-Shalit. For f=1+x and
general p, we derive a recursion relation for a(n) then find a new formula for
the generating function for a(n). We use the generating function to compute the
asymptotics of a(n)/n^2 as n approaches infinity, which is an explicitly
computable piecewise quadratic in x with n= [p^m/x] and x is a real number
between 1/p and 1. Analyzing other cases, we form a conjecture about the
generating function for general a(n). We examine the matrix B associated with f
and p used to compute the count of a coefficient, which applies to the theory
of linear cellular automata and fractals. For p=2 and polynomials of small
degree we compute the largest positive eigenvalue, \lambda, of B, related to
the fractal dimension d of the corresponding fractal by d= \log_2(\lambda). We
find proofs and make a number of conjectures for some bounds on \lambda, and
upper bounds on its degree.
