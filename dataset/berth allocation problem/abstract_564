We present a regularized logistic regression model for evaluating player
contributions in hockey. The traditional metric for this purpose is the
plus-minus statistic, which allocates a single unit of credit (for or against)
to each player on the ice for a goal. However, plus-minus scores measure only
the marginal effect of players, do not account for sample size, and provide a
very noisy estimate of performance. We investigate a related regression
problem: what does each player on the ice contribute, beyond aggregate team
performance and other factors, to the odds that a given goal was scored by
their team? Due to the large-p (number of players) and imbalanced design
setting of hockey analysis, a major part of our contribution is a careful
treatment of prior shrinkage in model estimation. We showcase two recently
developed techniques -- for posterior maximization or simulation -- that make
such analysis feasible. Each approach is accompanied with publicly available
software and we include the simple commands used in our analysis. Our results
show that most players do not stand out as measurably strong (positive or
negative) contributors. This allows the stars to really shine, reveals diamonds
in the rough overlooked by earlier analyses, and argues that some of the
highest paid players in the league are not making contributions worth their
expense.
