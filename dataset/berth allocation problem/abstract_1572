This paper extend the link between stochastic approximation and randomized
urn models investigated in Laruelle and Pag{\`e}s (AAP 2013) for application in
clinical trials introduced in Bai and Hu (AAP 2005) or Bai, Hu ans Shen (JMA
2002). The idea is that the drawing rule is no longer uniform among the balls
of the urn (which contains d colors), but can be reinforced by a function f
modeling in some sense aversion to risk. Firstly, by considering that f is
concave or convex and by reformulating the dynamics of the urn composition as a
standard stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm (with remainder), we derive
the a.s. convergence and the asymptotic normality (Central Limit Theorem, CLT)
of the normalized procedure by calling upon the so-called ODE and SDE methods.
An in-depth analysis of the case d=2 exhibits two different behaviours: a
single equilibrium point when f is concave, and when f is convex, a transition
phase from a single to a system with two attracting equilibrium points and a
repulsive one. The last setting is solved using results on noiseless traps in
order to remove the repulsive point and to deduce the a.s. towards one of the
attractive point. Secondly, the special case of a Polya urn (i.e. when the
addition rule the I\_d matrix) is analyzed, still using result form (SA) about
traps. Finally, these results are applied to functions with regular variation
and optimal asset allocation in Finance.
