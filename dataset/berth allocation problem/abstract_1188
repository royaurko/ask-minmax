We propose a multi-layer graphene-based device in which storage and release
of atomic hydrogen is obtained by exploiting and controlling the corrugation of
the layers. The proposal is based on density-functional simulations of hydrogen
chemisorption on graphene with superimposed corrugation. We report a tunability
of the binding energies of more than 2 eV by changing the sheet out-of-plane
deformation up to \pm 0.2 {\AA}, the convex regions allocating the
energetically favored hydrogen binding sites. We discuss an optimized process
of curvature inversion that can lead to efficient and fast hydrogen release and
H2 formation. Our corrugated graphene device can potentially reach gravimetric
capacities of ~8 wt % and reversibly store and release atomic hydrogen by
application of external fields without the need of modifying temperature and
pressure.
