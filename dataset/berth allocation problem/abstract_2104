Generalized entropic projections and dominating points are solutions to
convex minimization problems related to conditional laws of large numbers. They
appear in many areas of applied mathematics such as statistical physics,
information theory, mathematical statistics, ill-posed inverse problems or
large deviation theory. By means of convex conjugate duality and functional
analysis, criteria are derived for their existence. Representations of the
generalized entropic projections are obtained: they are the ``measure
component" of some extended entropy minimization problem.
