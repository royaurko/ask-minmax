Heinrich Behmann (1891-1970) obtained his Habilitation under David Hilbert in
G\"ottingen in 1921 with a thesis on the decision problem. In his thesis, he
solved-independently of L\"owenheim and Skolem's earlier work-the decision
problem for monadic second-order logic in a framework that combined elements of
the algebra of logic and the newer axiomatic approach to logic then being
developed in G\"ottingen. In a talk given in 1921, he outlined this solution,
but also presented important programmatic remarks on the significance of the
decision problem and of decision procedures more generally. The text of this
talk as well as a partial English translation are included.
