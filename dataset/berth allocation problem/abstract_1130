We propose a novel capacity model for complex networks against cascading
failure. In this model, vertices with both higher loads and larger degrees
should be paid more extra capacities, i.e. the allocation of extra capacity on
vertex $i$ will be proportional to $ k_{i}^{\gamma} $, where $ k_{i}$ is the
degree of vertex $i$ and $\gamma>0$ is a free parameter. We have applied this
model on Barab\'asi-Albert network as well as two real transportation networks,
and found that under the same amount of available resource, this model can
achieve better network robustness than previous models.
