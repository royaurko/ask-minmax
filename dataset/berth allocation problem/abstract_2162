Systematic application of software metric techniques can lead to significant
improvements of the quality of a final software product. However, there is
still the evident lack of wider utilization of software metrics techniques and
tools due to many reasons. In this paper we investigate some limitations of
contemporary software metrics tools and then propose construction of a new tool
that would solve some of the problems. We describe the promising prototype, its
internal structure, and then focus on its independency of the input language.
