In this paper the contributors describe the problem of acquisition of interfered
signals and formulate a filtering problem. A frequency-selective compressed
sensing technique is proposed as a solution to this problem. Signal acquisition
is critical in facilitating frequency-selective compressed sensing. The contributors
propose a filtering compressed sensing parameter, which allows to assess if a
given acquisition process makes frequency-selective compressed sensing possible
for a given filtering problem. A numerical experiment which shows how the
described method works in practice is conducted.
