We introduce the appropriate framework for pathwise comparison of multiple
server queues under general stationary ergodic assumptions. In particular, we
show in what sense it is better to have more servers for a system under FCFS
(First Come, First Served) or equivalently, more queues in a system of parallel
queues under the JSW (Join the Shortest Workload) allocation policy. These
comparison results are based on the recursive reprsentation of Kiefer and
Wolfowitz, and on a non-mass conservative generalization of the Schur-Convex
semi-ordering.
