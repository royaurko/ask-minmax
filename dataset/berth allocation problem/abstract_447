Smart city [1] planning is crucial as it should balance among resources and
the needs of the city .It allows to achieve good eco-friendly industries, there
by supporting both the nature and the stake holders. Setting up an industry is
a difficult problem, because it should optimize the resources and allocating it
in an effective manner. Weighted sum approach [2] uses the spatial data for
finding appropriate places to set up the industry based on the weight assigned
to each constraint. The user can predict the possible places in the search
space, where the industry can be set with low time complexity using spatial
data. Diversity being introduced by using multipoint crossover and mutation
operations. It will help to bring exploration in the search space, thereby
bring the diversity factor into the solution space. The prediction approach
will help to avoid the human exploitation on nature for resources. This in turn
helps the investors to maximize the Return on Investment (ROI).
