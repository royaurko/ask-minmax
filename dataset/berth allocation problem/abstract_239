In this paper, we consider simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
systems with the coexistence of information receivers (IRs) and energy
receivers (ERs). The IRs are served with best-effort secrecy data and the ERs
harvest energy with minimum required harvested power. To enhance physical-layer
security and yet satisfy energy harvesting requirements, we introduce a new
frequency-domain artificial noise based approach. We study the optimal resource
allocation for the weighted sum secrecy rate maximization via transmit power
and subcarrier allocation. The considered problem is non-convex, while we
propose an efficient algorithm for solving it based on Lagrange duality method.
Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm as
compared against other heuristic schemes.
