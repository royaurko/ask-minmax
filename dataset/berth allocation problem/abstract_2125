The Cauchy problem for metric-affine f(R)-gravity `a la Palatini and with
torsion, in presence of perfect fluid matter acting as source, is discussed
following the well-known Bruhat prescriptions for General Relativity. The
problem results well-formulated and well-posed when the perfect-fluid form of
the stress-energy tensor is preserved under conformal transformations. The key
role of conservation laws in Jordan and in Einstein frame is also discussed.
