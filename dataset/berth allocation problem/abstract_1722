How can we remove some interactions in a constraint satisfaction problem
(CSP) such that it still remains satisfiable? In this paper we study a modified
survey propagation algorithm that enables us to address this question for a
prototypical CSP, i.e. random K-satisfiability problem. The average number of
removed interactions is controlled by a tuning parameter in the algorithm. If
the original problem is satisfiable then we are able to construct satisfiable
subproblems ranging from the original one to a minimal one with minimum
possible number of interactions. The minimal satisfiable subproblems will
provide directly the solutions of the original problem.
