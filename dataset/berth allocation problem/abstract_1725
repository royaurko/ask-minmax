Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is a powerful tool for planning and
control problems because of its modeling capability and the availability of
good solvers. However, for large models, MILP methods suffer computationally.
In this paper, we present iterative MILP algorithms that address this issue. We
consider trajectory generation problems with obstacle avoidance requirements
and minimum time trajectory generation problems. The algorithms use fewer
binary variables than standard MILP methods and require less computational
effort.
