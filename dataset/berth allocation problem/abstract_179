In this paper, we investigate the distributed power allocation for multi-cell
OFDMA networks taking both energy efficiency and inter-cell interference (ICI)
mitigation into account. A performance metric termed as throughput contribution
is exploited to measure how ICI is effectively coordinated. To achieve a
distributed power allocation scheme for each base station (BS), the throughput
contribution of each BS to the network is first given based on a pricing
mechanism. Different from existing works, a biobjective problem is formulated
based on multi-objective optimization theory, which aims at maximizing the
throughput contribution of the BS to the network and minimizing its total power
consumption at the same time. Using the method of Pascoletti and Serafini
scalarization, the relationship between the varying parameters and minimal
solutions is revealed. Furthermore, to exploit the relationship an algorithm is
proposed based on which all the solutions on the boundary of the efficient set
can be achieved by adaptively adjusting the involved parameters. With the
obtained solution set, the decision maker has more choices on power allocation
schemes in terms of both energy consumption and throughput. Finally, the
performance of the algorithm is assessed by the simulation results.
