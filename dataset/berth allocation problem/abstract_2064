Recently a new class of numerical integration methods -- ``mixed variable
symplectic integrators'' -- has been introduced for studying long-term
evolution in the conservative gravitational few-body problem. These integrators
are an order of magnitude faster than conventional ODE integration methods.
Here I present a simple modification of this method to include small
non-gravitational forces. The new scheme provides a similar advantage of
computational speed for a larger class of problems in Solar System dynamics.
