The Cambridge Compromise composition of the European Parliament allocates
five base seats to each Member State's citizenry, and apportions the remaining
seats proportionately to population figures using the divisor method with
rounding upwards and observing a 96 seat capping. The power-weighted variant
avoids the capping step, proceeding instead by a progressive non-linear
downweighting of the population figures until the largest State is allocated
exactly 96 seats. The pertinent calculations of the variant are described, and
its relative constitutional merits are discussed.
