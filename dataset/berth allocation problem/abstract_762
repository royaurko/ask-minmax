VANETs are considered as networks of critical future importance, with the
main concern being the safety of travelers and infrastructure. A lot of methods
for coordination and channel allocation in the context of VANETs are being
introduced. As such, the need of a framework to reliably compare the relative
performances of different channel sensing, allocation and coordination schemes
which takes into account the movement of vehicles is felt. In this paper, we
introduce a framework that can be used to define and compare such schemes in a
variety of scenarios. Simulation results clearly show the robustness of our
technique by eliminating the misdetections and reducing to a great extent the
false alarms.
