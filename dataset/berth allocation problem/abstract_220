The design of next generation wireless networks is strongly motivated by the
need to improve network energy efficiency (EE), while ensuring that the
provided performance, often expressed in terms of spectral efficiency (SE),
satisfies the vastly increasing user demands. In this context, this paper
discusses about the SE-EE trade-off in Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple
Access (OFDMA) wireless networks, achieved by an optimal joint resource
allocation of transmit power and bandwidth on the system downlink direction. A
novel theoretical framework is presented initially for the study of a single
cell scenario, where a traffic repartition scheme is proposed that simplifies
the inherent optimization problem and reveals useful insights. Special
attention is also given to the case of the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and
a way to easily evaluate the upper bound of EE in this regime is provided.
Finally, by exploiting useful properties of stochastic geometry, this work is
extended to a more challenging multi-cell environment, where interference is
shown to play an essential role. For this reason, several potential
interference reduction techniques are investigated in order to enhance the
performance of the SE-EE trade-off curves.
