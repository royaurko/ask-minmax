This paper gives a brief overview on the nonparametric techniques that are
useful for financial econometric problems. The problems include estimation and
inferences of instantaneous returns and volatility functions of
time-homogeneous and time-dependent diffusion processes, and estimation of
transition densities and state price densities. We first briefly describe the
problems and then outline main techniques and main results. Some useful
probabilistic aspects of diffusion processes are also briefly summarized to
facilitate our presentation and applications.
