This paper studies an energy efficient design of precoders for point-to-point
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Differently from traditional approaches, the
optimal power allocation strategy is studied by modelling the circuit power as
a rate-dependent function. We show that if the circuit power is a constant plus
an increasing and convex function of the transmission rate, the problem of
minimizing the consumed energy per bit received can be reformulated as a convex
fractional program and solved by means of a bisection algorithm. The impact of
the some system parameters is investigated either analytically or by means of
computational results.
