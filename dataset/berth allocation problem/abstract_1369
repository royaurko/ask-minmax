Emerging empirical and theoretical thinking about human aging places
considerable value upon the role of the environment as a major factor which can
promote prolonged healthy longevity. Our contemporary, information-rich
environment is taken to mean not merely the actual physical surroundings of a
person but it is also considered in a more abstract sense, to denote cultural,
societal and technological influences. Our modern environment is far from being
static or stable. In fact, it is continually changing in an exponential manner,
necessitating constant adaptive responses on behalf of our developmental and
evolutionary mechanisms. In this paper, I attempt to describe how a continual,
balanced and meaningful exposure to a stimulating environment, including
exposure to information-that-requires-action (but NOT trivial information), has
direct or indirect repercussions on epigenetic mechanisms which may then act to
prolong healthy longevity. Information gained from our environment acts as a
hormetic stimulus which up-regulates biological responses and feedback loops,
eventually leading to improved repair of age-related damage. The consequence of
this biological information-processing mechanism may influence resource
allocation and redress the imbalance between somatic cell versus germ-line cell
repairs. This can eventually have evolutionary consequences resulting in the
drastic reduction of age-related disease and degeneration.
