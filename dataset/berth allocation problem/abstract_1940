This paper analyzes the relative advantages between crossover and mutation on
a class of deterministic and stochastic additively separable problems. This
study assumes that the recombination and mutation operators have the knowledge
of the building blocks (BBs) and effectively exchange or search among competing
BBs. Facetwise models of convergence time and population sizing have been used
to determine the scalability of each algorithm. The analysis shows that for
additively separable deterministic problems, the BB-wise mutation is more
efficient than crossover, while the crossover outperforms the mutation on
additively separable problems perturbed with additive Gaussian noise. The
results show that the speed-up of using BB-wise mutation on deterministic
problems is O(k^{0.5}logm), where k is the BB size, and m is the number of BBs.
Likewise, the speed-up of using crossover on stochastic problems with fixed
noise variance is O(mk^{0.5}log m).
