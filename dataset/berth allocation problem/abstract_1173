The adoption of market-based principles in resource management systems for
computational infrastructures such as grids and clusters allows for matching
demand and supply for resources in a utility maximizing manner. As such, they
offer a promise of producing more efficient resource allocations, compared to
traditional system-centric approaches that do not allow consumers and providers
to express their valuations for computational resources. In this paper, we
investigate the pricing of resources in grids through the use of a
computational commodity market of CPU resources, where resource prices are
determined through the computation of a supply-and-demand equilibrium. In
particular, we introduce several categories of CPUs characterized by their
execution speed. These differ in cost and performance but may be used
interchangeably in executing jobs and thus represent so-called substitutable
resources. We investigate the performance of the algorithms for computing the
supply-and-demand equilibrium in this multi-commodity setting under dynamically
varying consumer and provider populations.
