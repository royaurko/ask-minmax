Project Management process plays a critical role in managing factors such as
cost, time, technology and personnel towards achieving the success of a project
and henceforth the sustainability of the company in the industrial market. This
paper emphasizes empirical study of several projects developed over a period of
time in a product and service based CMMI Level 5 Software Company. The
investigation shows impact analysis of resources such as cost, time, and number
of developers towards the successful completion of the project as allocated by
the project manager during the developmental process. The analysis has further
led to the introduction of a new qualitative metric, Success Level Index Metric
(SLI) whose index value varies from 0 to 1. SLI acts as a maturity indicator
that indicates the degree of maturity of the company in terms of success of
their projects based on which the company can choose their desired level of
success for their projects.
