Marine microorganisms often reach high swimming speeds, either to take
advantage of evanescent nutrient patches or to beat Brownian forces. Since this
implies that a sizable part of their energetic budget must be allocated to
motion, it is reasonable to assume that some fast-swimming microorganisms may
increase their nutrient intake by increasing their speed v. We formulate a
model to investigate this hypothesis and its consequences, finding the steady
state solutions and analyzing their stability. Surprisingly, we find that even
modest increases in nutrient absorption may lead to a significant increase of
the microbial speed. In fact, evaluations obtained using realistic parameter
values for bacteria indicate that the speed increase due to the enhanced
nutrient absorption may be quite large.
