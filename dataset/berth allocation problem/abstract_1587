Sponsored search adopts generalized second price (GSP) auction mechanism
which works on the concept of pay per click which is most commonly used for the
allocation of slots in the searched page. Two main aspects associated with GSP
are the bidding amount and the click through rate (CTR). The CTR learning
algorithms currently being used works on the basic principle of (#clicks_i/
#impressions_i) under a fixed window of clicks or impressions or time. CTR are
prone to fraudulent clicks, resulting in sudden increase of CTR. The current
algorithms are unable to find the solutions to stop this, although with the use
of machine learning algorithms it can be detected that fraudulent clicks are
being generated. In our paper, we have used the concept of relative ranking
which works on the basic principle of (#clicks_i /#clicks_t). In this
algorithm, both the numerator and the denominator are linked. As #clicks_t is
higher than previous algorithms and is linked to the #clicks_i, the small
change in the clicks which occurs in the normal scenario have a very small
change in the result but in case of fraudulent clicks the number of clicks
increases or decreases rapidly which will add up with the normal clicks to
increase the denominator, thereby decreasing the CTR.
