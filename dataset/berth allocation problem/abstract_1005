Even though virtualization provides a lot of advantages in cloud computing,
it does not provide effective performance isolation between the virtualization
machines. In other words, the performance may get affected due the
interferences caused by co-virtual machines. This can be achieved by the proper
management of resource allocations between the Virtual Machines running
simultaneously. This paper aims at providing a proposed novel architecture that
is based on Fast Genetic K-means++ algorithm and test results show positive
improvements in terms of performance improvements over a similar existing
approach.
