For a {\em simple Euclidean Jordan algebra}, let $\mathfrak{co}$ be its
conformal algebra, $\mathscr P$ be the manifold consisting of its semi-positive
rank-one elements, $C^\infty(\mathscr P)$ be the space of complex-valued smooth
functions on $\mathscr P$. An explicit action of $\mathfrak{co}$ on
$C^\infty(\mathscr P)$, referred to as the {\em hidden action} of
$\mathfrak{co}$ on $\mathscr P$, is exhibited. This hidden action turns out to
be mathematically responsible for the existence of the Kepler problem and its
recently-discovered vast generalizations, referred to as $J$-Kepler problems.
The $J$-Kepler problems are then reconstructed and re-examined in terms of the
unified language of Euclidean Jordan algebras. As a result, for a simple
Euclidean Jordan algebra, the minimal representation of its conformal group can
be realized either as the Hilbert space of bound states for its $J$-Kepler
problem or as $L^2({\mathscr P}, {1\over r}\mathrm{vol})$, where $\mathrm{vol}$
is the volume form on $\mathscr P$ and $r$ is the inner product of $x\in
\mathscr P$ with the identity element of the Jordan algebra.
