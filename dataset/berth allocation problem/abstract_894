Ethernet-based Passive optical network (E-PON) is the key for next generation
access networks. It must have the property of high efficiency, low cost, and
support quality of service (QoS). We present a novel media access control (MAC)
protocol that maximizes network efficiency by using dynamic bandwidth
allocation (DBA) algorithm suitable for E-PON. This protocol minimizes packet
delay and delay variation for high priority traffic to ensure QoS. Simulation
results show excellent network throughput. Simulation results also show low
packet delay and packet delay variation for high priority traffic compare with
traditional MAC protocol of E-PON. When the network performs ranging, this
protocol ensures zero interruption of high priority traffic, such as audio or
video applications.
