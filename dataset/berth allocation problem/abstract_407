Spectrum sensing is one of the key topics towards the implementation of
future wireless services like SuperWiFi. This new wireless proposal aims at
using the freed spectrum resulting from the analog-to-digital transition of TV
channels for wireless data transmission (UHF TV White Spaces). The benefits
range from better building penetration to longer distances when compared to the
set of IEEE 802.11 standards. Nevertheless, the effective use of the available
spectrum is subject to strict regulation that prohibits unlicensed users to
interfere with incumbents (like wireless microphones). Cognitive Radios (CR)
and dynamic spectrum allocation are suggested to cope with this problem. These
techniques consist on frequency sweeps of the TV-UHF band to detect White
Spaces that could be used for SuperWiFi transmissions. In this paper we develop
and implement algorithms from GNURadio in the Ettus USRP-E110 to build a
standalone White Spaces detector that can be consulted from a centralized
location via IP networks.
