A new binary (bit-level) lossless compression catalyst method based on a
modular arithmetic, called Binary Allocation via Modular Arithmetic (BAMA), has
been introduced in this paper. In other words, BAMA is for storage and
transmission of binary sequences, digital signal, images and video, also
streaming and all kinds of digital transmission. As we said, our method does
not compress, but facilitates the action of the real compressor, in our case,
any lossless compression algorithm (Run Length Encoding, Lempel-Ziv-Welch,
Huffman, Arithmetic, etc), that is, it acts as a compression catalyst. Finally,
this catalyst allows a significant increase in the compression performance of
binary sequences, among others.
