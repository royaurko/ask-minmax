We formulate the resource allocation problem for the uplink of code division
multiple access (CDMA) networks using a game theoretic framework, propose an
efficient and distributed algorithm for a joint rate and power allocation, and
show that the proposed algorithm converges to the unique Nash equilibrium (NE)
of the game. Our choice for the utility function enables each user to adapt its
transmit power and throughput to its channel. Due to users' selfish behavior,
the output of the game (its NE) may not be a desirable one. To avoid such
cases, we use pricing to control each user's behavior, and analytically show
that similar to the no-pricing case, our pricing-based algorithm converges to
the unique NE of the game, at which, each user achieves its target
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). We also extend our distributed
resource allocation scheme to multi-cell environments for base station
assignment. Simulation results confirm that our algorithm is computationally
efficient and its signalling overhead is low. In particular, we will show that
in addition to its ability to attain the required QoS of users, our scheme
achieves better fairness in allocating resources and can significantly reduce
transmit power as compared to existing schemes.
