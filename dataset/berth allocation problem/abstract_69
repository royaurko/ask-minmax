This paper considers non-cooperative and fully-distributed power-allocation
for selfish transmitter-receiver pairs in shared unlicensed spectrum when
normalized-interference to each receiver is uncertain. We model each uncertain
parameter by the sum of its nominal (estimated) value and a bounded additive
error in a convex set, and show that the allocated power always converges to
its equilibrium, called robust Nash equilibrium (RNE). In the case of a bounded
and symmetric uncertainty region, we show that the power allocation problem for
each user is simplified, and can be solved in a distributed manner. We derive
the conditions for RNE's uniqueness and for convergence of the distributed
algorithm; and show that the total throughput (social utility) is less than
that at NE when RNE is unique. We also show that for multiple RNEs, the social
utility may be higher at a RNE as compared to that at the corresponding NE, and
demonstrate that this is caused by users' orthogonal utilization of bandwidth
at RNE. Simulations confirm our analysis.
