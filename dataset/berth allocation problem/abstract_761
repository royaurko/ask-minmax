In this paper, we address the aggregation of dependent stop loss reinsurance
risks where the dependence among the ceding insurer(s) risks is governed by the
Sarmanov distribution and each individual risk belongs to the class of Erlang
mixtures. We investigate the e?ects of the ceding insurer(s) risk dependencies
on the reinsurer risk profile by deriving a closed formula for the distribution
function of the aggregated stop loss reinsurance risk. Furthermore,
diversification e?ects from aggregating reinsurance risks are examined by
deriving a closed expression for the risk capital needed for the whole
portfolio of the reinsurer and also the allocated risk capital for each
business unit under the TVaR capital allocation principle. Moreover, given the
risk capital that the reinsurer holds, we express the default probability of
the reinsurer analytically. In case the reinsurer is in default, we determine
analytical expressions for the amount of the aggregate reinsured unpaid losses
and the unpaid losses of each reinsured line of business of the ceding
insurer(s). These results are illustrated by numerical examples.
