In this paper, we investigate the use of a cross-layer allocation mechanism
for the high-rate ultra-wideband (UWB) systems. The aim of this paper is
twofold. First, through the cross-layer approach that provides a new service
differentiation approach to the fully distributed UWB systems, we support
traffic with quality of service (QoS) guarantee in a multi-user context.
Second, we exploit the effective SINR method that represents the
characteristics of multiple sub-carrier SINRs in the multi-band WiMedia
solution proposed for UWB systems, in order to provide the channel state
information needed for the multi-user sub-band allocation. This new approach
improves the system performance and optimizes the spectrum utilization with a
low cost data exchange between the different users while guaranteeing the
required QoS. In addition, this new approach solves the problem of the
cohabitation of more than three users in the same WiMedia channel.
