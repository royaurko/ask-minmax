The Method a Raman of spectroscopy studies allocation of molecules in ternary
mix-crystals of a p-dibromobenzene of p-dichlorobenzene and
p-bromochlorobenzene. It is shown, that the mutual concentration of builders
depends on requirements of growing. Was possibly as a uniform modification of
concentration of all builders along a specimen, and a wavy modification of
concentration of two substances.
