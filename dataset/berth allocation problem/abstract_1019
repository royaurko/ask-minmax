It is very challenging part to keep safely all required data that are needed
in many applications for user in cloud. Storing our data in cloud may not be
fully trustworthy. Since client doesn't have copy of all stored data, he has to
depend on Cloud Service Provider. But dynamic data operations, Read-Solomon and
verification token construction methods don't tell us about total storage
capacity of server allocated space before and after the data addition in cloud.
So we have to introduce a new proposed system of efficient storage measurement
and space comparison algorithm with time management for measuring the total
allocated storage area before and after the data insertion in cloud. So by
using our proposed scheme, the value or weight of stored data before and after
is measured by client with specified time in cloud storage area with accuracy.
And here we also have proposed the multi-server restore point in server failure
condition. If there occurs any server failure, by using this scheme the data
can be recovered automatically in cloud server. Our proposed scheme efficiently
checks space for the in-outsourced data to maintain integrity. Here the TPA
necessarily doesn't have the delegation to audit user's data.
