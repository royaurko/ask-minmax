The proliferation of massive datasets combined with the development of
sophisticated analytical techniques have enabled a wide variety of novel
applications such as improved product recommendations, automatic image tagging,
and improved speech-driven interfaces. These and many other applications can be
supported by Predictive Analytic Queries (PAQs). A major obstacle to supporting
PAQs is the challenging and expensive process of identifying and training an
appropriate predictive model. Recent efforts aiming to automate this process
have focused on single node implementations and have assumed that model
training itself is a black box, thus limiting the effectiveness of such
approaches on large-scale problems. In this work, we build upon these recent
efforts and propose an integrated PAQ planning architecture that combines
advanced model search techniques, bandit resource allocation via runtime
algorithm introspection, and physical optimization via batching. The result is
TuPAQ, a component of the MLbase system, which solves the PAQ planning problem
with comparable quality to exhaustive strategies but an order of magnitude more
efficiently than the standard baseline approach, and can scale to models
trained on terabytes of data across hundreds of machines.
