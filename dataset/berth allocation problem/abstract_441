Analyzing simple and natural price-adjustment processes that converge to a
market equilibrium is a fundamental question in economics. Such an analysis may
have implications in economic theory, computational economics, and distributed
systems. T\^atonnement, proposed by Walras in 1874, is a process by which
prices go up in response to excess demand, and down in response to excess
supply. This paper analyzes the convergence of a time-discrete t\^atonnement
process, a problem that recently attracted considerable attention of computer
scientists. We prove that the simple t\^atonnement process that we consider
converges (efficiently) to equilibrium prices and allocation in markets with
nested CES-Leontief utilities, generalizing some of the previous convergence
proofs for more restricted types of utility functions.
