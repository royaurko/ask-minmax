In cost sharing games, the existence and efficiency of pure Nash equilibria
fundamentally depends on the method that is used to share the resources' costs.
We consider a general class of resource allocation problems in which a set of
resources is used by a heterogeneous set of selfish users. The cost of a
resource is a (non-decreasing) function of the set of its users. Under the
assumption that the costs of the resources are shared by uniform cost sharing
protocols, i.e., protocols that use only local information of the resource's
cost structure and its users to determine the cost shares, we exactly quantify
the inefficiency of the resulting pure Nash equilibria. Specifically, we show
tight bounds on prices of stability and anarchy for games with only submodular
and only supermodular cost functions, respectively, and an asymptotically tight
bound for games with arbitrary set-functions. While all our upper bounds are
attained for the well-known Shapley cost sharing protocol, our lower bounds
hold for arbitrary uniform cost sharing protocols and are even valid for games
with anonymous costs, i.e., games in which the cost of each resource only
depends on the cardinality of the set of its users.
