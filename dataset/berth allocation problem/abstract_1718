A Boolean constraint satisfaction instance is a conjunction of constraint
applications, where the allowed constraints are drawn from a fixed set B of
Boolean functions. We consider the problem of determining whether two given
constraint satisfaction instances are equivalent and prove a Dichotomy Theorem
by showing that for all sets C of allowed constraints, this problem is either
polynomial-time solvable or coNP-complete, and we give a simple criterion to
determine which case holds.
  A more general problem addressed in this paper is the isomorphism problem,
the problem of determining whether there exists a renaming of the variables
that makes two given constraint satisfaction instances equivalent in the above
sense. We prove that this problem is coNP-hard if the corresponding equivalence
problem is coNP-hard, and polynomial-time many-one reducible to the graph
isomorphism problem in all other cases.
