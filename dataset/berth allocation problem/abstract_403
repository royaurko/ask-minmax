We propose a new method for opportunistic power control in multi-carrier
interference channels for delay-tolerant data services. In doing so, we utilize
a game theoretic framework with novel constraints, where each user tries to
maximize its utility in a distributed and opportunistic manner, while
satisfying the game's constraints by adapting its transmit power to its
channel. In this scheme, users transmit with more power on good sub-channels
and do the opposite on bad sub-channels. In this way, in addition to the
allocated power on each sub-channel, the total power of all users also depends
on channel conditions. Since each user's power level depends on power levels of
other users, the game belongs to the \emph{generalized} Nash equilibrium (GNE)
problems, which in general, is hard to analyze. We show that the proposed game
has a GNE, and derive the sufficient conditions for its uniqueness. Besides, we
propose a new pricing scheme for maximizing each user's throughput in an
opportunistic manner under its total power constraint; and provide the
sufficient conditions for the algorithm's convergence and its GNE's uniqueness.
Simulations confirm that our proposed scheme yields a higher throughput for
each user and/or has a significantly improved efficiency as compared to other
existing opportunistic methods.
