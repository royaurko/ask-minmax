The existence and uniqueness in fractional Sobolev spaces of the Cauchy
problem to a stochastic parabolic integro-differential equation is
investigated. A model problem with coefficients independent of space variable
is considered. The equation arises, for example, in a filtering problem with a
jump signal and jump observation process.
