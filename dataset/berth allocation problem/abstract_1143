In this work, we analyze the performance of a signature quantization scheme
for reverse-link Direct Sequence (DS)- Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).
Assuming perfect estimates of the channel and interference covariance, the
receiver selects the signature that minimizes interference power or maximizes
signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for a desired user from a
signature codebook. The codebook index corresponding to the optimal signature
is then relayed to the user with a finite number of bits via a feedback
channel. Here we are interested in the performance of a Random Vector
Quantization (RVQ) codebook, which contains independent isotropically
distributed vectors. Assuming arbitrary transmit power allocation, we consider
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel first with no fading and
subsequently, with multipath fading. We derive the corresponding SINR in a
large system limit at the output of matched filter and linear minimum mean
squared error (MMSE) receiver. Numerical examples show that the derived large
system results give a good approximation to the performance of finite-size
system and that the MMSE receiver achieves close to a single-user performance
with only one feedback bit per signature element.
