We give a representation for labeled ordered trees that supports labeled
queries such as finding the i-th ancestor of a node with a given label. Our
representation is succinct, namely the redundancy is small-o of the optimal
space for storing the tree. This improves the representation of He et al. which
is succinct unless the entropy of the labels is small.
