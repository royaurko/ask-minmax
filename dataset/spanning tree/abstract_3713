The two Higgs doublet model has a rich vacuum structure, including the
possibility of existence of two Standard Model-like minima at tree-level. It is
therefore possible that the universe's vacuum is metastable, and a deeper
minimum exists. We present the analytical conditions one must demand of the
potential's parameters to prevent that possibility, and analyse what the
current LHC data tells us about the eventual existence of that second minimum.
