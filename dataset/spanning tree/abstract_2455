In the scenario with degenerate neutrino masses at tree-level, we show how
threshold corrections with either non-trivial or trivial mixing at tree-level
have the power to generate the observed deviations from a degenerate spectrum.
Moreover, it is possible to also generate the mixing fully radiatively when
there is trivial mixing at tree-level.
  We give a brief overview over the topic and discuss the outcome of threshold
corrections for degenerate neutrino masses in a supersymmetric model. A
detailed description can be found in [arXiv:1412.4585].
