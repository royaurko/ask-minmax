Assuming the existence of right-handed neutrinos, we consider an electroweak
model based on the gauge symmetry $SU(4)_L\otimes U(1)_N$. We study the neutral
currents coupled to all neutral vector bosons present in the theory. There are
no flavor changing neutral currents at tree level, coupled with the lightest
neutral vector boson.
