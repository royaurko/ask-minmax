The eccentric connectivity index $\xi^c$ is a distance--based molecular
structure descriptor that was recently used for mathematical modeling of
biological activities of diverse nature. We prove that the broom has maximum
$\xi^c$ among trees with a fixed maximum vertex degree, and characterize such
trees with minimum $\xi^c$\,. In addition, we propose a simple linear algorithm
for calculating $\xi^c$ of trees.
