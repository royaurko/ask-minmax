Phylogenetic diversity is a measure for describing how much of an
evolutionary tree is spanned by a subset of species. If one applies this to the
(unknown) subset of current species that will still be present at some future
time, then this `future phylogenetic diversity' provides a measure of the
impact of various extinction scenarios in biodiversity conservation. In this
paper we study the distribution of future phylogenetic diversity under a simple
model of extinction (a generalized `field of bullets' model). We show that the
distribution of future phylogenetic diversity converges to a normal
distribution as the number of species grows (under mild conditions, which are
necessary). We also describe an algorithm to compute the distribution
efficiently, provided the edge lengths are integral, and briefly outline the
significance of our findings for biodiversity conservation.
