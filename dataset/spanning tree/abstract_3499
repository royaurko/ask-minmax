We introduce a transformation of finite integer sequences, show that every
sequence eventually stabilizes under this transformation and that the number of
fixed points is counted by the Catalan numbers. The sequences that are fixed
are precisely those that describe themselves -- every term $t$ is equal to the
number of previous terms that are smaller than $t$. In addition, we provide an
easy way to enumerate all these self-describing sequences by organizing them in
a Catalan tree with a specific labelling system.
