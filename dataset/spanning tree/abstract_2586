We construct a natural discrete random field on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $d\geq 5$
that converges weakly to the bi-Laplacian Gaussian field in the scaling limit.
The construction is based on assigning i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables on
each component of the uniform spanning forest, thus defines an associated
random function. To our knowledge, this is the first natural discrete model
(besides the discrete bi-Laplacian Gaussian field) that converges to the
bi-Laplacian Gaussian field.
