We analyze the tree-level 2->2 scattering of massive spin-2 bosons in a
theory with only relevant and marginal operators and extract the sum rules on
the coupling constants and masses required to achieve tree-level unitarity to
very high energy. We do this for four illustrative cases. In the first, we
include massive spin-1 and spin-0 bosons in our theory, but do not require
gauge invariance. For this case, we find that it is, in fact, possible to
construct a theory where all 2->2 scattering processes are tree-level unitary
to very high energy. In the second case, we consider a theory that only
includes massive spin-2 and spin-0 bosons. In the absence of spin-1 bosons, we
find that it is impossible to unitarize the spin-2 scattering. In the third and
fourth cases, we reintroduce the spin-1 bosons as gauge bosons and demand that
all interactions are gauge invariant. We take the spin-2 bosons to transform
under the adjoint representation of one or two gauge groups. For both of these
cases, we find that unitarization is unachievable.
