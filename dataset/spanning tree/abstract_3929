We introduce the C++ application and R package ranger. The software is a fast
implementation of random forests for high dimensional data. Ensembles of
classification, regression and survival trees are supported. We describe the
implementation, provide examples, validate the package with a reference
implementation, and compare runtime and memory usage with other
implementations. The new software proves to scale best with the number of
features, samples, trees, and features tried for splitting. Finally, we show
that ranger is the fastest and most memory efficient implementation of random
forests to analyze data on the scale of a genome-wide association study.
