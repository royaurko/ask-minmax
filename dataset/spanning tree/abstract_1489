We study the detection performance of $M$-ary relay trees, where only the
leaves of the tree represent sensors making measurements. The root of the tree
represents the fusion center which makes an overall detection decision. Each of
the other nodes is a relay node which aggregates $M$ messages sent by its child
nodes into a new compressed message and sends the message to its parent node.
Building on previous work on the detection performance of $M$-ary relay trees
with binary messages, in this paper we study the case of non-binary relay
message alphabets. We characterize the exponent of the error probability with
respect to the message alphabet size $\mathcal D$, showing how the detection
performance increases with $\mathcal D$. Our method involves reducing a tree
with non-binary relay messages into an equivalent higher-degree tree with only
binary messages.
