We give an expression for the solution to propagator-type Dyson-Schwinger
equations with one primitive at 1 loop as an expansion over rooted connected
chord diagrams. Along the way we give a refinement of a classical recurrence of
rooted connected chord diagrams, and a representation in terms of binary trees.
