Let $G$ be a graph and let $A(G)$ be the adjacency matrix of $G$. The
signature $s(G)$ of $G$ is the difference between the positive inertia index
and the negative inertia index of $A(G)$. Ma et al. [Positive and negative
inertia index of a graph, Linear Algebra and its Applications 438(2013)331-341]
conjectured that $-c_3(G)\leq s(G)\leq c_5(G),$ where $c_3(G)$ and $c_5(G)$
respectively denote the number of cycles in $G$ which have length $4k+3$ and
$4k+5$ for some integers $k \ge 0$, and proved the conjecture holds for trees,
unicyclic or bicyclic graphs.
  It is known that $s(G)=0$ if $G$ is bipartite, and the signature is closely
related to the odd cycles or nonbipartiteness of a graph from the existed
results. In this paper we show that the conjecture holds for the line graph and
power trees.
