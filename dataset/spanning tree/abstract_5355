A (3,4)-biregular bigraph G is a bipartite graph where all vertices in one
part have degree 3 and all vertices in the other part have degree 4. A path
factor of G is a spanning subgraph whose components are nontrivial paths. We
prove that a simple (3,4)-biregular bigraph always has a path factor such that
the endpoints of each path have degree three. Moreover we suggest a polynomial
algorithm for the construction of such a path factor.
