We study relations between multizeta values for function fields introduced by
D. Thakur. The F_p-span of Thakur's multizeta values is an algebra (Thakur.
Shuffle relations for function field multizeta values). In particular, the
product \zeta(a)\zeta(b) is a linear combination of multizeta values. In this
paper, several of the conjectures formulated by the contributor and by D. Thakur for
small values or for special families of a about how to write \zeta(a)\zeta(b)
as an F_p-linear combination of multizeta values, are proved. Also, the parity
conjecture formulated by Thakur is proved.
