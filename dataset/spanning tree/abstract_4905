We consider a branching population where individuals have i.i.d.\ life
lengths (not necessarily exponential) and constant birth rate. We let $N_t$
denote the population size at time $t$. %(called homogeneous, binary
Crump--Mode--Jagers process). We further assume that all individuals, at birth
time, are equipped with independent exponential clocks with parameter $\delta$.
We are interested in the genealogical tree stopped at the first time $T$ when
one of those clocks rings. This question has applications in epidemiology, in
population genetics, in ecology and in queuing theory.
  We show that conditional on $\{T<\infty\}$, the joint law of $(N_T, T,
X^{(T)})$, where $X^{(T)}$ is the jumping contour process of the tree truncated
at time $T$, is equal to that of $(M, -I_M, Y_M')$ conditional on
$\{M\not=0\}$, where : $M+1$ is the number of visits of 0, before some single
independent exponential clock $\mathbf{e}$ with parameter $\delta$ rings, by
some specified L{\'e}vy process $Y$ without negative jumps reflected below its
supremum; $I_M$ is the infimum of the path $Y_M$ defined as $Y$ killed at its
last 0 before $\mathbf{e}$; $Y_M'$ is the Vervaat transform of $Y_M$.
  This identity yields an explanation for the geometric distribution of $N_T$
\cite{K,T} and has numerous other applications. In particular, conditional on
$\{N_T=n\}$, and also on $\{N_T=n, T<a\}$, the ages and residual lifetimes of
the $n$ alive individuals at time $T$ are i.i.d.\ and independent of $n$. We
provide explicit formulae for this distribution and give a more general
application to outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the hospital.
