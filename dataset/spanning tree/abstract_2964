Following Laczkovich we consider the partially ordered set $\iB_1(\RR)$ of
Baire class 1 functions endowed with the pointwise order, and investigate the
order types of the linearly ordered subsets. Answering a question of Komj\'ath
and Kunen we show (in $ZFC$) that special Aronszajn lines are embeddable into
$\iB_1(\RR)$. We also show that under Martin's Axiom a linearly ordered set
$\mathbb{L}$ with $|\mathbb{L}|<2^\omega$ is embeddable into $\iB_1(\RR)$ iff
$\mathbb{L}$ does not contain a copy of $\omega_1$ or $\omega_1^*$. We present
a $ZFC$-example of a linear order of size $2^\omega$ showing that this
characterisation is not valid for orders of size continuum.
  These results are obtained using the notion of a compact-special tree; that
is, a tree that is embeddable into the class of compact subsets of the reals
partially ordered under reverse inclusion. We investigate how this notion is
related to the well-known notion of an $\RR$-special tree and also to some
other notions of specialness.
