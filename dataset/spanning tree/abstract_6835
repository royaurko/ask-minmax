We consider the call-by-value lambda-calculus extended with a may-convergent
non-deterministic choice and a must-convergent parallel composition. Inspired
by recent works on the relational semantics of linear logic and non-idempotent
intersection types, we endow this calculus with a type system based on the
so-called Girard's second translation of intuitionistic logic into linear
logic. We prove that a term is typable if and only if it is converging, and
that its typing tree carries enough information to give a bound on the length
of its lazy call-by-value reduction. Moreover, when the typing tree is minimal,
such a bound becomes the exact length of the reduction.
