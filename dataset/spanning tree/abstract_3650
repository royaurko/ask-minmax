By studying its subgraphs, it is argued that the lower critical percolation
threshold of the enhanced binary tree (EBT) is bounded as $p_{c1} < 0.355059$,
while the upper threshold is bounded both from above and below by 1/2 according
to renormalization-group arguments. We also review a correlation analysis in an
earlier work, which claimed a significantly higher estimate of $p_{c2}$ than
1/2, to show that this analysis in fact gives a consistent result with this
bound. Our result confirms that the duality relation between critical
thresholds does not hold exactly for the EBT and its dual, possibly due to the
lack of transitivity.
