CVT and XOR are two binary operations together used to calculate the sum of
two non-negative integers on using a recursive mechanism. In this present study
the convergence behaviors of this recursive mechanism has been captured through
a tree like structure named as CVT-XOR Tree. We have analyzed how to identify
the parent nodes, leaf nodes and internal nodes in the CVT-XOR Tree. We also
provide the parent information, depth information and the number of children of
a node in different CVT-XOR Trees on defining three different matrices. Lastly,
one observation is made towards very old Mathematical problem of Goldbach
Conjecture.
