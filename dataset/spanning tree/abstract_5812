We describe the versal deformation of two-dimensional cyclic quotient
singularities in terms of equations, following Arndt, Brohme and Hamm. For the
reduced components the equations are determined by certain systems of dots in a
triangle. The equations of the versal deformation itself are governed by a
different combinatorial structure, involving rooted trees.
