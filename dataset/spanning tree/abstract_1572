The tree amplitudes in scalar field theories are presented at all $n$. The
momentum routing of propagators is given at $n$-point in terms of a specified
set of numbers, and the mass expansion of the massive theories is generated. A
group structure on the diagrams is given. The tree amplitudes can be used to
find the effective action.
