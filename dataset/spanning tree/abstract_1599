This paper deals with the so-called Stanley conjecture, which asks whether
they are non-isomorphic trees with the same symmetric function generalization
of the chromatic polynomial. By establishing a correspondence between
caterpillars trees and integer compositions, we prove that caterpillars in a
large class (we call trees in this class proper) have the same symmetric
chromatic function generalization of the chromatic polynomial if and only if
they are isomorphic.
