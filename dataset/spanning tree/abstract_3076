We argue that no notion of flavour is necessary when performing amplitude
calculations in perturbative QCD with massless quarks. We show this explicitly
at tree-level, using a flavour recursion relation to obtain multi-flavoured QCD
from one-flavour QCD. The method relies on performing a colour decomposition,
under which the one-flavour primitive amplitudes have a structure which is
restricted by planarity and cyclic ordering. An understanding of SU(3)_c group
theory relations between QCD primitive amplitudes and their organisation around
the concept of a Dyck tree is also necessary. The one-flavour primitive
amplitudes are effectively N=1 supersymmetric, and a simple consequence is that
all of tree-level massless QCD can be obtained from Drummond and Henn's closed
form solution to tree-level N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.
