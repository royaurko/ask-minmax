We consider the mean value properties for finite variation measures with
respect to a Markov operator in a discrete environnement. We prove equivalent
conditions for the weak mean value property in the case of general Markov
operators and for the strong mean value property in the case of transient
Markov operators adapted to a tree structure. In this last case, conditions for
the equivalence between weak and strong mean value properties are given.
