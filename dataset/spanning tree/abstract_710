The Theil index is much used in economy and finance; it looks like the
Shannon entropy, but pertains to event values rather than to their
probabilities. Any time series can be remapped through the Theil index.
Correlation coefficients can be evaluated between the new time series, thereby
allowing to study their mutual statistical distance, - to be contrasted to the
usual correlation distance measure for the primary time series. As an example
this entropy-like correlation distance method (ECDM) is applied to the Gross
Domestic Product of 20 rich countries in order to test some economy
globalization process. Hierarchical distances allow to construct (i) a linear
network, (ii) a Locally Minimal Spanning Tree. The role of time averaging in
finite size windows is illustrated and discussed. It is also shown that the
mean distance between the most developed countries, was decreasing since 1960
till 2000, - which we consider to be a proof of globalization of the economy
for these countries.
