Konig's theorem states that the covering number and the matching number of a
bipartite graph are equal. We prove a generalisation of this result, in which
each point in one side of the graph is replaced by a subtree of a given tree.
The proof uses a recent extension of Hall's theorem to families of hypergraphs,
by the first contributor and P. Haxell.
