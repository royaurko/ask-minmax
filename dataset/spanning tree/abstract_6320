Consider the Klein-Gordon equation coupled with an interaction term
$(\Box+m^2)\phi+\lambda\psi^p$. For the linear Klein-Gordon equation, a kind of
generalized Noether's theorem gives us a conserved quantity. The purpose of
this paper is to find an analogue of this conserved quantity in the interacting
case. We see that it can be done perturbatively, and we define explicitely a
conserved quantity using a perturbative expansion based on Planar Binary Tree
and a kind of Feynman rules. Only the case $p=2$ is treated but our approach
can be generalized to any $\phi^p$-theory.
