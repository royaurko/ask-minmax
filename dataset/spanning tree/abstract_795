This work explores the edge agreement problem of the second-order nonlinear
multi-agent system under quantized measurements. To begin with, the general
concepts of weighted edge Laplacian of directed graph are proposed and its
algebraic properties are further explored. Based on the essential edge
Laplacian, we derive a model reduction representation of the closed-loop
multi-agent system based on the spanning tree subgraph. Meanwhile, the edge
agreement problem of second-order nonlinear multi-agent system under quantized
effects is studied, in which both uniform and logarithmic quantizers are
considered. Particularly, for the uniform quantizers, we provide the upper
bound of the radius of the agreement neighborhood, which indicates that the
radius increases with the quantization interval. While for the logarithmic
quantizers, the agents converge exponentially to the desired agreement
equilibrium. Additionally, we also provide the estimates of the convergence
rate as well as indicate that the coarser the quantizer is, the slower the
convergence speed. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the
theoretical analysis.
