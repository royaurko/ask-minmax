We propose a new scheme in which supersymmetry breaking is communicated to
the MSSM sfermions by GUT gauge interactions at the tree level. The (positive)
contribution of MSSM fields to $\text{Str}(\mathcal{M}^2)$ is automatically
compensated by a (negative) contribution from heavy fields. Sfermion masses are
flavour universal, thus solving the supersymmetric flavour problem. In the
simplest SO(10) embedding, the ratio of different sfermion masses is predicted
and differs from mSugra and other schemes, thus making this framework testable
at the LHC. Gaugino masses are generated at the loop level but enhanced by
model dependent factors.
