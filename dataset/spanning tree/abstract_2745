We show that many countable support iterations of proper forcings preserve
Souslin trees. We establish sufficient conditions in terms of games and we draw
connections to other preservation properties. We present a proof of
preservation properties in countable support interations in the so-called Case
A that does not need a division into forcings that add reals and those who do
not.
