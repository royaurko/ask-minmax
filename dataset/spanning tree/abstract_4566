We find simple saturated alcohols with the given number of carbon atoms and
the minimal normal boiling point. The boiling point is predicted with a
weighted sum of the generalized first Zagreb index, the second Zagreb index,
the Wiener index for vertex-weighted graphs, and a simple index caring for the
degree of a carbon atom being incident to the hydroxyl group. To find extremal
alcohol molecules we characterize chemical trees of order $n$, which minimize
the sum of the second Zagreb index and the generalized first Zagreb index, and
also build chemical trees, which minimize the Wiener index over all chemical
trees with given vertex weights.
