Measurements of the production of high transverse momentum direct photons by
a 515 GeV/c piminus beam and 530 and 800 GeV/c proton beams in interactions
with beryllium and hydrogen targets are presented. The data span the kinematic
ranges of 3.5 < p_T < 12 GeV/c in transverse momentum and 1.5 units in
rapidity. The inclusive direct-photon cross sections are compared with
next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations and expectations based on a
phenomenological parton-k_T model.
