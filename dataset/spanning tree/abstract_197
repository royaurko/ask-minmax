The relative importance of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors determining
the variety of geometric shapes exhibited by dendritic trees remains unclear.
This question was addressed by developing a model of the growth of dendritic
trees based on diffusion-limited aggregation process. The model reproduces
diverse neuronal shapes (i.e., granule cells, Purkinje cells, the basal and
apical dendrites of pyramidal cells, and the axonal trees of interneurons) by
changing only the size of the growth area, the time span of pruning, and the
spatial concentration of 'neurotrophic particles'. Moreover, the presented
model shows how competition between neurons can affect the shape of the
dendritic trees. The model reveals that the creation of complex (but
reproducible) dendrite-like trees does not require precise guidance or an
intrinsic plan of the dendrite geometry. Instead, basic environmental factors
and the simple rules of diffusive growth adequately account for the spatial
embedding of different types of dendrites observed in the cortex. An example
demonstrating the broad applicability of the algorithm to model diverse types
of tree structures is also presented. Key words: Diffusion-limited aggregation;
