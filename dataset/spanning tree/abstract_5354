The $k$-core of a graph is the largest subgraph of minimum degree at least
$k$. We show that for $k$ sufficiently large, the $(k + 2)$-core of a random
graph $\G(n,p)$ asymptotically almost surely has a spanning $k$-regular
subgraph. Thus the threshold for the appearance of a $k$-regular subgraph of a
random graph is at most the threshold for the $(k+2)$-core. In particular, this
pins down the point of appearance of a $k$-regular subgraph in $\G(n,p)$ to a
window for $p$ of width roughly $2/n$ for large $n$ and moderately large $k$.
