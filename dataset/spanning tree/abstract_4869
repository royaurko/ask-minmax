In various extensions of the Standard Model (SM) tree level non-leptonic
decays of hadrons receive contributions from new heavy gauge bosons and
scalars. Prominent examples are the right-handed W' bosons in left-right
symmetric models and charged Higgs (H^\pm) particles in models with extended
scalar sector like two Higgs doublet models and supersymmetric models. Even in
the case of decays with four different quark flavours involved, to which
penguin operators cannot contribute, twenty linearly independent operators,
instead of two in the SM, have to be considered. Anticipating the important
role of such decays at the LHCb, KEKB and Super-B in Rome and having in mind
future improved lattice computations, we complete the existing NLO QCD formulae
for these processes by calculating O(alpha_s) corrections to matching
conditions for the Wilson coefficients of all contributing operators in the
NDR-\bar{MS} scheme. This allows to reduce certain unphysical scale and
renormalization scheme dependences in the existing NLO calculations. Our
results can also be applied to models with tree-level heavy neutral gauge boson
and scalar exchanges in Delta F = 1 transitions and constitute an important
part of NLO analyses of those non-leptonic decays to which also penguin
operators contribute.
