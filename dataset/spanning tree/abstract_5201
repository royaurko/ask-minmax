The generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation is combined with the
Dashen-Weinstein sum rule to provide a constraint equation between the
g(KSigmaN) and g(KLambdaN) coupling constants. A comprehensive examination of
the published phenomenological and theoretical hyperon couplings has yielded a
much smaller set of values, spanning the intervals
0.80<=g(KSigmaN)/Sqrt(4Pi)<=2.72 and -3.90<=g(KLambdaN)/Sqrt(4Pi)<=-1.84,
consistent with this criteria. The SU(3) and Goldberger-Treiman hyperon
couplings satisfy the constraint along with predictions from a Taylor series
extrapolation using the same momentum variation as exhibited by g(PiNN).
