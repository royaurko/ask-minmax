We completely characterise the complexity in the decision tree model of
computing composite relations of the form h = g(f^1,...,f^n), where each
relation f^i is boolean-valued. Immediate corollaries include a direct sum
theorem for decision tree complexity and a tight characterisation of the
decision tree complexity of iterated boolean functions.
