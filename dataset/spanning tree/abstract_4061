The long awaited baryonic $B$ decay $\bar B{}^0\to p\bar p$ was recently
observed by LHCb with a branching fraction of order $10^{-8}$. All the earlier
model predictions are too large compared with experiment. In this work, we
point out that for a given tree operator $O_i$, the contribution from its
Fiertz transformed operator, an effect often missed in the literature, tends to
cancel the internal $W$-emission amplitude induced from $O_i$. The wave
function of low-lying baryons are symmetric in momenta and the quark flavor
with the same chirality, but antisymmetric in color indices. Using these
symmetry properties and the chiral structure of weak interactions, we find that
half of the Feynman diagrams responsible for internal $W$-emission cancel.
Since this feature holds in the charmless modes but not in the charmful ones,
we advocate that the partial cancellation accounts for the smallness of the
tree-dominated charmless two-body baryonic $B$ decays. This also explains why
most previous model calculations predicted too large rates as the above
consideration was not taken into account. Finally, we emphasize that, contrary
to the claim in the literature, the internal $W$-emission tree amplitude should
be proportional to the Wilson coefficient $c_1+c_2$ rather than $c_1-c_2$.
