We show that for proving the Stanley conjecture, it is sufficient to consider
a very special class of monomial ideals. These ideals (or rather their lcm
lattices) are in bijection with the simplicial spanning trees of skeletons of a
simplex.
  We apply this result to verify the Stanley conjecture for quotients of
monomial ideals with up to six generators. For seven generators we obtain a
partial result.
