For a density $f$ on ${\mathbb R}^d$, a {\it high-density cluster} is any
connected component of $\{x: f(x) \geq \lambda\}$, for some $\lambda > 0$. The
set of all high-density clusters forms a hierarchy called the {\it cluster
tree} of $f$. We present two procedures for estimating the cluster tree given
samples from $f$. The first is a robust variant of the single linkage algorithm
for hierarchical clustering. The second is based on the $k$-nearest neighbor
graph of the samples. We give finite-sample convergence rates for these
algorithms which also imply consistency, and we derive lower bounds on the
sample complexity of cluster tree estimation. Finally, we study a tree pruning
procedure that guarantees, under milder conditions than usual, to remove
clusters that are spurious while recovering those that are salient.
