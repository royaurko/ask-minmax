These notes hopefully provide an aid to the comprehension of the
Connes-Moscovici and Connes-Kreimer works, by isolating common mathematical
features of the Connes-Moscovici, rooted trees, and Feynman-graph Hopf algebras
(as a new special branch of the theory of Hopf algebras expected to become
important). We discuss in particular the dual Milnor-Moore situation.
