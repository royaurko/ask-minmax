We construct factors of type $\tn$ for $n\in\NN, n\geq 2$ from group actions
on homogeneous trees and their boundaries. Our result is a discrete analogue of
a result of R.J Spatzier, where the hyperfinite factor of type $\tone$ is
constructed from a group action on the boundary of the universal cover of a
manifold.
