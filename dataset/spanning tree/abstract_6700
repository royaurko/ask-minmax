This paper is concerned with algorithms for prediction of discrete sequences
over a finite alphabet, using variable order Markov models. The class of such
algorithms is large and in principle includes any lossless compression
algorithm. We focus on six prominent prediction algorithms, including Context
Tree Weighting (CTW), Prediction by Partial Match (PPM) and Probabilistic
Suffix Trees (PSTs). We discuss the properties of these algorithms and compare
their performance using real life sequences from three domains: proteins,
English text and music pieces. The comparison is made with respect to
prediction quality as measured by the average log-loss. We also compare
classification algorithms based on these predictors with respect to a number of
large protein classification tasks. Our results indicate that a "decomposed"
CTW (a variant of the CTW algorithm) and PPM outperform all other algorithms in
sequence prediction tasks. Somewhat surprisingly, a different algorithm, which
is a modification of the Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm, significantly
outperforms all algorithms on the protein classification problems.
