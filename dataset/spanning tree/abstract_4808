We consider a nearest-neighbor SOS model, spin values $0,1,..., m$, $m\geq
2$, on a Cayley tree of order $k$ . We mainly assume that $m=2$ and study
translation-invariant (TI) and `splitting' (S) Gibbs measures (GMs). For $m=2$,
in the anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) case, a symmetric TISGM is unique for all
temperatures. In the ferromagnetic (FM) case, for $m=2$, the number of
symmetric TISGMs varies with the temperature: here we identify a critical
inverse temperature, $\beta^1_{\rm{cr}}$ ($=T_{\rm{cr}}^{\rm{STISG}}$) $\in
(0,\infty)$ such that $\forall$ $0\leq \beta\leq\beta^1_{\rm{cr}}$, there
exists a unique symmetric TISGM $\mu^*$ and $\forall$ $\beta
>\beta^1_{\rm{cr}}$ there are exactly three symmetric TISGMs : $\mu^*_+$,
$\mu^*_{\rm m}$ and $\mu^*_-$ For $\beta>\beta^1_{\rm{cr}}$ we also construct a
continuum of distinct, symmertric SGMs which are non-TI. Our second result
gives complete description of the set of periodic Gibbs measures for the SOS
model on a Cayley tree. We show that (i) for an FM SOS model, for any normal
subgroup of finite index, each periodic SGM is in fact TI. Further, (ii) for an
AFM SOS model, for any normal subgroup of finite index, each periodic SGM is
either TI or has period two (i.e., is a chess-board SGM).
