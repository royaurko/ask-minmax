We propose some slight additions to O-O languages to implement the necessary
features for using Deductive Object Programming (DOP). This way of programming
based upon the manipulation of the Production Tree of the Objects of Interest,
result in making Persistent these Objects and in sensibly lowering the code
complexity.
