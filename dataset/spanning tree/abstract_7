This paper considers the conjecture by Gr\"unbaum that every planar
3-connected graph has a spanning tree $T$ such that both $T$ and its co-tree
have maximum degree at most 3. Here, the co-tree of $T$ is the spanning tree of
the dual obtained by taking the duals of the non-tree edges. While Gr\"unbaum's
conjecture remains open, we show that every planar 3-connected graph has a
spanning tree $T$ such that both $T$ and its co-tree have maximum degree at
most 5. It can be found in linear time.
