Water under tension, as can be found in several systems including tree
vessels, is metastable. Cavitation can spontaneously occur, nucleating a
bubble. We investigate the dynamics of spon- taneous or triggered cavitation
inside water filled microcavities of a hydrogel. Results show that a stable
bubble is created in only a microsecond timescale, after transient
oscillations. Then, a diffusion driven expansion leads to filling of the
cavity. Analysis reveals that the nucleation of a bubble releases a tension of
several tens of MPa, and a simple model captures the different time scales of
the expansion process.
