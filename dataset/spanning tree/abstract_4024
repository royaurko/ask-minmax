Extending Furstenberg's ergodic theoretic proof for Szemer\'edi's theorem on
arithmetic progressions, Furstenberg and Weiss (2003) proved the following
qualitative result. For every d and k, there exists an integer N such that no
matter how we color the vertices of a complete binary tree T_N of depth N with
k colors, we can find a monochromatic replica of T_d in T_N such that (1) all
vertices at the same level in T_d are mapped into vertices at the same level in
T_N; (2) if a vertex x of T_d is mapped into a vertex y in T_N, then the two
children of x are mapped into descendants of the the two children of y in T_N,
respectively; and 3 the levels occupied by this replica form an arithmetic
progression. This result and its density versions imply van der Waerden's and
Szemer\'edi's theorems, and laid the foundations of a new Ramsey theory for
trees.
  Using simple counting arguments and a randomized coloring algorithm called
random split, we prove the following related result. Let N=N(d,k) denote the
smallest positive integer such that no matter how we color the vertices of a
complete binary tree T_N of depth N with k colors, we can find a monochromatic
replica of T_d in T_N which satisfies properties (1) and (2) above. Then we
have N(d,k)=\Theta(dk\log k). We also prove a density version of this result,
which, combined with Szemer\'edi's theorem, provides a very short combinatorial
proof of a quantitative version of the Furstenberg-Weiss theorem.
