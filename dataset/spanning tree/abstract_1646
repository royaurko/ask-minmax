In this work, we present the uniform spectrum of singularities of random
stable trees with parameter $\gamma\in(1,2)$. This study of the pointwise
regularity of the local time extends several existing results discussing the
fractal properties of stable trees at fixed height. In addition, we investigate
and characterise the distribution of exceptionally large masses of the local
time which appear at random levels.
