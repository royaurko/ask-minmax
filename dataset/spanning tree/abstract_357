We define a class of bipartite graphs that correspond naturally with Ferrers
diagrams. We give expressions for the number of spanning trees, the number of
Hamiltonian paths when applicable, the chromatic polynomial, and the chromatic
symmetric function. We show that the linear coefficient of the chromatic
polynomial is given by the excedance set statistic.
