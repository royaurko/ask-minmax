We consider maps on orientable surfaces. A map is called \emph{unicellular}
if it has a single face. A \emph{covered map} is a map (of genus $g$) with a
marked unicellular spanning submap (which can have any genus in
$\{0,1,...,g\}$). Our main result is a bijection between covered maps with $n$
edges and genus $g$ and pairs made of a plane tree with $n$ edges and a
unicellular bipartite map of genus $g$ with $n+1$ edges. In the planar case,
covered maps are maps with a marked spanning tree and our bijection specializes
into a construction obtained by the first contributor in \cite{OB:boisees}. Covered
maps can also be seen as \emph{shuffles} of two unicellular maps (one
representing the unicellular submap, the other representing the dual
unicellular submap). Thus, our bijection gives a correspondence between
shuffles of unicellular maps, and pairs made of a plane tree and a unicellular
bipartite map. In terms of counting, this establishes the equivalence between a
formula due to Harer and Zagier for general unicellular maps, and a formula due
to Jackson for bipartite unicellular maps. We also show that the bijection of
Bouttier, Di Francesco and Guitter \cite{BDFG:mobiles} (which generalizes a
previous bijection by Schaeffer \cite{Schaeffer:these}) between bipartite maps
and so-called well-labelled mobiles can be obtained as a special case of our
bijection.
