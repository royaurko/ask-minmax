Existence of frame invariant, maximum, time interval $T$, length $L$, and
mass $M$ is postulated. In the de Sitter universe - (1) the life span of
universe, (2) the circumference of universe at the point of maximum expansion,
and (3) the mass of the universe - are candidates for $T$, $L$ and $M$
respectively. Impact of such invariant global parameters, on the definition of
local physical quantities, such as velocity is discussed.
