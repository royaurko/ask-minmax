We review the first measurements of the CKM angle gamma from LHCb. These
measurements have been performed with b-hadron decays dominated by b -> u and b
-> c tree-level amplitudes, from which gamma can be determined without
theoretical uncertainties. Precision is achieved by averaging results from B-
-> Dh- (h= K,pi) decays with D -> h+h-, D -> K+pi-, and D -> K+pi-pi+pi-, and D
-> K_S^0h+h-. Prospects for these and future measurements of gamma using
neutral b-hadron decays are briefly discussed.
