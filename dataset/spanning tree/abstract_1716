Galled trees, directed acyclic graphs that model evolutionary histories with
isolated hybridization events, have become very popular due to both their
biological significance and the existence of polynomial time algorithms for
their reconstruction. In this paper we establish to which extent several
distance measures for the comparison of evolutionary networks are metrics for
galled trees, and hence when they can be safely used to evaluate galled tree
reconstruction methods.
