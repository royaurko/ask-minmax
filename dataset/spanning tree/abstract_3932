We study the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor during thin
shell collapse for a massive, real, scalar field theory. At tree-level, we find
thermal, Hawking-type, behaviour for the energy flux. Using the
Schwinger-Keldysh technique, we calculate two-loop corrections to the
tree-level correlation functions and show that they exhibit secular growth,
suggesting the breakdown of the perturbation theory.
