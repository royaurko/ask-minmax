Factorial, cumulant and $H_q$-moments in dependence on their rank q for the
instanton-induced deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in the frameworks of QCD are
calculated and analysed. The obtained correlation moments behaviour has
specific form, which can be considered as a new criterion of the QCD-instantons
identification on experiment at HERA.
