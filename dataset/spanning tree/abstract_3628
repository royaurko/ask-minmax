We consider the relationship between renormalizability and unitarity at a
Lifshitz point in d dimensions. We test tree unitarity for theories containing
only scalars and fermions, and for pure gauge theory. In both cases, we find
the requirement of weighted power-counting renormalizability is equivalent to
that of tree unitarity.
