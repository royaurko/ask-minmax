We present here a new solution for the astronomical computation of the
orbital motion of the Earth spanning from 0 to -250 Myr. The main improvement
with respect to the previous numerical solution La2004 (Laskar et al. 2004) is
an improved adjustment of the parameters and initial conditions through a ?t
over 1 Myr to a special version of the high accurate numerical ephemeris
INPOP08 (Fienga et al. 2009). The precession equations have also been entirely
revised and are no longer averaged over the orbital motion of the Earth and
Moon. This new orbital solution is now valid over more than 50 Myr in the past
or in the future with proper phases of the eccentricity variations. Due to
chaotic behavior, the precision of the solution decreases rapidly beyond this
time span, and we discuss the behavior of various solutions beyond 50 Myr. For
paleoclimate calibrations, we provide several di?erent solutions that are all
compatible with the most precise planetary ephemeris. We have thus reached the
time where geological data are now required to discriminate among planetary
orbital solutions beyond 50 Myr.
