We characterize the generating function of bipartite planar maps counted
according to the degree distribution of their black and white vertices. This
result is applied to the solution of the hard particle and Ising models on
random planar lattices. We thus recover and extend some results previously
obtained by means of matrix integrals.
  Proofs are purely combinatorial and rely on the idea that planar maps are
conjugacy classes of trees. In particular, these trees explain why the
solutions of the Ising and hard particle models on maps of bounded degree are
always algebraic.
