Two distinct distribution functions $P_{sp}(m)$ and $P_{ns}(m)$ of the scaled
largest cluster sizes $m$ are obtained at the percolation threshold by
numerical simulations, depending on the condition whether the lattice is
actually spanned or not. With $R(p_c)$ the spanning probability, the total
distribution of the largest cluster is given by $P_{tot}(m) = R(p_c)P_{sp}(m) +
(1-R(p_c))P_{ns}(m)$. The three distributions apparently have similar forms in
three and four dimensions while in two dimensions, $P_{tot}(m)$ does not follow
a familiar form. By studying the first and second cumulants of the distribution
functions, the different behaviour of $P_{tot}(m)$ in different dimensions may
be quantified.
