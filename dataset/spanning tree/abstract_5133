The canonical basis for quantized universal enveloping algebras associated to
the finite--dimensional simple Lie algebras, was introduced by Lusztig. The
principal technique is the explicit construction (via the braid group action)
of a lattice over $\bz[q^{-1}]$.
  This allows the algebraic characterization of the canonical basis as a
certain bar-invariant basis of $\cl$. Here we present a similar algebraic
characterization of the affine canonical basis. Our construction is complicated
by the need to introduce basis elements to span the ``imaginary'' subalgebra
which is fixed by the affine braid group. Once the basis is found we construct
a PBW-type basis whose $\bz[q^{-1}]$-span reduces to a ``crystal'' basis at
$q=\infty,$ with the imaginary component given by the Schur functions.
