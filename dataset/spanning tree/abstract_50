This paper studies a higher dimensional generalization of Frieze's
$\zeta(3)$-limit theorem in the Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph process. Frieze's theorem
states that the expected weight of the minimum spanning tree converges to
$\zeta(3)$ as the number of vertices goes to infinity. In this paper, we study
the $d$-Linial-Meshulam process as a model for random simplicial complexes,
where $d=1$ corresponds to the Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph process. First, we define
spanning acycles as a higher dimensional analogue of spanning trees, and
connect its minimum weight to persistent homology. Then, our main result shows
that the expected weight of the minimum spanning acycle behaves in
$O(n^{d-1})$.
