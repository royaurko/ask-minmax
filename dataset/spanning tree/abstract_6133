We present a code allowing to evolve three-dimensional self-gravitating
collisionless systems with a large number of particles N >= 10^7. FLY (Fast
Level-based N-bodY code) is a fully parallel code based on a tree algorithm. It
adopts periodic boundary conditions implemented by means of the Ewald summation
technique. FLY is based on the one-side communication paradigm and was
originally developed on a CRAY T3E system using the SHMEM library and it was
ported on SGI ORIGIN 2000 and on IBM SP. FLY (http://www.ct.astro.it/fly/)
version 1.1 is an open source freely available code. FLY data output can be
analysed with AstroMD, an analysis and visualization tool specifically designed
to deal with the visualization and analysis of astrophysical data. AstroMD can
manage different physical quantities. It can find out structures without well
defined shape or symmetries, and perform quantitative calculations on selected
regions. AstroMD (http://www.cineca.it/astromd) is a freely available code.
