We describe a combinatorial approach for investigating properties of rational
numbers. The overall approach rests on structural bijections between rational
numbers and familiar combinatorial objects, namely rooted trees. We emphasize
that such mappings achieve much more than enumeration of rooted trees. We
discuss two related structural bijections. The first corresponds to a bijective
map between integers and rooted trees. The first bijection also suggests a new
algorithm for sifting primes. The second bijection extends the first one in
order to map rational numbers to a family of rooted trees. The second bijection
suggests a new combinatorial construction for generating reduced rational
numbers, thereby producing refinements of the output of the Wilf-Calkin[1]
Algorithm.
