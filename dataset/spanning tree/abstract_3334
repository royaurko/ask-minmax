In recent work, the contributor and others have studied compositional algebras of
Petri nets. Here we consider mathematical aspects of the pure linking algebras
that underly them. We characterise composition of nets without places as the
composition of spans over appropriate categories of relations, and study the
underlying algebraic structures.
