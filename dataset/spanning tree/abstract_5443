We present the diagrammatic technique for calculating the free energy of the
matrix eigenvalue model (the model with arbitrary power beta by the
Vandermonde) to all orders of 1/N expansion in the case where the limiting
eigenvalue distribution spans arbitrary (but fixed) number of disjoint
intervals (curves) and when logarithmic terms are present. This diagrammatic
technique is corrected and refined as compared to our first paper with B.Eynard
of year 2006.
