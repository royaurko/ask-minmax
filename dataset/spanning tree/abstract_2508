In this paper we investigate an extremal problem on binary phylogenetic
trees. Given two such trees $T_1$ and $T_2$, both with leaf-set ${1,2,...,n}$,
we are interested in the size of the largest subset $S \subseteq {1,2,...,n}$
of leaves in a common subtree of $T_1$ and $T_2$. We show that any two binary
phylogenetic trees have a common subtree on $\Omega(\sqrt{\log{n}})$ leaves,
thus improving on the previously known bound of $\Omega(\log\log n)$ due to M.
Steel and L. Szekely. To achieve this improved bound, we first consider two
special cases of the problem: when one of the trees is balanced or a
caterpillar, we show that the largest common subtree has $\Omega(\log n)$
leaves. We then handle the general case by proving and applying a Ramsey-type
result: that every binary tree contains either a large balanced subtree or a
large caterpillar. We also show that there are constants $c, \alpha > 0$ such
that, when both trees are balanced, they have a common subtree on $c n^\alpha$
leaves. We conjecture that it is possible to take $\alpha = 1/2$ in the
unrooted case, and both $c = 1$ and $\alpha = 1/2$ in the rooted case.
