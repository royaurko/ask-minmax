We settle the Path Decomposition Conjecture (P.D.C.) due to Tibor Gallai for
minimally connected graphs, i.e. trees. We use this validity for trees and
settle the P. D. C. using induction on the number of edges for all connected
graphs. We then obtain a new bound for the number of paths in a path cover in
terms of the number of edges using idea of associating a tree with a connected
graph. We then make use of a spanning tree in the given connected graph and its
associated basic path cover to settle the conjecture of Tibor Gallai in an
alternative way. Finally, we show the existence of Hamiltonian path cover
satisfying Gallai bound for complete graphs of even order and discuss some of
its possible ramifications.
