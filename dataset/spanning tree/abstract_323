s\'emantique explicite stratifi\'ee" submitted to TALN 2012.]
  We present an extension of the Explicit Semantic Analysis method by
Gabrilovich and Markovitch. Using their semantic relatedness measure, we weight
the Wikipedia categories graph. Then, we extract a minimal spanning tree, using
Chu-Liu & Edmonds' algorithm. We define a notion of stratified tfidf where the
stratas, for a given Wikipedia page and a given term, are the classical tfidf
and categorical tfidfs of the term in the ancestor categories of the page
(ancestors in the sense of the minimal spanning tree). Our method is based on
this stratified tfidf, which adds extra weight to terms that "survive" when
climbing up the category tree. We evaluate our method by a text classification
on the WikiNews corpus: it increases precision by 18%. Finally, we provide
hints for future research
