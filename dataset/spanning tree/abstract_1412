An upward drawing of a tree is a drawing such that no parents are below their
children. It is order-preserving if the edges to children appear in prescribed
order around each vertex. Chan showed that any tree has an upward
order-preserving drawing with width $O(\log n)$. In this paper, we consider
upward order-preserving drawings where edges are allowed to have bends. We
present a linear-time algorithm that finds such drawings with instance-optimal
width, i.e., the width is the minimum-possible for the input tree. We also
briefly study order-preserving upward straight-line drawings, and show that
some trees require larger width if drawings must additionally be straight-line.
