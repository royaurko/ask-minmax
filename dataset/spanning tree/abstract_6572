One of the main applications of balance indices is in tests of null models of
evolutionary processes. The knowledge of an exact formula for a statistic of a
balance index, holding for any number n of leaves, is necessary in order to use
this statistic in tests of this kind involving trees of any size. In this paper
we obtain exact formulas for the variance under the Yule model of the Sackin
index, the Colless index and the total cophenetic index of binary rooted
phylogenetic trees with n leaves. We also obtain the covariance of the Sackin
and the total cophenetic index.
