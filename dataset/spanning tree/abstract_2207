It is found that the zero field susceptibility chi of the Ising model on the
Cayley tree exhibits unusually weak divergence at the critical point Tc. The
susceptibility amplitude is found to diverge at Tc proportionally to the tree
generation level n, while the behavior of chi is otherwise analytic in the
vicinity of Tc, with the critical exponent gamma=0.
