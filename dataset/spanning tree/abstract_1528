The set of all phylogenetic trees for a fixed set of species forms a geodesic
metric space known as Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann tree-space. In order to analyse
samples of phylogenetic trees it is desirable to construct parametric
distributions on this space, but this task is very challenging. One way to
construct such distributions is to consider particles undergoing Brownian
motion in tree-space from a fixed starting point. The distribution of the
particles after a given duration of time is analogous to a multivariate normal
distribution in Euclidean space. Since these distributions cannot be worked
with directly, we consider approximating by suitably defined random walks in
tree-space. We prove that as the number of steps tends to infinity and the
step-size tends to zero, the distributions obtained by random walk converge to
those corresponding to Brownian motion. This result opens the possibility of
statistical modelling using distributions obtained from Brownian motion on
tree-space.
