We compare three basic kinds of discrete mathematical models used to portray
phylogenetic relationships among species and higher taxa: phylogenetic trees,
Hennig trees and Nelson cladograms. All three models are trees, as that term is
commonly used in mathematics; the difference between them lies in the
biological interpretation of their vertices and edges. Phylogenetic trees and
Hennig trees carry exactly the same information, and translation between these
two kinds of trees can be accomplished by a simple algorithm. On the other
hand, evolutionary concepts such as monophyly are represented as different
mathematical substructures are represented differently in the two models. For
each phylogenetic or Hennig tree, there is a Nelson cladogram carrying the same
information, but the requirement that all taxa be represented by leaves
necessarily makes the representation less efficient. Moreover, we claim that it
is necessary to give some interpretation to the edges and internal vertices of
a Nelson cladogram in order to make it useful as a biological model. One
possibility is to interpret internal vertices as sets of characters and the
edges as statements of inclusion; however, this interpretation carries little
more than incomplete phenetic information. We assert that from the standpoint
of phylogenetics, one is forced to regard each internal vertex of a Nelson
cladogram as an actual (albeit unsampled) species simply to justify the use of
synapomorphies rather than symplesiomorphies.
