We report on a study of the longitudinal to transverse cross section ratio,
$R=\sigma_L/\sigma_T$, at low values of $x$ and $Q^{2}$, as determined from
inclusive inelastic electron-hydrogen and electron-deuterium scattering data
from Jefferson Lab Hall C spanning the four-momentum transfer range 0.06 $ <
Q^{2} < 2.8$ GeV$^{2}$. Even at the lowest values of $Q^{2}$, $R$ remains
nearly constant and does not disappear with decreasing $Q^{2}$, as expected. We
find a nearly identical behaviour for hydrogen and deuterium.
