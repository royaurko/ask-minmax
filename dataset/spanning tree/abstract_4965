Mixture of parts model has been successfully applied to 2D human pose
estimation problem either as explicitly trained body part model or as latent
variables for the whole human body model. Mixture of parts model usually
utilize tree structure for representing relations between body parts. Tree
structures facilitate training and referencing of the model but could not deal
with double counting problems, which hinder its applications in 3D pose
estimation. While most of work targeted to solve these problems tend to modify
the tree models or the optimization target. We incorporate other cues from
input features. For example, in surveillance environments, human silhouettes
can be extracted relative easily although not flawlessly. In this condition, we
can combine extracted human blobs with histogram of gradient feature, which is
commonly used in mixture of parts model for training body part templates. The
method can be easily extend to other candidate features under our generalized
framework. We show 2D body part detection results on a public available
dataset: HumanEva dataset. Furthermore, a 2D to 3D pose estimator is trained
with Gaussian process regression model and 2D body part detections from the
proposed method is fed to the estimator, thus 3D poses are predictable given
new 2D body part detections. We also show results of 3D pose estimation on
HumanEva dataset.
