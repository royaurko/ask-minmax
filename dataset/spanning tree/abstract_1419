A classification of spanning surfaces for alternating links is provided up to
genus, orientability, and a new invariant that we call aggregate slope. That
is, given an alternating link, we determine all possible combinations of genus,
orientability, and aggregate slope that a surface spanning that link can have.
To this end, we describe a straightforward algorithm, much like Seifert's
Algorithm, through which to construct certain spanning surfaces called layered
surfaces. A particularly important subset of these will be what we call basic
layered surfaces. We can alter these surface by performing the entirely local
operations of adding handles and/or crosscaps, each of which increases genus.
  The main result then shows that if we are given an alternating projection
P(L) and a surface S spanning L, we can construct a surface T spanning L with
the same genus, orientability, and aggregate slope as S that is a basic layered
surface with respect to P, except perhaps at a collection of added crosscaps
and/or handles. Furthermore, S must be connected if L is non-splittable. This
result has several useful corollaries. In particular, it allows for the
determination of nonorientable genus for alternating links. It also can be used
to show that mutancy of alternating links preserves nonorientable genus. And it
allows one to prove that there are knots that have a pair of minimal
nonorientable genus spanning surfaces, one boundary-incompressible and one
boundary-compressible.
