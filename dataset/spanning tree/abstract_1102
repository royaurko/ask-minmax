Given a general critical or sub-critical branching mechanism and its
associated L\'evy continuum random tree, we consider a pruning procedure on
this tree using a Poisson snake. It defines a fragmentation process on the
tree. We compute the family of dislocation measures associated with this
fragmentation. This work generalizes the work made for a Brownian tree
[Abraham, Serlet] and for a tree without Brownian part [Abraham, Delmas].
