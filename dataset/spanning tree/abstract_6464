We investigate supersymmetric QCD with gauge group SU(2) and a baryon
deformation to the superpotential. The existence of an uplifted vacuum at the
origin with tree level metastability is demonstrated. When this model is
implemented in a direct gauge mediation scenario we therefore find gaugino
masses which are comparable to sfermion masses and parameterised by an
effective number of messengers 1/8. All deformations are well motivated by
appealing to the electric theory and an R-symmetry. This R-symmetry is
explicitly broken by the same term responsible for supersymmetry breaking.
Moreover, the model does not suffer from the Landau pole problem and we find
that it can be described in terms of just two scales: the weak scale and a high
scale like the Planck or GUT scale. The model can be tested by searching for
new particles at the TeV scale charged under the visible sector gauge group.
