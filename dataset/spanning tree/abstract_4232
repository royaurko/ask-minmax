We compare classes of finite relational structures via monadic second-order
transductions. More precisely, we study the preorder where we set C \subseteq K
if, and only if, there exists a transduction {\tau} such that
C\subseteq{\tau}(K). If we only consider classes of incidence structures we can
completely describe the resulting hierarchy. It is linear of order type
{\omega}+3. Each level can be characterised in terms of a suitable variant of
tree-width. Canonical representatives of the various levels are: the class of
all trees of height n, for each n \in N, of all paths, of all trees, and of all
grids.
