We consider an integral series f(X,t) which depends on the choice of a set X
of labelled planar rooted trees. We prove that its inverse for composition is
of the form f(Z,t) for another set Z of trees, deduced from X. The proof is
self-contained, though inspired by the Koszul duality theory of quadratic
operads.
