Tree-level scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory have recently
been shown to transform covariantly with respect to a 'dual' superconformal
symmetry algebra, thus extending the conventional superconformal symmetry
algebra psu(2,2|4) of the theory. In this paper we derive the action of the
dual superconformal generators in on-shell superspace and extend the dual
generators suitably to leave scattering amplitudes invariant. We then study the
algebra of standard and dual symmetry generators and show that the inclusion of
the dual superconformal generators lifts the psu(2,2|4) symmetry algebra to a
Yangian. The non-local Yangian generators acting on amplitudes turn out to be
cyclically invariant due to special properties of psu(2,2|4). The
representation of the Yangian generators takes the same form as in the case of
local operators, suggesting that the Yangian symmetry is an intrinsic property
of planar N=4 super Yang-Mills, at least at tree level.
