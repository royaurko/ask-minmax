Any ordinary permutation $\tau\in S_n$ of size $n$, written as a word
$\tau=\tau_1...\tau_n$, can be locally classified according to the relative
order of $\tau_j$ to its neighbours. This gives rise to four local order types
called peaks (or maxima), valleys (or minima), double rises and double falls.
By the correspondence between permutations and binary increasing trees the
classification of permutations according to local types corresponds to a
classification of binary increasing trees according to nodes types. Moreover,
by the bijection between permutations, binary increasing trees and suitably
defined path diagrams one can obtain continued fraction representations of the
ordinary generating function of local types. The aim of this work is to
introduce the notion of local types in $k$-Stirling permutations, to relate
these local types with nodes types in $(k+1)$-ary increasing trees and to
obtain a bijection with suitably defined path diagrams. Furthermore, we also
present a path diagram representation of a related tree family called
plane-oriented recursive trees, and the discuss the relation with ternary
increasing trees.
