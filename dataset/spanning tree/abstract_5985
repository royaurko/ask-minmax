We study the parametrized complexity of the Partition into Triangles problem.
For this problem a (simple) graph with 3n vertices is given and the question is
whether it is possible to cover its vertices with n triangles (complete graphs
on 3 vertices). We prove that there is an FPT algorithm that decides the
Partition into Triangles problem and that the existence of a polynomial size
kernel is unlikely (unless NP $\subseteq$ coNP/poly).
