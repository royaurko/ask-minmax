Let R be a two-dimensional regular local ring having an algebraically closed
residue field and let a be a complete ideal of finite colength in R. In this
article we investigate the jumping numbers of a by means of the dual graph of
the minimal log resolution of the pair (X,a). Our main result is a
combinatorial criterium for a positive rational number to be a jumping number.
In particular, we associate to each jumping number certain ordered tree
structures on the dual graph.
