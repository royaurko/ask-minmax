We consider how to index strings, trees and graphs for jumbled pattern
matching when we are asked to return a match if one exists. For example, we
show how, given a tree containing two colours, we can build a quadratic-space
index with which we can find a match in time proportional to the size of the
match. We also show how we need only linear space if we are content with
approximate matches.
