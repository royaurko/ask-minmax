In this paper, we first prove that if the edges of $K_{2m}$ are properly
colored by $2m-1$ colors in such a way that any two colors induce a 2-factor of
which each component is a 4-cycle, then $K_{2m}$ can be decomposed into $m$
isomorphic multicolored spanning trees. Consequently, we show that there exist
three disjoint isomorphic multicolored spanning trees in any properly
(2$m-$1)-edge-colored $K_{2m}$ for $m\geq 14$.
