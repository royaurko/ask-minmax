We show that the number of $t$-ary trees with path length equal to $p$ is
$\exp(h(t^{-1})t\log t \frac{p}{\log p}(1+o(1)))$, where
$\entropy(x){=}{-}x\log x {-}(1{-}x)\log (1{-}x)$ is the binary entropy
function. Besides its intrinsic combinatorial interest, the question recently
arose in the context of information theory, where the number of $t$-ary trees
with path length $p$ estimates the number of universal types, or, equivalently,
the number of different possible Lempel-Ziv'78 dictionaries for sequences of
length $p$ over an alphabet of size $t$.
