In this paper, we propose an incremental algorithm for computing cylindrical
algebraic decompositions. The algorithm consists of two parts: computing a
complex cylindrical tree and refining this complex tree into a cylindrical tree
in real space. The incrementality comes from the first part of the algorithm,
where a complex cylindrical tree is constructed by refining a previous complex
cylindrical tree with a polynomial constraint. We have implemented our
algorithm in Maple. The experimentation shows that the proposed algorithm
outperforms existing ones for many examples taken from the literature.
