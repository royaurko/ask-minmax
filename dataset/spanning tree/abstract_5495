With any convex function F on a finite-dimensional linear space X such that F
goes to infinity at infinity, we associate a Borel measure on the dual space
X*. This measure is obtained by pushing forward the measure exp(-F(x))dx under
the differential of F. We propose a class of convex functions - the
essentially-continuous, convex functions - for which the above correspondence
is in fact a bijection onto the class of finite Borel measures whose barycenter
is at the origin and whose support linearly spans the entire space X*. The
construction is related to toric Kahler-Einstein metrics in complex geometry,
to Pr\'ekopa's inequality, and to the Minkowski problem in convex geometry.
