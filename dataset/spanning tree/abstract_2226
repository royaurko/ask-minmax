Following an argument advanced by Feynman, we consider a method for obtaining
the effective action which generates the sum of tree diagrams with external
physical particles. This technique is applied, in the unbroken \lambda \phi^4
theory, to the derivation of the threshold amplitude for the production of $n$
scalar particles by $n$ initial particles. The leading contributions to the
tree amplitude, which become singular in the threshold limit, exhibit a
factorial growth with n.
