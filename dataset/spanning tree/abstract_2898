We have studied periodicities and correlation properties of tree ring width
chronology of deodar tree from Joshimath (1584 - 1999 years) and Uttarkashi
(1500 - 2002 years) in the western Himalayas and the pre-monsoon
(March-April-May) temperature anomalies (1876 - 2003) relative to 1961 -1990
mean, through wavelet analysis. Periodic behavior is observed in the tree ring
chronology with periodicity in the form 11, 22, and 42 years. The analysis of
the self-similar nature reveals long-range correlation with a Hurst exponent,
$H >0.5$. These are anti-correlated with the temperature anomalies. An
interesting inversion behavior is observed around the year 1750. The power
spectral analysis of the time series corroborate the results of wavelet method.
