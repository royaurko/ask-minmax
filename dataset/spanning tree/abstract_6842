Data mining has been applied in various areas because of its ability to
rapidly analyze vast amounts of data. This study is to build the Graduates
Employment Model using classification task in data mining, and to compare
several of data-mining approaches such as Bayesian method and the Tree method.
The Bayesian method includes 5 algorithms, including AODE, BayesNet, HNB,
NaviveBayes, WAODE. The Tree method includes 5 algorithms, including BFTree,
NBTree, REPTree, ID3, C4.5. The experiment uses a classification task in WEKA,
and we compare the results of each algorithm, where several classification
models were generated. To validate the generated model, the experiments were
conducted using real data collected from graduate profile at the Maejo
University in Thailand. The model is intended to be used for predicting whether
a graduate was employed, unemployed, or in an undetermined situation.
