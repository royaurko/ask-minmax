Combinatorial network optimization algorithms that compute optimal structures
taking into account edge weights form the foundation for many network
protocols. Examples include shortest path routing, minimal spanning tree
computation, maximum weighted matching on bipartite graphs, etc. We present
CLRMR, the first online learning algorithm that efficiently solves the
stochastic version of these problems where the underlying edge weights vary as
independent Markov chains with unknown dynamics.
  The performance of an online learning algorithm is characterized in terms of
regret, defined as the cumulative difference in rewards between a
suitably-defined genie, and that obtained by the given algorithm. We prove
that, compared to a genie that knows the Markov transition matrices and uses
the single-best structure at all times, CLRMR yields regret that is polynomial
in the number of edges and nearly-logarithmic in time.
