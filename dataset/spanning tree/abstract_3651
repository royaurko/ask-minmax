In this paper we study a category of trees TI and prove that it is a Koszul
category. Consequences are the interpretation of the reduced bar construction
of operads of Ginzburg and Kapranov as the Koszul complex of this category, and
the interpretation of operads up to homotopy as a functor from the minimal
resolution of TI to the category of graded vector spaces. We compare also three
different bar constructions of operads. Two of them have already been compared
by Shnider-Von Osdol and Fresse.
