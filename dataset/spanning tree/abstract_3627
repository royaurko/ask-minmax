In the small phylogeny problem we, are given a phylogenetic tree and gene
orders of the extant species and our goal is to reconstruct all of the
ancestral genomes so that the number of evolutionary operations is minimized.
Algorithms for reconstructing evolutionary history from gene orders are usually
based on repeatedly computing medians of genomes at neighbouring vertices of
the tree. We propose a new, more general approach, based on an iterative local
optimization procedure. In each step, we propose candidates for ancestral
genomes and choose the best ones by dynamic programming. We have implemented
our method and used it to reconstruct evolutionary history of 16 yeast mtDNAs
and 13 Campanulaceae cpDNAs.
