Most of the syntax-based metrics obtain the similarity by comparing the
sub-structures extracted from the trees of hypothesis and reference. These
sub-structures are defined by human and can't express all the information in
the trees because of the limited length of sub-structures. In addition, the
overlapped parts between these sub-structures are computed repeatedly. To avoid
these problems, we propose a novel automatic evaluation metric based on
dependency parsing model, with no need to define sub-structures by human.
First, we train a dependency parsing model by the reference dependency tree.
Then we generate the hypothesis dependency tree and the corresponding
probability by the dependency parsing model. The quality of the hypothesis can
be judged by this probability. In order to obtain the lexicon similarity, we
also introduce the unigram F-score to the new metric. Experiment results show
that the new metric gets the state-of-the-art performance on system level, and
is comparable with METEOR on sentence level.
