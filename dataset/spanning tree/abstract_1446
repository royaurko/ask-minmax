This paper establishes connections between the structure of a semigroup and
the minimum spans of distance labellings of its Cayley graphs. We show that
certain general restrictions on the minimum spans are equivalent to the
semigroup being combinatorial, and that other restrictions are equivalent to
the semigroup being a right zero band. We obtain a description of the structure
of all semigroups $S$ and their subsets $C$ such that $\Cay(S,C)$ is a disjoint
union of complete graphs, and show that this description is also equivalent to
several restrictions on the minimum span of $\Cay(S,C)$. We then describe all
graphs with minimum spans satisfying the same restrictions, and give examples
to show that a fairly straightforward upper bound for the minimum spans of the
underlying undirected graphs of Cayley graphs turns out to be sharp even for
the class of combinatorial semigroups.
