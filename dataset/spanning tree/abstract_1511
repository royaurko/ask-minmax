We are interested in the asymptotics of random trees built by linear
preferential attachment, also known in the literature as Barab\'asi-Albert
trees or plane-oriented recursive trees. We first prove a conjecture of Bubeck,
Mossel \& R\'acz concerning the influence of the seed graph on the asymptotic
behavior of such trees. Separately we study the geometric structure of nodes of
large degrees in a plane version of Barab\'asi-Albert trees via their
associated looptrees. As the number of nodes grows, we show that these
looptrees, appropriately rescaled, converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense
towards a random compact metric space which we call the Brownian looptree. The
latter is constructed as a quotient space of Aldous' Brownian Continuum Random
Tree and is shown to have almost sure Hausdorff dimension $2$.
