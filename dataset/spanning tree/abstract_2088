We study the detection error probabilities associated with an M-ary relay
tree, where the leaves of the tree correspond to identical and independent
sensors. Only these leaves are sensors. The root of the tree represents a
fusion center that makes the overall detection decision. Each of the other
nodes in the tree is a relay node that combines M summarized messages from its
immediate child nodes to form a single output message using the majority
dominance rule. We derive tight upper and lower bounds for the Type I and II
error probabilities at the fusion center as explicit functions of the number of
sensors in the case of binary message alphabets. These bounds characterize how
fast the error probabilities converge to 0 with respect to the number of
sensors.
