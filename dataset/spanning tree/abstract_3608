We prove that for any fixed r>=2, the tree-width of graphs not containing K_r
as a topological minor (resp. as a subgraph) is bounded by a linear (resp.
polynomial) function of their rank-width. We also present refinements of our
bounds for other graph classes such as K_r-minor free graphs and graphs of
bounded genus.
