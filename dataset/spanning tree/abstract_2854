In this paper we give an overview of the current state of the graphical
features provided by ILOG OPL Studio for debugging and performance tuning of
OPL programs or external ILOG Solver based applications. This paper focuses on
combining propagation and search information using the Search Tree view and the
Propagation Spy. A new synthetic view is presented: the Christmas Tree, which
combines the Search Tree view with statistics on the efficiency of the domain
reduction and on the number of the propagation events triggered.
