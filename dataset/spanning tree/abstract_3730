Using the pure spinor formalism we prove identities which relate the
tree-level, one-loop and two-loop kinematic factors for massless four-point
amplitudes. From these identities it follows that the complete supersymmetric
one- and two-loop amplitudes are immediately known once the tree-level
kinematic factor is evaluated. In particular, the two-loop equivalence with the
RNS formalism (up to an overall coefficient) is obtained as a corollary.
