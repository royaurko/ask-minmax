We solve the problem of finding interspersed maximal repeats using a suffix
array construction. As it is well known, all the functionality of suffix trees
can be handled by suffix arrays, gaining practicality. Our solution improves
the suffix tree based approaches for the repeat finding problem, being
particularly well suited for very large inputs. We prove the corrrectness and
complexity of the algorithms.
