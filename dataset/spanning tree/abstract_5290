We investigate the focusing $\dot H^{1/2}$-critical nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger
equation (NLS) of Hartree type $i\partial_t u + \Delta u = -(|\cdot|^{-3} \ast
|u|^2)u$ with $\dot H^{1/2}$ radial data in dimension $d = 5$. It is proved
that if the maximal life-span solution obeys
$\sup_{t}\big\||\nabla|^{{1/2}}u\big\|_2 < \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}
\big\||\nabla|^{{1/2}}Q\big\|_2$, where $Q$ is the positive radial solution to
the elliptic equation(\ref{e14}). Then the solution is global and scatters.
