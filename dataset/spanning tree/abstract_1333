We characterize the ``best'' model geometries for the class of virtually free
groups, and we show that there is a countable infinity of distinct ``best''
model geometries in an appropriate sense--these are the maximally symmetric
trees. The first theorem gives several equivalent conditions on a bounded
valence, cocompact tree T without valence 1 vertices saying that T is maximally
symmetric. The second theorem gives general constructions for maximally
symmetric trees, showing for instance that every virtually free group has a
maximally symmetric tree for a model geometry.
