We introduce a new construction of the Uniform Infinite Planar
Quadrangulation (UIPQ). Our approach is based on an extension of the
Cori-Vauquelin-Schaeffer mapping in the context of infinite trees, in the
spirit of previous work. However, we release the positivity constraint on the
labels of trees which was imposed in these references, so that our construction
is technically much simpler. This approach allows us to prove the conjectures
of Krikun pertaining to the "geometry at infinity" of the UIPQ, and to derive
new results about the UIPQ, among which a fine study of infinite geodesics.
