We consider Galton-Watson trees with Geom$(p)$ offspring distribution. We let
$T_{\infty}(p)$ denote such a tree conditioned on being infinite. We prove that
for any $1/2\leq p_1 <p_2 \leq 1$, there exists a coupling between
$T_{\infty}(p_1)$ and $T_{\infty}(p_2)$ such that ${\mathbb P}(T_{\infty}(p_1)
\subseteq T_{\infty}(p_2))=1.$
