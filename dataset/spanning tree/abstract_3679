The N cardinality k ideals of any w-element poset (w, k variable) can be
enumerated in time O(Nw^3). The corresponding bound for k-element subtrees of a
w-element tree is O(Nw^5). An algorithm is described that by the use of
wildcards displays all order ideals of a poset in a compact manner, i.e. not
one by one.
