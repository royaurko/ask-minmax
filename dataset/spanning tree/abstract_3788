Here we present a new fixed parameter tractable algorithm to compute the
hybridization number r of two rooted, not necessarily binary phylogenetic trees
on taxon set X in time (6^r.r!).poly(n)$, where n=|X|. The novelty of this
approach is its use of terminals, which are maximal elements of a natural
partial order on X, and several insights from the softwired clusters
literature. This yields a surprisingly simple and practical bounded-search
algorithm and offers an alternative perspective on the underlying combinatorial
structure of the hybridization number problem.
