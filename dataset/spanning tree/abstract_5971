We define a new stochastic process on general simplicial complexes which
allows to study their spectral and homological properties. Some results for
random walks on graphs are shown to hold in this general setting. As an
application, the process is used to calculate the spectral measure of
high-dimensional analogues of regular trees and to construct solutions to the
high-dimensional Dirichlet problem for forms.
