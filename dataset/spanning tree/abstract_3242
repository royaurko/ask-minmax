Gisin and Popescu [PRL, 83, 432 (1999)] have shown that more information
about their direction can be obtained from a pair of anti-parallel spins
compared to a pair of parallel spins, where the first member of the pair (which
we call the pointer member) can point equally along any direction in the Bloch
sphere. They argued that this was due to the difference in dimensionality
spanned by these two alphabets of states. Here we consider similar alphabets,
but with the first spin restricted to a fixed small circle of the Bloch sphere.
In this case, the dimensionality spanned by the anti-parallel versus parallel
alphabet is now equal. However, the anti-parallel alphabet is found to still
contain more information in general. We generalize this to having N parallel
spins and M anti-parallel spins. When the pointer member is restricted to a
small circle these alphabets again span spaces of equal dimension, yet in
general, more directional information can be found for sets with smaller |N-M|
for any fixed total number of spins. We find that the optimal POVMs for
extracting directional information in these cases can always be expressed in
terms of the Fourier basis. Our results show that dimensionality alone cannot
explain the greater information content in anti-parallel combinations of spins
compared to parallel combinations. In addition, we describe an LOCC protocol
which extract optimal directional information when the pointer member is
restricted to a small circle and a pair of parallel spins are supplied.
