In this paper, we have developed a fully-dynamic algorithm for maintaining
cardinality of maximum-matching in a tree using the construction of top-trees.
The time complexities are as follows:
  1. Initialization Time: $O(n(log(n)))$ to build the Top-tree. 2. Update Time:
$O(log(n))$ 3. Query Time: O(1) to query the cardinality of maximum-matching
and $O(log(n))$ to find if a particular edge is matched.
