We present a general stochastic forest-fire model which shows a variety of
different structures depending on the parameter values. The model contains
three possible states per site (tree, burning tree, empty site) and three
parameters (tree growth probability $p$, lightning probability $f$, and
immunity $g$). We review analytic and computer simulation results for a
quasideterministic state with spiral-shaped fire fronts, for a percolation-like
phase transition and a self-organized critical state. Possible applications to
excitable systems are discussed.
