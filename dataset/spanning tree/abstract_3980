We develop a coarse notion of bundle and use it to understand the coarse
geometry of group extensions and, more generally, groups acting on proper
metric spaces. The results are particularly sharp for groups acting on (locally
finite) trees with Abelian stabilizers, which we are able to classify
completely.
