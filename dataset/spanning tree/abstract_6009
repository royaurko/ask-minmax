We measure the clustering of galaxy groups in the 2dFGRS Percolation-Inferred
Galaxy Group (2PIGG) catalogue. The 2PIGG sample has 29,000 groups with at
least two members. The clustering amplitude of the full 2PIGG catalogue is
weaker than that of 2dFGRS galaxies, in agreement with theoretical predictions.
We have subdivided the 2PIGG catalogue into samples that span a factor of 25 in
median total luminosity. Our correlation function measurements span an
unprecedented range of clustering strengths, connecting the regimes probed by
groups fainter than L* galaxies and rich clusters. There is a steady increase
in clustering strength with group luminosity; the most luminous groups are ten
times more strongly clustered than the full 2PIGG catalogue. We demonstrate
that the 2PIGG results are in very good agreement with the clustering of groups
expected in the LCDM model.
