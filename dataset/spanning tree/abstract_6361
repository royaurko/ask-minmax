We use a combination of analytic models and computer simulations to gain
insight into the dynamics of evolution. Our results suggest that certain
interesting phenomena should eventually emerge from the fossil record. For
example, there should be a ``tortoise and hare effect'': Those genera with the
smallest species death rate are likely to survive much longer than genera with
large species birth and death rates. A complete characterization of the
behavior of a branch of the phylogenetic tree corresponding to a genus and
accurate mathematical representations of the various stages are obtained. We
apply our results to address certain controversial issues that have arisen in
paleontology such as the importance of punctuated equilibrium and whether
unique Cambrian phyla have survived to the present.
