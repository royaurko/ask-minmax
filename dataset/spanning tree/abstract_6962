We study the average leaf-to-leaf path lengths on ordered Catalan tree graphs
with $n$ nodes and show that these are equivalent to the average length of
paths starting from the root node. We give an explicit analytic formula for the
average leaf-to-leaf path length as a function of separation of the leaves and
study its asymptotic properties. At the heart of our method is a strategy based
on an abstract graph representation of generating functions which we hope can
be useful also in other contexts.
