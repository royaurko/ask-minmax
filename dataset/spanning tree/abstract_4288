We introduce bidendriform bialgebras, which are bialgebras such that both
product and coproduct can be split into two parts satisfying good
compatibilities. For example, the Malvenuto-Reutenauer Hopf algebra and the
non-commutative Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebras of planar decorated rooted trees
are bidendriform bialgebras. We prove that all connected bidendriform
bialgebras are generated by their primitive elements as a dendriform algebra
bidendriform Milnor-Moore theorem) and then is isomorphic to a Connes-Kreimer
Hopf algebra. As a corollary, the Hopf algebra of Malvenuto-Reutenauer is
isomorphic to the Connes-kreimer Hopf algebra of planar rooted trees decorated
by a certain set. We deduce that the Lie algebra of its primitive elements is
free in characteristic zero (G. Duchamp, F. Hivert and J.-Y. Thibon
conjecture).
