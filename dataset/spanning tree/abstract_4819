The rates-across-sites assumption in phylogenetic inference posits that the
rate matrix governing the Markovian evolution of a character on an edge of the
putative phylogenetic tree is the product of a character-specific scale factor
and a rate matrix that is particular to that edge. Thus, evolution follows
basically the same process for all characters, except that it occurs faster for
some characters than others. To allow estimation of tree topologies and edge
lengths for such models, it is commonly assumed that the scale factors are not
arbitrary unknown constants, but rather unobserved, independent, identically
distributed draws from a member of some parametric family of distributions. A
popular choice is the gamma family. We consider an example of a clock-like tree
with three taxa, one unknown edge length, and a parametric family of scale
factor distributions that contain the gamma family. This model has the property
that, for a generic choice of unknown edge length and scale factor
distribution, there is another edge length and scale factor distribution which
generates data with exactly the same distribution, so that even with infinitely
many data it will be typically impossible to make correct inferences about the
unknown edge length.
