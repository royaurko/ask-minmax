We define and study the Tutte polynomial of a hyperplane arrangement. We
introduce a method for computing it by solving an enumerative problem in a
finite field. For specific arrangements, the computation of Tutte polynomials
is then reduced to certain related enumerative questions. As a consequence, we
obtain new formulas for the generating functions enumerating alternating trees,
labelled trees, semiorders and Dyck paths.
