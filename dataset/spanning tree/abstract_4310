We show that a compact n-polyhedron PL embeds in a product of n trees if and
only if it collapses onto an (n-1)-polyhedron. If the n-polyhedron is
contractible and n\ne 3 (or n=3 and the Andrews-Curtis Conjecture holds), the
product of trees may be assumed to collapse onto the image of the embedding.
  In contrast, there exists a 2-dimensional compact absolute retract X such
that X\times I^k does not embed in any product of 2+k dendrites for each k.
