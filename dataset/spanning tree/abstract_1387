Neutral macroevolutionary models, such as the Yule model, give rise to a
probability distribution on the set of discrete rooted binary trees over a
given leaf set. Such models can provide a signal as to the approximate location
of the root when only the unrooted phylogenetic tree is known, and this signal
becomes relatively more significant as the number of leaves grows. In this
short note, we show that among models that treat all taxa equally, and are
sampling consistent (i.e. the distribution on trees is not affected by taxa yet
to be included), all such models, except one, convey some information as to the
location of the ancestral root in an unrooted tree.
