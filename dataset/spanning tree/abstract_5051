The two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model with Gaussian bond distribution is
investigated at T=0 with a numerical method. Droplet excitations are directly
observed. It turns out that the averaged volume of droplets is proportional to
l^D with D = 1.80(2) where l is the spanning length of droplets, revealing
their fractal nature. The exponent characterizing the l dependence of the
droplet excitation energy is estimated to be -0.42(4), clearly different from
the stiffness exponent for domain wall excitations.
