Let T be a homogeneous tree and L the Laplace operator on T. We consider the
semilinear Schrodinger equation associated to L with a power-like nonlinearity
F of degree d. We first obtain dispersive estimates and Strichartz estimates
with no admissibility conditions. We next deduce global well-posedness for
small L2 data with no gauge invariance assumption on the nonlinearity F. On the
other hand if F is gauge invariant, L2 conservation leads to global
well-posedness for arbitrary L2 data. Notice that, in contrast with the
Euclidean case, these global well-posedness results hold with no restriction on
d > 1. We finally prove scattering for small L2 data, with no gauge invariance
assumption.
