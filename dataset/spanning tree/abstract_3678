Game tree search algorithms such as minimax have been used with enormous
success in turn-based adversarial games such as Chess or Checkers. However,
such algorithms cannot be directly applied to real-time strategy (RTS) games
because a number of reasons. For example, minimax assumes a turn-taking game
mechanics, not present in RTS games. In this paper we present RTMM, a real-time
variant of the standard minimax algorithm, and discuss its applicability in the
context of RTS games. We discuss its strengths and weaknesses, and evaluate it
in two real-time games.
