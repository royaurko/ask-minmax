We develop a battery of tools for studying quasi-isometric rigidity and
classification problems for splittings of groups. The techniques work best for
finite graphs of groups where all edge and vertex groups are coarse PD groups.
For example, if Gamma is a graph of coarse PD(n) groups for a fixed n, if the
Bass-Serre tree of Gamma has infinitely many ends, and if H is a finitely
generated group quasi-isometric to pi_1(Gamma), then we prove that H is the
fundamental group of a graph of coarse PD(n) groups, with vertex and edge
groups quasi-isometric to those of Gamma. We also have quasi-isometric rigidity
theorems for graphs of coarse PD groups of nonconstant dimension, under various
assumptions on the edge-to-vertex group inclusions.
