Cayley's formula states that there are $n^{n-2}$ spanning trees in the
complete graph on $n$ vertices; it has been proved in more than a dozen
different ways over its 150 year history. The complete graphs are a special
case of threshold graphs, and using Merris' Theorem and the Matrix Tree
Theorem, there is a strikingly simple formula for counting the number of
spanning trees in a threshold graph on $n$ vertices; it is simply the product,
over $i=2,3, ...,n-1$, of the number of vertices of degree at least $i$. In
this manuscript, we provide a direct combinatorial proof for this formula which
does not use the Matrix Tree Theorem; the proof is an extension of Joyal's
proof for Cayley's formula. Then we apply this methodology to give a formula
for the number of spanning trees in any difference graph.
