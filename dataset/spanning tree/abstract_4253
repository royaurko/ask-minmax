The boxicity of a graph G, denoted as box(G) is defined as the minimum
integer t such that G is an intersection graph of axis-parallel t-dimensional
boxes. A graph G is a k-leaf power if there exists a tree T such that the
leaves of the tree correspond to the vertices of G and two vertices in G are
adjacent if and only if their corresponding leaves in T are at a distance of at
most k. Leaf powers are a subclass of strongly chordal graphs and are used in
the construction of phylogenetic trees in evolutionary biology. We show that
for a k-leaf power G, box(G)\leq k-1. We also show the tightness of this bound
by constructing a k-leaf power with boxicity equal to k-1. This result implies
that there exists strongly chordal graphs with arbitrarily high boxicity which
is somewhat counterintuitive.
