We prove that when a class of partial differential equations, generalized
from the cable equation, is defined on tree graphs, and when the inputs are
restricted to a spatially discrete set of points, the Green's function (GF)
formalism can be rewritten to scale as $O(n)$ with the number $n$ of inputs
locations, contrarily to the previously reported $O(n^2)$ scaling. We show that
the linear scaling can be combined with an expansion of the remaining kernels
as sums of exponentials, to allow efficient simulations of equations from the
aforementioned class. We furthermore validate this simulation paradigm on
models of nerve cells and explore its relation with more traditional finite
difference approaches. Situations in which a gain in computational performance
is expected, are discussed.
