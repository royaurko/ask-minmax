For two decades, the Colless index has been the most frequently used
statistic for assessing the balance of phylogenetic trees. In this article,
this statistic is studied under the Yule and uniform model of phylogenetic
trees. The main tool of analysis is a coupling argument with another well-known
index called the Sackin statistic. Asymptotics for the mean, variance and
covariance of these two statistics are obtained, as well as their limiting
joint distribution for large phylogenies. Under the Yule model, the limiting
distribution arises as a solution of a functional fixed point equation. Under
the uniform model, the limiting distribution is the Airy distribution. The
cornerstone of this study is the fact that the probabilistic models for
phylogenetic trees are strongly related to the random permutation and the
Catalan models for binary search trees.
