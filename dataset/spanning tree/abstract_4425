It is well known that in the MSSM the lightest neutral Higgs h^0 must be, at
the tree level, lighter than the Z boson and that the loop corrections shift
this stringent upper bound up to about 130 GeV. Extending the MSSM gauge group
in a suitable way, the new Higgs sector dynamics can push the tree-level mass
of h^0 well above the tree-level MSSM limit if it couples to the new gauge
sector. This effect is further pronounced at the loop level and h^0 masses in
the 140 GeV ballpark can be reached easily. We exemplify this for a sample
setting with a low-scale U(1)_R x U(1)_B-L gauge symmetry in which neutrino
masses can be implemented via the inverse seesaw mechanism.
