We study the minimal/endogenous solution $R$ to the maximum recursion on
weighted branching trees given by
$$R\stackrel{\mathcal{D}}{=}\left(\bigvee_{i=1}^NC_iR_i \right)\vee Q,$$ where
$(Q,N,C_1,C_2,\dots)$ is a random vector with $N\in \mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$,
$P(|Q|>0)>0$ and nonnegative weights $\{C_i\}$, and $\{R_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$
is a sequence of i.i.d. copies of $R$ independent of $(Q,N,C_1,C_2,\dots)$;
$\stackrel{\mathcal{D}}{=}$ denotes equality in distribution. Furthermore, when
$Q>0$ this recursion can be transformed into its additive equivalent, which
corresponds to the maximum of a branching random walk and is also known as a
high-order Lindley equation. We show that, under natural conditions, the
asymptotic behavior of $R$ is power-law, i.e., $P(|R|>x)\sim Hx^{-\alpha}$, for
some $\alpha>0$ and $H>0$. This has direct implications for the tail behavior
of other well known branching recursions.
