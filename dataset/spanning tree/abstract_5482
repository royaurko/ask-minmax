This work is about symbolic powers of codimension two perfect ideals in a
standard polynomial ring over a field, where the entries of the corresponding
presentation matrix are general linear forms. The main contribution of the
present approach is the use of the birational theory underlying the nature of
the ideal and the details of a deep interlacing between generators of its
symbolic powers and the inversion factors stemming from the inverse map to the
birational map defined by the linear system spanned by the generators of this
ideal. A full description of the corresponding symbolic Rees algebra is given
in some cases.
