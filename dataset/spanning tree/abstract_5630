Let $C_6^3$ be the 3-uniform hypergraph on $\{1,\dots, 6\}$ with edges $123,
345,561$, which can be seen as the triangle in 3-uniform hypergraphs. For
sufficiently large $n$ divisible by 6, we show that every $n$-vertex 3-uniform
hypergraph $H$ with minimum codegree at least $n/3$ contains a $C_6^3$-factor,
i.e., a spanning subhypergraph consisting of vertex-disjoint copies of $C_6^3$.
The minimum codegree condition is best possible. This improves the asymptotical
result obtained by Mycroft and answers a question of R\"odl and Ruci\'nski
exactly.
