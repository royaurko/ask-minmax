We summarize ideas and methods that apply to rigidity and connectivity
percolation. These include: constraint counting concepts, exact calculations on
diluted trees and numerical results on diluted lattices using matching
algorithms. The similarities and differences between connectivity and rigidity
percolation are discussed.
