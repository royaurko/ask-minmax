In 2005 Janson, extending earlier work of Mahmoud, Smythe, and Szyma\'nski,
established the joint asymptotic normality of the outdegrees of a random plane
recursive tree. In particular, he gave an explicit description of the limiting
covariance matrix. Our aim here is to provide substantially simplified
expression for the limiting covariance matrix.
