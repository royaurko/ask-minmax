We consider different online algorithms for a generalized scheduling problem
for parallel machines, described in details in the first section. This problem
is the generalization of the classical parallel machine scheduling problem,
when the make-span is minimized; in that case each job contains only one task.
On the other hand, the problem in consideration is still a special version of
the workflow scheduling problem. We present several heuristic algorithms and
compare them by computer tests.
