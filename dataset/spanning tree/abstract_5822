We investigate the electroweak precision constraints on the recently proposed
Lee-Wick Standard Model at tree level. We analyze low energy, Z-pole (LEP1/SLC)
and LEP2 data separately. We derive the exact tree level low energy and Z-pole
effective Lagrangians from both the auxiliary field and higher derivative
formulation of the theory. For the LEP2 data we use the fact that the Lee-Wick
Standard Model belongs to the so-called 'universal class' which can be
described by seven oblique parameters at leading order in m_W^2/M_{1,2}^2. At
tree level we find that the only non-zero oblique parameters are Y =
-m_W^2/M_1^2 and W = -m_W^2/M_2^2, where the negative sign is due to the
presence of the negative norm states. The Lee-Wick operators do not violate the
SU(2)_L or custodial symmetry at tree level implying S=0 and T=0 respectively.
Our results differ substantially from a prior analysis in this respect. We show
a plot including all three constraints. The LEP1/SLC constraints are slightly
stronger than LEP2 and much stronger than the low energy ones. The LEP1/SLC
results exclude gauge boson masses of M_1 ~ M_2 ~ 3 TeV at the 99% confidence
level. Somewhat lower masses are possible when one of the masses assumes a
large value. Loop corrections to the electroweak observables are suppressed by
the standard ~1/(4 \pi)^2 factor and are therefore not expected to change the
constraints on M_1 and M_2. This assertion is most transparent from the higher
derivative formulation of the theory.
