A classical problem in phylogenetic tree analysis is to decide whether there
is a phylogenetic tree $T$ that contains all information of a given collection
$\cP$ of phylogenetic trees. If the answer is "yes" we say that $\cP$ is
compatible and $T$ displays $\cP$. This decision problem is NP-complete even if
all input trees are quartets, that is binary trees with exactly four leaves. In
this paper, we prove a sufficient condition for a set of binary phylogenetic
trees to be compatible. That result is used to give a short and self-contained
proof of the known characterization of quartet sets of minimal cardinality
which are displayed by a unique phylogenetic tree.
