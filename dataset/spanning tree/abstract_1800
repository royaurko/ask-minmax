Periodic trees are combinatorial structures which are in bijection with
cluster tilting objects in cluster categories of affine type $\tilde{A}_{n-1}$.
The internal edges of the tree encode the $c$-vectors corresponding to the
cluster tilting object, as well as the weights of the virtual semi-invariants
associated to the cluster tilting object. We also show a direct relationship
between the position of the edges of the tree and whether the corresponding
summands of the cluster tilting object are preprojective, preinjective or
regular.
