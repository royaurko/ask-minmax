Colour parameters of European beech were measured using CIELab system. 103
logs from 87 trees in 9 sites were cut into boards to study the variations of
wood colour parameters. Both site and tree effect on colour were observed.
Patterns of red heartwood occurrence were defined. When excepting red heartwood
there was still a highly significant effect of site and tree; differences
remained after veneer processing. Axial variations were small, except very near
the pith or in red heartwood, suggesting possible early selection at periphery
under colour criteria. Red heartwood is darker, redder and more yellow than
normal peripheral wood.
