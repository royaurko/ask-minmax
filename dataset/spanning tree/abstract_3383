We calculate the spectral dimension of a wide class of tree-like fractals by
solving the random walk problem through a new analytical technique, based on
invariance under generalized cutting-decimation transformations. These fractals
are generalizations of the NTD lattices and they are characterized by non
integer spectral dimension equal or greater then 2, non anomalous diffusion
laws, dynamical dimension splitting and absence of phase transitions for spin
models.
