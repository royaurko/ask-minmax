We investigate the directed random walk on hierarchic trees. Two cases are
investigated: random variables on deterministic trees with a continuous
branching, and random variables on the trees constructed trough the random
branching process. We derive renormalization group (partial differential)
equations for the branching models with binomial, Poisson and compound Poisson
distributions of random variables on the links of tree. These renormaliation
group equations are new class of reaction-diffusion equations in 1-dimension.
