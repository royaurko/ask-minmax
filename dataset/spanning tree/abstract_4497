We study a probability distribution d on the truth assignments to a uniform
binary AND-OR tree. Liu and Tanaka [2007, Inform. Process. Lett.] showed the
following: If d achieves the equilibrium among independent distributions (ID)
then d is an independent identical distribution (IID). We show a stronger form
of the above result. Given a real number r such that 0 < r < 1, we consider a
constraint that the probability of the root node having the value 0 is r. Our
main result is the following: When we restrict ourselves to IDs satisfying this
constraint, the above result of Liu and Tanaka still holds. The proof employs
clever tricks of induction. In particular, we show two fundamental
relationships between expected cost and probability in an IID on an OR-AND
tree: (1) The ratio of the cost to the probability (of the root having the
value 0) is a decreasing function of the probability x of the leaf. (2) The
ratio of derivative of the cost to the derivative of the probability is a
decreasing function of x, too.
