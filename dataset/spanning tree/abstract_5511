We present searches for heavy top and bottom quark partners at CMS using data
collected at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. Such partners, if vector-like, occur in models
such as the Little Higgs and Large Extra Dimensions. Fermionic top partners
could also occur in composite Higgs models. The searches presented here span a
wide range of final states, from lepton plus jets to multi-leptonic, and
exclusion limits are set on mass and production cross sections as a function of
branching ratios of the heavy quarks to their decay products.
