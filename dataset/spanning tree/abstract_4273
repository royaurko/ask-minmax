Within the framework of QCD factorization (QCDF), we consider two different
types of power correction effects in order to resolve the CP puzzles and rate
deficit problems with penguin-dominated two-body decays of B mesons and
color-suppressed tree-dominated $\pi^0\pi^0$ and $\rho^0\pi^0$ modes: penguin
annihilation and soft corrections to the color-suppressed tree amplitude. We
emphasize that the electroweak penguin solution to the $B\to K\pi$ CP puzzle
via New Physics is irrelevant for solving the CP and rate puzzles related to
tree-dominated decays. While some channels e.g.
$K^-\pi^+,K^-\rho^0,\pi^+\pi^-,\rho^\pm\pi^\mp$ need penguin annihilation to
induce the correct magnitudes and signs for their CP violation, some other
decays such as $B^-\to K^-\pi^0,\pi^-\eta, K^-\eta$ and $\bar B^0\to \bar
K^{*0}\eta,\pi^0\pi^0$ require the presence of both power corrections to
account for the measured CP asymmetries. In general, QCDF predictions for the
branching fractions and direct CP asymmetries of $\bar B\to PP,VP,VV$ decays
are in good agreement with experiment. The predictions of pQCD and
soft-collinear effective theory are included for comparison.
