Weak bisimilarity is a distribution-based equivalence notion for Markov
automata. It has gained some popularity as the coarsest reasonable behavioural
equivalence on Markov automata. This paper studies a strictly coarser notion:
Late weak bisimilarity enjoys valuable properties if restricting to important
subclasses of schedulers: Trace distribution equivalence is implied for partial
information schedulers, and compositionality is preserved by distributed
schedulers. The intersection of the two scheduler classes thus spans a coarser
and still reasonable compositional theory of Markov automata.
