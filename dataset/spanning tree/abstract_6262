We use heterotic/type-II prepotentials to study quantum/classical black holes
with half the $N=2, D=4$ supersymmetries unbroken. We show that, in the case of
heterotic string compactifications, the perturbatively corrected entropy
formula is given by the tree-level entropy formula with the tree-level coupling
constant replaced by the perturbative coupling constant. In the case of type-II
compactifications, we display a new entropy/area formula associated with
axion-free black-hole solutions, which depends on the electric and magnetic
charges as well as on certain topological data of Calabi--Yau three-folds,
namely the intersection numbers, the second Chern class and the Euler number of
the three-fold. We show that, for both heterotic and type-II theories, there is
the possibility to relax the usual requirement of the non-vanishing of some of
the charges and still have a finite entropy.
