We develop the concept of ABC-Boost (Adaptive Base Class Boost) for
multi-class classification and present ABC-MART, a concrete implementation of
ABC-Boost. The original MART (Multiple Additive Regression Trees) algorithm has
been very successful in large-scale applications. For binary classification,
ABC-MART recovers MART. For multi-class classification, ABC-MART considerably
improves MART, as evaluated on several public data sets.
