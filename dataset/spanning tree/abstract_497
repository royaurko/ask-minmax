We introduce a class of "inverse parametric optimization" problems, in which
one is given both a parametric optimization problem and a desired optimal
solution; the task is to determine parameter values that lead to the given
solution. We describe algorithms for solving such problems for minimum spanning
trees, shortest paths, and other "optimal subgraph" problems, and discuss
applications in multicast routing, vehicle path planning, resource allocation,
and board game programming.
