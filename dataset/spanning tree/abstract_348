We review a range of stastistical methods for analyzing the structures of
star clusters, and derive a new measure ${\cal Q}$ which both quantifies, and
distinguishes between, a (relatively smooth) large-scale radial density
gradient and multi-scale (fractal) sub-clustering. Q is derived from the
normalised correlation length and the normalised edge length of the minimal
spanning tree for each cluster.
