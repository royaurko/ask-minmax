Phylogenomic approaches developed thus far are either too time-consuming or
lack a solid evolutionary basis. Moreover, no phylogenomic approach is capable
of constructing a tree directly from unassembled raw sequencing data. A new
phylogenomic method, CO-phylum, is developed to alleviate these flaws.
CO-phylum can generate a high-resolution and highly accurate tree using
complete genome or unassembled sequencing data of close related organisms, in
addition, CO-phylum distance is almost linear with p-distance.
