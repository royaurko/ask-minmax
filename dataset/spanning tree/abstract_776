A solvency cone is a polyhedral convex cone which is used in Mathematical
Finance to model proportional transaction costs. It consists of those
portfolios which can be traded into nonnegative positions. In this note, we
provide a characterization of its dual cone in terms of extreme directions and
discuss some consequences, among them: (i) an algorithm to construct extreme
directions of the dual cone when a corresponding "contribution scheme" is
given; (ii) estimates for the number of extreme directions; (iii) an explicit
representation of the dual cone for special cases. The validation of the
algorithm is based on the following easy-to-state but difficult-to-solve result
on bipartite graphs: Running over all spanning trees of a bipartite graph, the
number of left degree sequences equals the number of right degree sequences.
