We consider systems of interacting diffusions with local population
regulation. Our main result shows that the total mass process of such a system
is bounded above by the total mass process of a tree of excursions with
appropriate drift and diffusion coefficients. As a corollary, this entails a
sufficient, explicit condition for extinction of the total mass as time tends
to infinity. On the way to our comparison result, we establish that systems of
interacting diffusions with uniform migration between finitely many islands
converge to a tree of excursions as the number of islands tends to infinity. In
the special case of logistic branching, this leads to a duality between the
tree of excursions and the solution of a McKean-Vlasov equation.
