We extend the algorithm for matching fixed-order tree-level matrix element
generators with the Dipole Cascade Model in Ariadne to apply to processes with
incoming hadrons. We test the algoritm on for the process W+n jets at the
Tevatron, and find that the results are fairly insensitive to the cutoff used
to regularize the soft and collinear divergencies in the tree-level matrix
elements. We also investigate a few observables to check the sensitivity to the
matrix element correction.
