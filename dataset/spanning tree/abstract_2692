These are the notes for a series of lectures given at the Clay Mathematical
Institute Summer School in Buzios, July 11 - August 7, 2010. We review some of
the recent aspects of scaling limits of random trees and planar maps, in
particular via their relations with bijective enumeration and Gromov-Hausdorff
convergence.
