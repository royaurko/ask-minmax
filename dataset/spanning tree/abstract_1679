Let $T\_n$ denote the set of unrooted labeled trees of size $n$ and let
$T\_n$ be a particular (finite, unlabeled) tree. Assuming that every tree of
$T\_n$ is equally likely, it is shown that the limiting distribution as $n$
goes to infinity of the number of occurrences of $M$ as an induced subtree is
asymptotically normal with mean value and variance asymptotically equivalent to
$\mu n$ and $\sigma^2n$, respectively, where the constants $\mu>0$ and
$\sigma\ge 0$ are computable.
