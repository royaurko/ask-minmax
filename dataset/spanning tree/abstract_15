We study simple random walk on the uniform spanning tree on Z^2 . We obtain
estimates for the transition probabilities of the random walk, the distance of
the walk from its starting point after n steps, and exit times of both
Euclidean balls and balls in the intrinsic graph metric. In particular, we
prove that the spectral dimension of the uniform spanning tree on Z^2 is 16/13
almost surely.
