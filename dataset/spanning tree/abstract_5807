If in a finite universe, the tree-level vacuum is a symmetric superposition
of coherent states, in each of which the inflaton field assumes a different,
energy-minimizing mean value (vev), then the resulting energy is positive and
decreases exponentially as the volume of the universe increases. This effect
can drive inflation when that volume is small and explain part of dark energy
when it is big, but the effect is exceedingly tiny except at very early times.
