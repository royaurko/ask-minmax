By rewriting the famous hook-content formula it easily follows that there are
$\prod\limits_{1 \le i < j \le n} \frac{k_j - k_i + j -i}{j-i}$ semistandard
tableaux of shape $(k_n,k_{n-1},...,k_1)$ with entries in $\{1,2,...,n\}$ or,
equivalently, Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns with bottom row $(k_1,...,k_n)$. In this
article we introduce certain sequences of labeled trees, the signed enumeration
of which is also given by this formula. In these trees, vertices as well as
edges are labeled, the crucial condition being that each edge label lies
between the vertex labels of the two endpoints of the edge. This notion enables
us to give combinatorial explanations of the shifted antisymmetry of the
formula and its polynomiality. Furthermore, we propose to develop an analog
approach of combinatorial reasoning for monotone triangles and explain how this
may lead to a combinatorial understanding of the alternating sign matrix
theorem.
