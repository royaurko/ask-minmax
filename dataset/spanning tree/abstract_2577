We address the following question: what are the cardinalities of maximal
finite families of pairwise incident planes in a complex projective space? One
proves easily that the span of the planes has dimension 5 or 6. Up to
projectivities there is one such family spanning a 6-dimensional projective
space - this is an elementary result. Maximal finite families of pairwise
incident planes in a 5-dimensional projective space are considerably more
misterious: they are linked to certain special (EPW) sextic hypersurfaces which
have a non-trivial double cover, generically a hyperkaehler 4-fold. We prove
that the cardinality of such a set cannot exceed 20. We also show that there
exist such families of cardinality 16 - in fact we conjecture that 16 is the
maximum.
