We discuss the interbasin kinetics approximation for random walk on a complex
landscape. We show that for a generic landscape the corresponding model of
interbasin kinetics is equivalent to an ultrametric diffusion, generated by an
ultrametric pseudodifferential operator on the ultrametric space related to the
tree of basins. The simplest example of ultrametric diffusion of this kind is
described by the p-adic heat equation.
