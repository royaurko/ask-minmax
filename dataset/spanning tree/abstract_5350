We find a Hermite-type basis for which the eigenvalue problem associated to
the operator $H_{A,B}:=B(-\partial_x^2)+Ax^2$ acting on $L^2({\bf R};{\bf
C}^2)$ becomes a three-terms recurrence. Here $A$ and $B$ are two constant
positive definite matrices with no other restriction. Our main result provides
an explicit characterization of the eigenvectors of $H_{A,B}$ that lie in the
span of the first four elements of this basis when $AB\not= BA$.
