Energy efficiency is the most important issue in all facets of wireless
sensor networks (WSNs) operations because of the limited and non-replenish able
energy supply. Data aggregation mechanism is one of the possible solutions to
prolong the life time of sensor nodes and on the other hand it also helps in
eliminating the data redundancy and improving the accuracy of information
gathering, is essential for WSNs. In this paper we propose a Clustering based
lifetime maximizing aggregation tree (CLMAT) in which we create aggregation
tree which aim to reduce energy consumption, minimizing the distance traversed
and minimizing the cost in terms of energy consumption. In CLMAT the node
having maximum available energy is used as parent node/ aggregator node. We
concluded with the best possible aggregation tree minimizing energy
utilization, minimizing cost and hence maximizing network lifetime.
