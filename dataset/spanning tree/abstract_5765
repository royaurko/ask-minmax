We propose a scheme for efficient construction of graph states using
realistic linear optics, imperfect photon source and single-photon detectors.
For any many-body entanglement represented by tree graph states, we prove that
the overall preparation and detection efficiency scales only polynomially with
the size of the graph, no matter how small the efficiencies for the photon
source and the detectors.
