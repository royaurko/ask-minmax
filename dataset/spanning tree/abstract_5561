We survey the general theory of groupoids, groupoid actions, groupoid
principal bundles, and various kinds of morphisms between groupoids in the
framework of categories with pretopology. We study extra assumptions on
pretopologies that are needed for this theory. We check these extra assumptions
in several categories with pretopologies.
  Functors between groupoids may be localised at equivalences in two ways. One
uses spans of functors, the other bibundles (commuting actions) of groupoids.
We show that both approaches give equivalent bicategories. Another type of
groupoid morphisms, called actors, are closely related to functors between the
categories of groupoid actions. We also generalise actors using bibundles, and
show that this gives another bicategory of groupoids.
