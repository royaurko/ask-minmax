By imposing a specific $S_{3}$ discrete symmetry for fermions and scalars, we
extend the group of the model based on the gauge symmetry $SU(3)_{C}\otimes
SU(3)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{X}$. We found that after the symmetry breaking of the
continuous group, all the down type quarks acquire tree level masses, while in
the up sector only the top quark and a new heavy T quark obtain masses at tree
level. By imposing hierarchical Yukawa couplings between the ordinary down-type
quarks and new heavy down-type quarks, we may explain the relation
$m_{d}<<m_{s}<<m_{b}$. The massless up-type quarks get small mass terms through
effective six dimensional operators according to the gauge and discrete
symmetries. In particular, the smallness of the u quark can be understood by a
small deviation in the universality of the dimensionless couplings associated
to the effective operators. We also obtain with only four free parameters, the
magnitudes of the CKM matrix elements and the Jarlskog invariant, within
experimental error values.
