Greedy heuristics may be attuned by looking ahead for each possible choice,
in an approach called the rollout or Pilot method. These methods may be seen as
meta-heuristics that can enhance (any) heuristic solution, by repetitively
modifying a master solution: similarly to what is done in game tree search,
better choices are identified using lookahead, based on solutions obtained by
repeatedly using a greedy heuristic. This paper first illustrates how the Pilot
method improves upon some simple well known dispatch heuristics for the
job-shop scheduling problem. The Pilot method is then shown to be a special
case of the more recent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods: Unlike the
Pilot method, MCTS methods use random completion of partial solutions to
identify promising branches of the tree. The Pilot method and a simple version
of MCTS, using the $\varepsilon$-greedy exploration paradigms, are then
compared within the same framework, consisting of 300 scheduling problems of
varying sizes with fixed-budget of rollouts. Results demonstrate that MCTS
reaches better or same results as the Pilot methods in this context.
