We construct 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 BPS solutions spanned by diagonal elements of
U(N) constant fluxes in the 6+1 dimensional U(N) super Yang-Mills theory on T^6
with topological stability. These solutions represent BPS bound states of D0,
D2, D4, and D6 branes. The consistency with the D-brane charge conservation
implies that unstable D0-D2-D6-brane systems in a B field decay to the BPS
solutions, in which lower dimensional D-branes are dissolved in D6-branes.
