In a variety of applications, we need to keep track of the development of a
data set over time. For maintaining and querying this multi version data
I/O-efficiently, external memory data structures are required. In this paper,
we present a probabilistic self-balancing persistent data structure in external
memory called the persistent buffer tree, which supports insertions, updates
and deletions of data items at the present version and range queries for any
version, past or present. The persistent buffer tree is I/O-optimal in the
sense that the expected amortized I/O performance bounds are asymptotically the
same as the deterministic amortized bounds of the (single version) buffer tree
in the worst case.
