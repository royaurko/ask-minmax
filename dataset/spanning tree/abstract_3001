With the development of connected filters for the last decade, many
algorithms have been proposed to compute the max-tree. Max-tree allows to
compute the most advanced connected operators in a simple way. However, no fair
comparison of algorithms has been proposed yet and the choice of an algorithm
over an other depends on many parameters. Since the need of fast algorithms is
obvious for production code, we present an in depth comparison of five
algorithms and some variations of them in a unique framework. Finally, a
decision tree will be proposed to help user in choosing the right algorithm
with respect to their data.
