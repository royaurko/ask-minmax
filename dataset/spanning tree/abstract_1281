We give a unified treatment of the limit, as the size tends to infinity, of
simply generated random trees, including both the well-known result in the
standard case of critical Galton--Watson trees and similar but less well-known
results in the other cases (i.e., when no equivalent critical Galton--Watson
tree exists). There is a well-defined limit in the form of an infinite random
tree in all cases; for critical Galton--Watson trees this tree is locally
finite but for the other cases the random limit has exactly one node of
infinite degree.
  The proofs use a well-known connection to a random allocation model that we
call balls-in-boxes, and we prove corresponding theorems for this model.
  This survey paper contains many known results from many different sources,
together with some new results.
