Constraints of the osp(6|4) symmetry on tree-level scattering amplitudes in
N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory are derived. Supplemented by Feynman
diagram calculations, solutions to these constraints, namely the four- and
six-point superamplitudes, are presented and shown to be invariant under
Yangian symmetry. This introduces integrability into the amplitude sector of
the theory.
