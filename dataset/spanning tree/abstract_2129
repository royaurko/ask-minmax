A tree-based dictionary learning model is developed for joint analysis of
imagery and associated text. The dictionary learning may be applied directly to
the imagery from patches, or to general feature vectors extracted from patches
or superpixels (using any existing method for image feature extraction). Each
image is associated with a path through the tree (from root to a leaf), and
each of the multiple patches in a given image is associated with one node in
that path. Nodes near the tree root are shared between multiple paths,
representing image characteristics that are common among different types of
images. Moving toward the leaves, nodes become specialized, representing
details in image classes. If available, words (text) are also jointly modeled,
with a path-dependent probability over words. The tree structure is inferred
via a nested Dirichlet process, and a retrospective stick-breaking sampler is
used to infer the tree depth and width.
