Dinits-Karzanov-Lomonosov showed that it is possible to encode all minimal
edge cuts of a graph by a tree-like structure called a cactus. We show here
that minimal edge cuts separating ends of the graph rather than vertices can be
`encoded' also by a cactus. We apply our methods to finite graphs as well and
we show that several types of cuts can be encoded by cacti.
