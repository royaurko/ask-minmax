The Recapitulation of Web service is an approach for the effective
integration of distributed, heterogeneous and autonomous applications to build
more Structured and value added services. Web services selection algorithms are
required to find and select the best services. A QoS is a benchmark to select
the best service for the task of composition. The importance of the web
services selection algorithm is to maximize the QoS of the web services
recapitulation using complex service provider's (CSP) QoS requirement
parameters. This paper have discussed about different Web service
Service-offers. We have classified the CSP's requirements defined on the QoS
and Service-offers based on its structure. We have proposed a tree structure to
represent the CSP's requirement to be defined based on the multiple QoS
properties.
