To a rational homology sphere graph manifold one can associate a weighted
tree invariant called splice diagram. It was shown earlier that the splice
diagram determines the universal abelian cover of the manifold. We will in this
article turn the proof of this in to an algorithm to explicitly construct the
universal abelian cover from the splice diagram.
