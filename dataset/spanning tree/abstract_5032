We investigate the size distribution of the maximum areas and the
instantaneous distribution of areas of sunspot groups using the Greenwich
sunspot group record spanning the interval 1874-1976. Both distributions are
found to be well described by log-normal functions. Using a simple model we can
transform the maximum area distribution into the instantaneous area
distribution if the sunspot area decay rates are also distributed log-normally.
For single-valued decay rates the resulting snapshot distribution is
incompatible with the observations. The current analysis therefore supports the
results of Howard (1992) and MartinezPillet (1993). It is not possible to
distinguish between a linear and a quadratic decay law, however, with the
employed data set.
