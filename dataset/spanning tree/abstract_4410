We consider the dimensional regularization of the light-cone gauge type II
superstring field theories in the NSR formalism. In the previous work, we have
calculated the tree-level amplitudes with external lines in the (NS,NS) sector
using the regularization and shown that the desired results are obtained
without introducing contact term interactions. In this work, we study the
tree-level amplitudes with external lines in the Ramond sector. In order to
deal with them, we propose a worldsheet theory to be used instead of that for
the naive dimensional regularization. With the worldsheet theory, we regularize
and define the tree-level amplitudes by analytic continuation. We show that the
results coincide with those of the first quantized formulation.
