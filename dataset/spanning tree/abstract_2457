A phylogenetic tree is a way to organize a finite set of species, individuals
or other sources of related data. The species for which we have existing DNA
data make up the set of leaves of the tree. The balanced minimal evolution
method of creating phylogenetic trees can be formulated as a linear programming
problem, minimizing an inner product over the vertices of the BME polytope. In
this paper we undertake the first steps of describing the facets of this
polytope.
