We prove that longest common prefix (LCP) information can be stored in much
less space than previously known. More precisely, we show that in the presence
of the text and the suffix array, o(n) additional bits are sufficient to answer
LCP-queries asymptotically in the same time that is needed to retrieve an entry
from the suffix array. This yields the smallest compressed suffix tree with
sub-logarithmic navigation time.
