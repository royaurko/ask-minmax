We review generalized unitarity as a means for obtaining loop amplitudes from
on-shell tree amplitudes. The method is generally applicable to both
supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric amplitudes, including non-planar
contributions. Here we focus mainly on N=4 Yang-Mills theory, in the context of
on-shell superspaces. Given the need for regularization at loop level, we also
review a six-dimensional helicity-based superspace formalism and its
application to dimensional and massive regularizations. An important feature of
the unitarity method is that it offers a means for carrying over any identified
tree-level property of on-shell amplitudes to loop level, though sometimes in a
modified form. We illustrate this with examples of dual conformal symmetry and
a recently discovered duality between color and kinematics.
