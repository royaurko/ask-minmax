In this work we study a new equivalence relation between w* closed algebras
of operators on Hilbert spaces. The algebras A and B are called TRO equivalent
if there exists a ternary ring of operators M (i.e. MM*M\subset M) such that A
is the w*-closed span of M*BM and B is the w*-closed span of MAM*. We prove
that two reflexive algebras are TRO equivalent if and only if there exists a *
isomorphism between the commutants of their diagonals mapping the invariant
projection lattice of the first algebra onto the lattice of the second one. We
explore some consequences of TRO equivalence for CSL algebras. We also prove
that TRO equivalence is stronger than "spatial Morita equivalence". Two CSL
algebras are "spatially Morita equivalent" if and only if their lattices are
isomorphic. In this case if one of them is synthetic then so is the other.
