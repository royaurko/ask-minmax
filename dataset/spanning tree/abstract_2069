Diversification is nested, and early models suggested this could lead to a
great deal of evolutionary redundancy in the Tree of Life. This result is based
on a particular set of branch lengths produced by the common coalescent, where
pendant branches leading to tips can be very short compared to branches deeper
in the tree. Here, we analyze alternative and more realistic Yule and
birth-death models. We show how censoring at the present both makes average
branches one half what we might expect and makes pendant and interior branches
roughly equal in length. Although dependent on whether we condition on the size
of the tree, its age, or both, these results hold both for the Yule model and
for birth-death models with moderate extinction. Importantly, the rough
equivalency in interior and exterior branch lengths means the loss of
evolutionary history with loss of species can be roughly linear. Under these
models, the Tree of Life may offer limited redundancy in the face of ongoing
species loss.
