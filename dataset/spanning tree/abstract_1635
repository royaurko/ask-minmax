We study maximal clades in random phylogenetic trees with the Yule-Harding
model or, equivalently, in binary search trees. We use probabilistic methods to
reprove and extend earlier results on moment asymptotics and asymptotic
normality. In particular, we give an explanation of the curious phenomenon
observed by Drmota, Fuchs and Lee (2014) that asymptotic normality holds, but
one should normalize using half the variance.
