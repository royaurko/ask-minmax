The relationship between two important problems in tree pattern matching, the
largest common subtree and the smallest common supertree problems, is
established by means of simple constructions, which allow one to obtain a
largest common subtree of two trees from a smallest common supertree of them,
and vice versa. These constructions are the same for isomorphic, homeomorphic,
topological, and minor embeddings, they take only time linear in the size of
the trees, and they turn out to have a clear algebraic meaning.
