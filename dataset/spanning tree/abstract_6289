Some time ago the bosonic and fermionic 4-field terms of the non-abelian low
energy effective action of the open superstring were obtained, to all order in
$\alpha'$. This was done at tree level by directly generalizing the abelian
case, treated some time before, and considering the known expressions of all
massless superstring 4-point amplitudes (at tree level). In the present work we
obtain the bosonic 5-field terms of this effective action, to all order in
$\alpha'$. This is done by considering the simplified expression of the
superstring 5-point amplitude for massless bosons, obtained some time ago.
