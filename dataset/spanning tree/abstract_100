A method to obtain all possible graceful spanning trees in a complete graph
is proposed. An algorithm to generate all the labeled spanning trees in a
complete graph is developed and modified to generate all graceful spanning
trees. The count of all possible graceful graphs in a complete graph is
obtained. An upper bound on the count of gracefully labeled trees in a complete
graph is obtained. We settle Graceful Tree Conjecture in the affirmative in two
ways: 1) We show that all trees can be gracefully labeled by assigning the
lowest label 1 to the so called special vertices of trees, i.e. prependant
vertices or pendant vertices adjacent to prependant vertices. 2) We establish
the existence of graceful labeling for all trees by associating distinct
lattice paths with trees and by showing the existence of a lattice path for a
tree of each isomorphism type by showing how to construct a lattice path
recursively by starting from the lattice path for its pendant vertex deleted
subtree, which is assumed to exists by induction, and carrying out appropriate
modification of this lattice path. 3) We propose a crisp algorithm to
gracefully label tree of every isomorphism type with the help of novel
representation for any tree in terms of juxtaposition of paths. Lastly, we
discuss an algorithm to find arbitrarily degree constrained graceful spanning
tree and propose some problems for further investigation.
