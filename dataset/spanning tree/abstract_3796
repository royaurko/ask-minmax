We introduce a fully written programmed code with a supervised method for
generating Steiner trees. Our choice of the programming language, and the use
of well-known theorems from Geometry and Complex Analysis, allowed this method
to be implemented with only 747 lines of effective source code. This eases the
understanding and the handling of this beta version for future developments.
