This paper examines the former location-based social medium Brightkite, over
its three-year life span, based on the concept of natural cities. The term
'natural cities' refers to spatially clustered geographic events, such as the
agglomerated patches aggregated from individual social media users' locations.
We applied the head/tail division rule to derive natural cities, based on the
fact that there are far more low-density locations than high-density locations
on the earth surface. More specifically, we generated a triangulated irregular
network, made up of individual unique user locations, and then categorized
small triangles (smaller than an average) as natural cities for the United
States (mainland) on a monthly basis. The concept of natural cities provides a
powerful means to develop new insights into the evolution of real cities,
because there are virtually no data available to track the history of cities
across their entire life spans and at very fine spatial and temporal scales.
Therefore, natural cities can act as a good proxy of real cities, in the sense
of understanding underlying interactions, at a global level, rather than of
predicting cities, at an individual level. Apart from the data produced and the
contributed methods, we established new insights into the structure and
dynamics of natural cities, e.g., the idea that natural cities evolve in
nonlinear manners at both spatial and temporal dimensions.
