We propose an action for gravity on a fuzzy sphere, based on a matrix model.
We find striking similarities with an analogous model of two dimensional
gravity on a noncommutative plane, i.e. the solution space of both models is
spanned by pure U(2) gauge transformations acting on the background solution of
the matrix model, and there exist deformations of the classical diffeomorphisms
which preserve the two-dimensional noncommutative gravity actions.
