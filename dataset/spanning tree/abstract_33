We prove a Matrix-Tree Theorem enumerating the spanning trees of a cell
complex in terms of the eigenvalues of its cellular Laplacian operators,
generalizing a previous result for simplicial complexes. As an application, we
obtain explicit formulas for spanning tree enumerators and Laplacian
eigenvalues of cubes; the latter are integers. We prove a weighted version of
the eigenvalue formula, providing evidence for a conjecture on weighted
enumeration of cubical spanning trees. We introduce a cubical analogue of
shiftedness, and obtain a recursive formula for the Laplacian eigenvalues of
shifted cubical complexes, in particular, these eigenvalues are also integers.
Finally, we recover Adin's enumeration of spanning trees of a complete colorful
simplicial complex from the cellular Matrix-Tree Theorem together with a result
of Kook, Reiner and Stanton.
