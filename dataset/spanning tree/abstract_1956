A number of hook formulas and hook summation formulas have previously
appeared, involving various classes of trees. One of these classes of trees is
rooted trees with labelled vertices, in which the labels increase along every
chain from the root vertex to a leaf. In this paper we give a new hook
summation formula for these (unordered increasing) trees, by introducing a new
set of indeterminates indexed by pairs of vertices, that we call edge weights.
This new result generalizes a previous result by F\'eray and Goulden, that
arose in the context of representations of the symmetric group via the study of
Kerov's character polynomials. Our proof is by means of a combinatorial
bijection that is a generalization of the Pr\"ufer code for labelled trees.
