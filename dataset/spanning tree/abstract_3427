We find a large CP violation effect within the Two-Higgs-Doublet-Model for
the reaction $e^+e^-\to t\bar{t}H^0$ at future linear colliders. The
CP-asymmetry arises already at the tree level as a result of interference
between diagrams with $H^0$ emission from $t$ (and $\bar{t}$) and its emission
from a $Z^0$ and can be about 10--20\%. In the best case one needs a few
hundred $t\bar{t}H^0$ events to observe CP violation at the 3$\sigma$ level.
