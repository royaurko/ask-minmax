We empirically investigated the effects of market factors on the information
flow created from N(N-1)/2 linkage relationships among stocks. We also examined
the possibility of employing the minimal spanning tree (MST) method, which is
capable of reducing the number of links to N-1. We determined that market
factors carry important information value regarding information flow among
stocks. Moreover, the information flow among stocks evidenced time-varying
properties according to the changes in market status. In particular, we noted
that the information flow increased dramatically during periods of market
crises. Finally, we confirmed, via the MST method, that the information flow
among stocks could be assessed effectively with the reduced linkage
relationships among all links between stocks from the perspective of the
overall market.
