We prove some asymptotic results for the radius and the profile of large
random bipartite planar maps. Using a bijection due to Bouttier, Di Francesco
and Guitter between rooted bipartite planar maps and certain two-type trees
with positive labels, we derive our results from a conditional limit theorem
for two-type spatial trees. Finally we apply our estimates to separating
vertices of bipartite planar maps: with probability close to one when $n$ goes
to infinity, a random $2\ka$-angulation with $n$ faces has a separating vertex
whose removal disconnects the map into two components each with size greater
that $n^{1/2-\vep}$.
