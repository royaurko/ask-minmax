We use a collection of Python programs for numerical simulation of liver
perfusion. We have an application for semi-automatic generation of a finite
element mesh of the human liver from computed tomography scans and for
reconstruction of the liver vascular structure. When the real vascular trees
can not be obtained from the CT data we generate artificial trees using the
constructive optimization method. The generated FE mesh and vascular trees are
imported into SfePy (Simple Finite Elements in Python) and numerical
simulations are performed in order to get the pressure distribution and
perfusion flows in the liver tissue. In the post-processing steps we calculate
transport of a contrast fluid through the liver parenchyma.
