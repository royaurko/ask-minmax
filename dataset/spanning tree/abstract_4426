We study asymptotic properties of diffusion and other transport processes
(including self-avoiding walks and electrical conduction) on large randomly
branched polymers using renormalized dynamical field theory. We focus on the
swollen phase and the collapse transition, where loops in the polymers are
irrelevant. Here the asymptotic statistics of the polymers is that of lattice
trees, and diffusion on them is reminiscent of the climbing of a monkey on a
tree. We calculate a set of universal scaling exponents including the diffusion
exponent and the fractal dimension of the minimal path to 2-loop order and,
where available, compare them to numerical results.
