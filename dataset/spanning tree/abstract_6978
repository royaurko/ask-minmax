This paper describes the xSAP safety analysis platform. xSAP provides several
model-based safety analysis features for finite- and infinite-state synchronous
transition systems. In particular, it supports library-based definition of
fault modes, an automatic model extension facility, generation of safety
analysis artifacts such as Dynamic Fault Trees (DFTs) and Failure Mode and
Effects Analysis (FMEA) tables. Moreover, it supports probabilistic evaluation
of Fault Trees, failure propagation analysis using Timed Failure Propagation
Graphs (TFPGs), and Common Cause Analysis (CCA). xSAP has been used in several
industrial projects as verification back-end, and is currently being evaluated
in a joint R&D Project involving FBK and The Boeing Company.
