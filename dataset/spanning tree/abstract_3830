We investigate exact crossing minimization for graphs that differ from trees
by a small number of additional edges, for several variants of the crossing
minimization problem. In particular, we provide fixed parameter tractable
algorithms for the 1-page book crossing number, the 2-page book crossing
number, and the minimum number of crossed edges in 1-page and 2-page book
drawings.
