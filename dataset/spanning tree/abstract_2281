A central limit theorem for binary tree is numerically examined. Two types of
central limit theorem for higher-order branches are formulated. A topological
structure of a binary tree is expressed by a binary sequence, and the
Horton-Strahler indices are calculated by using the sequence. By fitting the
Gaussian distribution function to our numerical data, the values of variances
are determined and written in simple forms.
