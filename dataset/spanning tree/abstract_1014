Since the seminal work of Howard and Newman \cite{HN01}, the straight
character of many geometric random trees has been put forward. In particular,
these trees admit semi-infinite branches in all the directions. In this paper,
we develop a general method ensuring that the mean number of these
semi-infinite branches is sublinear. Our method essentially relies on a local
approximation (in distribution) of the tree far away from its root by a
suitable directed forest and on the fact that this directed forest a.s. admits
only one topological end. We apply this method to three different models; the
Radial Poisson Tree, the Euclidean FPP Tree (see \cite{HN01}) and the Dirested
LPP Tree (see \cite{Martin06}).
