In traditional massive content distribution with multiple sessions, the
sessions form separate overlay networks and operate independently, where some
sessions may suffer from insufficient resources even though other sessions have
excessive resources. To cope with this problem, we consider the universal
swarming approach, which allows multiple sessions to cooperate with each other.
We formulate the problem of finding the optimal resource allocation to maximize
the sum of the session utilities and present a subgradient algorithm which
converges to the optimal solution in the time-average sense. The solution
involves an NP-hard subproblem of finding a minimum-cost Steiner tree. We cope
with this difficulty by using a column generation method, which reduces the
number of Steiner-tree computations. Furthermore, we allow the use of
approximate solutions to the Steiner-tree subproblem. We show that the
approximation ratio to the overall problem turns out to be no less than the
reciprocal of the approximation ratio to the Steiner-tree subproblem.
Simulation results demonstrate that universal swarming improves the performance
of resource-poor sessions with negligible impact to resource-rich sessions. The
proposed approach and algorithm are expected to be useful for
infrastructure-based content distribution networks with long-lasting sessions
and relatively stable network environment.
