Random tensor models are generalizations of matrix models which also support
a 1/N expansion. The dominant observables are in correspondence with some
trees, namely rooted trees with vertices of degree at most $D$ and lines
colored by a number $i$ from 1 to $D$ such that no two lines connecting a
vertex to its descendants have the same color. In this Letter we study by
independent methods a generating function for these observables. We prove that
the number of such trees with exactly $p_i$ lines of color $i$ is
$\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^D p_i +1} \binom{\sum_{i=1}^D p_i+1}{p_1} ...
\binom{\sum_{i=1}^D p_i+1}{p_D}$.
