We consider electroweak symmetry breaking by a certain class of non-local
Higgs sectors. Extending previous studies employing the Mandelstam condition, a
straight Wilson line is used to make the Higgs action gauge invariant. We show
the unitarization of vector-boson scattering for a wide class of non-local
actions, but find that the Wilson-line model leads to tree-level corrections to
electroweak precision observables, which restrict the parameter space of the
model. We also find that Unhiggs models cannot address the hierarchy problem,
once the parameters are expressed in terms of low-energy observables.
