We study a generalization of the well known bottleneck spanning tree problem
called "Best Case Connectivity with Uncertainty": Given a family of geometric
regions, choose one point per region, such that the length of the longest edge
in a spanning tree of a disc intersection graph is minimized. We show that this
problem is NP-hard even for very simple scenarios such as line segments and
squares. We also give exact and approximation algorithms for the case of line
segments and unit discs respectively.
