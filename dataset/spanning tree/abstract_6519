This is the 6th paper in the series developing the formalism to manage the
effective scattering theory of strong interactions. Relying on the theoretical
scheme suggested in our previous publications we concentrate here on the
practical aspect and apply our technique to the elastic pion-nucleon scattering
amplitude. We test numerically the pion-nucleon spectrum sum rules that follow
from the tree level bootstrap constraints. We show how these constraints can be
used to estimate the tensor and vector $NN\rho$ coupling constants. At last, we
demonstrate that the tree-level low energy expansion coefficients computed in
the framework of our approach show nice agreement with known experimental data.
These results allow us to claim that the extended perturbation scheme is quite
reasonable from the computational point of view.
