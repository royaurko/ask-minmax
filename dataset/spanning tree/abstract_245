We prove that finding a rooted subtree with at least $k$ leaves in a digraph
is a fixed parameter tractable problem. A similar result holds for finding
rooted spanning trees with many leaves in digraphs from a wide family $\cal L$
that includes all strong and acyclic digraphs. This settles completely an open
question of Fellows and solves another one for digraphs in $\cal L$. Our
algorithms are based on the following combinatorial result which can be viewed
as a generalization of many results for a `spanning tree with many leaves' in
the undirected case, and which is interesting on its own: If a digraph $D\in
\cal L$ of order $n$ with minimum in-degree at least 3 contains a rooted
spanning tree, then $D$ contains one with at least $(n/2)^{1/5}-1$ leaves.
