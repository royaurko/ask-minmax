Under fairly general assumptions, we prove a joint large deviation principles
in $n$ for the empirical pair measure and empirical offspring measure of
critical multitype Galton-Watson trees conditioned to have exactly $n$ vertices
in the weak topology. From these results we obtain a large deviation principle
for the empirical pair measures of Markov chains indexed by simply generated
trees obtained by conditioning critical Galton-Watson trees on the total number
of vertices. For the case where the offspring law of the tree is a geometric
distribution with parameter $\sfrac{1}{2}$, we get an exact rate function. All
our rate functions are expressed in terms of relative entropies.
