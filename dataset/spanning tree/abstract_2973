The alpha model, a parametrized family of probabilities on cladograms (rooted
binary leaf labeled trees), is introduced. This model is Markovian
self-similar, deletion-stable (sampling consistent), and passes through the
Yule, Uniform and Comb models. An explicit formula is given to calculate the
probability of any cladogram or tree shape under the alpha model. Sackin's and
Colless' index are shown to be $O(n^{1+\alpha})$ with asymptotic covariance
equal to 1. Thus the expected depth of a random leaf with $n$ leaves is
$O(n^\alpha)$. The number of cherries on a random alpha tree is shown to be
asymptotically normal with known mean and variance. Finally the shape of
published phylogenies is examined, using trees from Treebase.
