We consider random dynamics on a uniform random recursive tree with $n$
vertices. Successively, in a uniform random order, each edge is either set on
fire with some probability $p_n$ or fireproof with probability $1-p_n$. Fires
propagate in the tree and are only stopped by fireproof edges. We first
consider the proportion of burnt and fireproof vertices as $n\to\infty$, and
prove a phase transition when $p_n$ is of order $\ln n/n$. We then study the
connectivity of the fireproof forest, more precisely the existence of a giant
component. We finally investigate the sizes of the burnt subtrees.
