Fischer has shown how to compute a minimum weight spanning tree of degree at
most $b \Delta^* + \lceil \log\_b n\rceil$ in time $O(n^{4 + 1/\ln b})$ for any
constant $b > 1$, where $\Delta^*$ is the value of an optimal solution and $n$
is the number of nodes in the network. In this paper, we propose a distributed
version of Fischer's algorithm that requires messages and time complexity
$O(n^{2 + 1/\ln b})$, and O(n) space per node.
