Let $S$ and $T$ be hyperbolic endomorphisms of $\mathbb{T}^d$ with the
property that the span of the subspace contracted by $S$ along with the
subspace contracted by $T$ is $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that the Hausdorff
dimension of the intersection of the set of points with equidistributing orbits
under $S$ with the set of points with nondense orbit under $T$ is full. In the
case that $S$ and $T$ are quasihyperbolic automorphisms, we prove that the
Hausdorff dimension of the intersection is again full when we assume that
$\mathbb{R}^d$ is spanned by the subspaces contracted by $S$ and $T$ along with
the central eigenspaces of $S$ and $T$.
