Using unitarity methods, we compute, for several massive two-dimensional
models, the cut-constructible part of the one-loop 2->2 scattering S-matrices
from the tree-level amplitudes. We apply our method to various integrable
theories, finding evidence that for supersymmetric models the one-loop S-matrix
is cut-constructible, while for models without supersymmetry (but with
integrability) the missing rational terms are proportional to the tree-level
S-matrix and therefore can be interpreted as a shift in the coupling. Finally,
applying our procedure to the world-sheet theory for the light-cone gauge-fixed
AdS_5 x S^5 superstring we reproduce, at one-loop in the near-BMN expansion,
the S-matrix known from integrability techniques.
