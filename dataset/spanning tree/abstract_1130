Ground Tree Rewrite Systems with State are known to have an undecidable
control state reachability problem. Taking inspiration from the recent
introduction of scope-bounded multi-stack pushdown systems, we define Senescent
Ground Tree Rewrite Systems. These are a restriction of ground tree rewrite
systems with state such that nodes of the tree may no longer be rewritten after
having witnessed an a priori fixed number of control state changes. As well as
generalising scope-bounded multi-stack pushdown systems, we show --- via
reductions to and from reset Petri-nets --- that these systems have an
Ackermann-complete control state reachability problem. However, reachability of
a regular set of trees remains undecidable.
