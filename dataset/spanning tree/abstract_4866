Two kinds of approximation algorithms exist for the k-BALANCED PARTITIONING
problem: those that are fast but compute unsatisfying approximation ratios, and
those that guarantee high quality ratios but are slow. In this paper we prove
that this tradeoff between runtime and solution quality is necessary. For the
problem a minimum number of edges in a graph need to be found that, when cut,
partition the vertices into k equal-sized sets. We develop a reduction
framework which identifies some necessary conditions on the considered graph
class in order to prove the hardness of the problem. We focus on two
combinatorially simple but very different classes, namely trees and solid grid
graphs. The latter are finite connected subgraphs of the infinite 2D grid
without holes. First we use the framework to show that for solid grid graphs it
is NP-hard to approximate the optimum number of cut edges within any satisfying
ratio. Then we consider solutions in which the sets may deviate from being
equal-sized. Our framework is used on grids and trees to prove that no fully
polynomial time algorithm exists that computes solutions in which the sets are
arbitrarily close to equal-sized. This is true even if the number of edges cut
is allowed to increase the more stringent the limit on the set sizes is. These
are the first bicriteria inapproximability results for the problem.
