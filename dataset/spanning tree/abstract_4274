In this paper, we study the tree amplitudes with gluons coupled to gravitons.
We first study the relations among the mixed amplitudes. With BCFW on-shell
recursion relation, we will show the color-order reversed relation,
$U(1)$-decoupling relation and KK relation hold for tree amplitudes with gluons
coupled to gravitons. We then study the disk relation which expresses mixed
amplitudes by pure gluon amplitudes. More specifically we will prove the disk
relation for mixed amplitudes with gluons coupled to one graviton. Using the
disk relation and the properties of pure gluon amplitudes, the color-order
reversed relation, $U(1)$-decoupling relation and KK relation for mixed
amplitudes can also be proved. Finally, we give some brief discussions on
BCJ-like relation for mixed amplitudes.
