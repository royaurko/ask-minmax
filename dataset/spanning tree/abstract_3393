The fractal structures of a green broccoli and a white cauliflower are
investigated by box-counting method of their cross-sections. The capacity
dimensions of the cross-sections are $1.78 \pm 0.02$ for a green broccoli and
$1.88 \pm 0.02$ for a white cauliflower, and both are independent of their
directions. From the results we predict that the capacity dimensions of the
bulks are about 2.7 for a green broccoli and $2.8.$ for a white cauliflower.
  The vertical cross-sections of the two plants are modeled into self-similar
sets of triangular and rectangular trees.
  We discuss the conditions of the fractal objects in the model trees.
