We have examined the spatial distribution of 856 AGN detected by the ROSAT
All-Sky Survey (RASS) using a direct search for structures with the minimal
spanning tree. The AGNs were compiled from an area of 7000 deg^2, in which
optical identifications of RASS sources were made with the help of the
digitized objective prism plates of the Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS). Redshifts
were taken from the literature or from own follow-up observations. The sample
probes the spatial distribution at low redshifts, since the redshift
distribution peaks at z=0.1. The application of the minimal spanning tree led
to a 1.8 sigma discovery of an AGN group with 7 members in a volume V=140*75*75
h^-3Mpc^3 in the Pisces constellation. With a mean redshift z=0.27 this group
is only the third discovered group at redshifts z<0.5. The RASS offers
excellent possibilities to study large scale structure with AGNs at low
redshifts, once these redshifts are determined.
