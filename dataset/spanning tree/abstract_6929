A 1989 result of Duarte asserts that for a given tree T on n vertices, a
fixed vertex i, and two sets of distinct real numbers L, M of sizes n and n-1,
respectively, such that M strictly interlaces L, there is a real symmetric
matrix A such that graph of A is T, eigenvalues of A are given by L, and
eigenvalues of A(i) are given by M. In 2013, a similar result for connected
graphs was published by Hassani Monfared and Shader, using the Jacobian method.
Analogues of these results are presented here for real skew-symmetric matrices
whose graphs belong to a certain family of trees, and all of their supergraphs.
