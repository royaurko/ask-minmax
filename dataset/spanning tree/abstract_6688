Consider the class of k-independent bond, respectively site, percolations
with parameter p on an infinite tree T. We derive tight bounds on p for both
a.s. percolation and a.s. nonpercolation. The bounds are continuous functions
of k and the branching number of T. This extends previous results by Lyons for
the independent case (k=0) and by Bollob\`as & Balister for 1-independent bond
percolations. Central to our argumentation are moment method bounds \`a la
Lyons supplemented by explicit percolation models \`a la Bollob\`as & Balister.
An indispensable tool is the minimality and explicit construction of Shearer's
measure on the k-fuzz of Z.
