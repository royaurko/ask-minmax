We study decay of unstable D-branes in string theory in the presence of
electric field, and show that the classical open string theory results for
various properties of the final state agree with the properties of closed
string states into which the system is expected to decay. This suggests a
duality between tree level open string theory on unstable D-branes and closed
strings at high density.
