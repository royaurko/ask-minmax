The m-Tamari lattice of F. Bergeron is an analogue of the clasical Tamari
order defined on objects counted by Fuss-Catalan numbers, such as m-Dyck paths
or (m+1)-ary trees. On another hand, the Tamari order is related to the product
in the Loday-Ronco Hopf algebra of planar binary trees. We introduce new
combinatorial Hopf algebras based on (m+1)-ary trees, whose structure is
described by the m-Tamari lattices.
  In the same way as planar binary trees can be interpreted as sylvester
classes of permutations, we obtain (m+1)-ary trees as sylvester classes of what
we call m-permutations. These objects are no longer in bijection with
decreasing (m+1)-ary trees, and a finer congruence, called metasylvester,
allows us to build Hopf algebras based on these decreasing trees. At the
opposite, a coarser congruence, called hyposylvester, leads to Hopf algebras of
graded dimensions (m+1)^{n-1}, generalizing noncommutative symmetric functions
and quasi-symmetric functions in a natural way. Finally, the algebras of packed
words and parking functions also admit such m-analogues, and we present their
subalgebras and quotients induced by the various congruences.
