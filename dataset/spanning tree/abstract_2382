We consider the Neumann Sturm-Liouville problem defined on trees such that
the ratios of lengths of edges are not necessarily rational. It is shown that
the potential function of the Sturm-Liouville operator must be zero if the
spectrum is equal to that for zero potential. This extends previous results and
gives an Ambarzumyan theorem for the Neumann Sturm-Liouville problem on trees.
To prove this, we compute approximated eigenvalues for zero potential by using
a generalized pigeon hole argument, and make use of recursive formulas for
characteristic functions.
