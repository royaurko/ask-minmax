The paper establishes a weak version of Horton self-similarity for a tree
representation of Kingman's coalescent process. The proof is based on a
Smoluchowski-type system of ordinary differential equations for the number of
branches of a given Horton-Strahler order in a tree that represents Kingman's
N-coalescent process with a constant kernel, in a hydrodynamic limit. We also
demonstrate a close connection between the combinatorial Kingman's tree and the
combinatorial level set tree of a white noise, which implies Horton
self-similarity for the latter.
