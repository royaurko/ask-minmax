The radio galaxy 3C 84 is a representative of gamma-ray-bright misaligned
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and one of the best laboratories to study the
radio properties of the sub-pc jet in connection with the gamma-ray emission.
In order to identify possible radio counterparts of the gamma-ray emissions in
3C 84, we study the change in structure within the central 1 pc and the light
curve of sub-pc-size components C1, C2, and C3. We search for any correlation
between changes in the radio components and the gamma-ray flares by making use
of VLBI and single dish data. Throughout the radio monitoring spanning over two
GeV gamma-ray flares detected by the {\it Fermi}-LAT and the MAGIC Cherenkov
Telescope in the periods of 2009 April to May and 2010 June to August, total
flux density in radio band increases on average. This flux increase mostly
originates in C3. Although the gamma-ray flares span on the timescale of days
to weeks, no clear correlation with the radio light curve on this timescale is
found. Any new prominent components and change in morphology associated with
the gamma-ray flares are not found on the VLBI images.
