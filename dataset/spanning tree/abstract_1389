This paper investigates some properties of the number of subtrees of a tree
with given degree sequence. These results are used to characterize trees with
the given degree sequence that have the largest number of subtrees, which
generalizes the recent results of Kirk and Wang. These trees coincide with
those which were proven by Wang and independently Zhang et al. to minimize the
Wiener index. We also provide a partial ordering of the extremal trees with
different degree sequences, some extremal results follow as corollaries.
