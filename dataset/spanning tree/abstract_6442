It is becoming increasingly clear that metastable vacua may play a prominent
role in supersymmetry-breaking. To date, however, this idea has been realized
only in models where non-perturbative dynamics complicates the analysis of
metastability. In this paper, we present a simple construction in which
metastable vacua occur classically, i.e., at tree-level, and in which
supersymmetry-breaking is sourced by both D-terms and F-terms. All relevant
dynamics is perturbative, and hence calculations of vacuum energies and
lifetimes can be performed explicitly. Moreover, we find that our construction
can even give rise to multiple non-supersymmetric vacua which are degenerate.
The non-trivial vacuum structure of such models therefore suggests that they
can provide a rich arena for future studies of vacuum metastability in
supersymmetric field theories. Our results may also have important consequences
for Z' phenomenology and the string landscape.
