We calculate the chirally improved (CI) Landau gauge quark propagator in two
flavor lattice Quantum Chromodynamics and study thereon the effects of Dirac
low-mode removal. The application of tree-level improvement of the propagator
and tree-level correction of the lattice dressing functions removes the leading
discretization artifacts. We find the dynamically generated mass in the
infrared domain of the mass function to dissolve continuously with the
reduction level and furthermore we observe strong suppression of the
wave-function renormalization function for small momenta.
