Cluster analysis is one of the primary data analysis technique in data mining
and K-means is one of the commonly used partitioning clustering algorithm. In
K-means algorithm, resulting set of clusters depend on the choice of initial
centroids. If we can find initial centroids which are coherent with the
arrangement of data, the better set of clusters can be obtained. This paper
proposes a method based on the Dissimilarity Tree to find, the better initial
centroid as well as every bit more accurate cluster with less computational
time. Theory analysis and experimental results indicate that the proposed
method can effectively improve the accuracy of clusters and reduce the
computational complexity of the K-means algorithm.
