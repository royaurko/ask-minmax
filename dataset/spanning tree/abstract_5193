The resonance production of $\Delta$, K(892), $\Sigma$(1385), $\Lambda$(1520)
and $\phi$ from elementary p+p and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $
200 GeV from the STAR experiment at RHIC is presented. Yields and spectra are
discussed in terms of chemical and thermal freeze-out conditions. Thermal
models do not describe sufficiently the yields of the resonance production in
central Au+Au collisions. The approach which includes pseudo-elastic and
elastic hadronic interactions after chemical freeze-out until thermal
freeze-out suggests a time span of $\Delta \tau>$5 fm/c.
