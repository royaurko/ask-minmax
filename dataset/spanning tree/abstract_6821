The \emph{domination subdivision number} sd$(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the
minimum number of edges that must be subdivided (where an edge can be
subdivided at most once) in order to increase the domination number of $G$. It
has been shown \cite{vel} that sd$(T)\leq 3$ for any tree $T$. We prove that
the decision problem of the domination subdivision number is NP-complete even
for bipartite graphs. For this reason we define the \emph{domination
multisubdivision number} of a nonempty graph $G$ as a minimum positive integer
$k$ such that there exists an edge which must be subdivided $k$ times to
increase the domination number of $G$. We show that msd$(G)\leq 3$ for any
graph $G$. The domination subdivision number and the domination
multisubdivision numer of a graph are incomparable in general case, but we show
that for trees these two parameters are equal. We also determine domination
multisubdivision number for some classes of graphs.
