We study the basic ergodic properties (ergodicity and conservativity) of the
action of an arbitrary subgroup $H$ of a free group $F$ on the boundary
$\partial F$ with respect to the uniform measure. Our approach is geometrical
and combinatorial, and it is based on choosing a system of Nielsen--Schreier
generators in $H$ associated with a geodesic spanning tree in the Schreier
graph $X=H\backslash F$. We give several (mod 0) equivalent descriptions of the
Hopf decomposition of the boundary into the conservative and the dissipative
parts. Further we relate conservativity and dissipativity of the action with
the growth of the Schreier graph $X$ and of the subgroup $H$ ($\equiv$ cogrowth
of $X$), respectively. We also construct numerous examples illustrating
connections between various relevant notions.
