Two graphs $G_1=(V,E_1)$ and $G_2=(V,E_2)$ admit a geometric simultaneous
embedding if there exists a set of points P and a bijection M: P -> V that
induce planar straight-line embeddings both for $G_1$ and for $G_2$. While it
is known that two caterpillars always admit a geometric simultaneous embedding
and that two trees not always admit one, the question about a tree and a path
is still open and is often regarded as the most prominent open problem in this
area. We answer this question in the negative by providing a counterexample.
Additionally, since the counterexample uses disjoint edge sets for the two
graphs, we also negatively answer another open question, that is, whether it is
possible to simultaneously embed two edge-disjoint trees. As a final result, we
study the same problem when some constraints on the tree are imposed. Namely,
we show that a tree of depth 2 and a path always admit a geometric simultaneous
embedding. In fact, such a strong constraint is not so far from closing the gap
with the instances not admitting any solution, as the tree used in our
counterexample has depth 4.
