Topological insulators host spin-polarized surface states which robustly span
the band gap and hold promise for novel applications. Recent theoretical
predictions have suggested that topologically protected surface states may
similarly span the hybridization gap in some strongly correlated heavy fermion
materials, particularly SmB6. However, the process by which the Sm 4f electrons
hybridize with the 5d electrons on the surface of SmB6, and the expected
Fermi-level gap in the density of states out of which the predicted topological
surface states must arise, have not been directly measured. We use scanning
tunneling microscopy to conduct the first atomic resolution spectroscopic study
of the cleaved surface of SmB6, and to reveal a robust hybridization gap which
universally spans the Fermi level on four distinct surface morphologies despite
shifts in the f band energy. Using a cotunneling model, we separate the density
of states of the hybridized bands from which the predicted topological surface
states must be disentangled. On all surfaces we observe residual spectral
weight spanning the hybridization gap down to the lowest T, which is consistent
with a topological surface state.
