We study the statistics of height and balanced height in the binary search
tree problem in computer science. The search tree problem is first mapped to a
fragmentation problem which is then further mapped to a modified directed
polymer problem on a Cayley tree. We employ the techniques of traveling fronts
to solve the polymer problem and translate back to derive exact asymptotic
properties in the original search tree problem. The second mapping allows us
not only to re-derive the already known results for random binary trees but to
obtain new exact results for search trees where the entries arrive according to
an arbitrary distribution, not necessarily randomly. Besides it allows us to
derive the asymptotic shape of the full probability distribution of height and
not just its moments. Our results are then generalized to $m$-ary search trees
with arbitrary distribution. An attempt has been made to make the article
accessible to both physicists and computer scientists.
