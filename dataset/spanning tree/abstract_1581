We consider a (random permutation model) binary search tree with n nodes and
give asymptotics on the loglog scale for the height H_n and saturation level
h_n of the tree as n\to\infty, both almost surely and in probability. We then
consider the number F_n of particles at level H_n at time n, and show that F_n
is unbounded almost surely.
