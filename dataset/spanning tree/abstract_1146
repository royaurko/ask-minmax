The classical matrix-tree theorem was discovered by G.~Kirchhoff in 1847. It
relates the principal minor of the Laplace (nxn)-matrix to a particular sum of
monomials indexed by the set of trees with n vertices. The aim of this paper is
to present a generalization of the (nonsymmetric) matrix-tree theorem
containing no trees and essentially no matrices. Instead of trees we consider
acyclic directed graphs with a prescribed set of sinks, and instead of
determinant, a polynomial invariant of the matrix determined by directed graph
such that any two vertices of the same connected component are mutually
reacheable.
