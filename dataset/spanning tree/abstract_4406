In the following paper we consider a simulation technique for stochastic
trees. One of the most important areas in computational genetics is the
calculation and subsequent maximization of the likelihood function associated
to such models. This typically consists of using importance sampling (IS) and
sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) techniques. The approach proceeds by simulating
the tree, backward in time from observed data, to a most recent common ancestor
(MRCA). However, in many cases, the computational time and variance of
estimators are often too high to make standard approaches useful. In this paper
we propose to stop the simulation, subsequently yielding biased estimates of
the likelihood surface. The bias is investigated from a theoretical point of
view. Results from simulation studies are also given to investigate the balance
between loss of accuracy, saving in computing time and variance reduction.
