The Steiner tree problem can be stated in terms of finding a connected set of
minimal length containing a given set of finitely many points. We show how to
formulate it as a mass-minimization problem for $1$-dimensional currents with
coefficients in a suitable normed group. The representation used for these
currents allows to state a calibration principle for this problem. We also
exhibit calibrations in some examples.
