We consider the task of optimizing the B-tree data structure, used
extensively in operating systems and databases, for sustainable usage on
multi-level flash memory. Empirical evidence shows that this new flash memory
tree, or FM Tree, extends the operational lifespan of each block of flash
memory by a factor of roughly 27 to 70 times, while still supporting
logarithmic-time search tree operations.
