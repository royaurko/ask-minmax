We iterate Manolescu's unoriented skein exact triangle in knot Floer homology
with coefficients in the field of rational functions over
$\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. The result is a spectral sequence which converges to
a stabilized version of delta-graded knot Floer homology. The $(E_2,d_2)$ page
of this spectral sequence is an algorithmically computable chain complex
expressed in terms of spanning trees, and we show that there are no higher
differentials. This gives the first combinatorial spanning tree model for knot
Floer homology.
