For a knot $K$, Kakimizu introduced a simplicial complex whose vertices are
all the isotopy classes of minimal genus spanning surfaces for $K$. The first
purpose of this paper is to prove the 1-skeleton of this complex has diameter
bounded by a function quadratic in knot genus, whenever $K$ is atoroidal. The
second purpose of this paper is to prove the intersection number of two minimal
genus spanning surfaces for $K$ is also bounded by a function quadratic in knot
genus, whenever $K$ is atoroidal. As one application, we prove the simple
connectivity of Kakimizu's complex among all atoroidal genus 1 knots.
