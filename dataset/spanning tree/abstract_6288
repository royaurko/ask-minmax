Using newly proposed BCF/BCFW recursion relations, compact formulas are
obtained for tree-level n-gluon amplitudes of helicity structure --++...+. We
then make an extension of these recursion relations to include fermions of
multi-flavors, from which MHV and \bar{MHV} amplitudes are reproduced. We also
calculate non-MHV amplitudes of processes with two fermions and four gluons.
Results thus obtained are equivalent to those obtained by extended CSW
prescriptions, and those by conventional field theory calculations.
