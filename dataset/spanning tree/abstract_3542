Accumulating observational evidence suggests an intimate connection between
rapidly expanding insect populations, deforestation, and global climate change.
We review the evidence, emphasizing the vulnerability of key planetary carbon
pools, especially the Earth's forests that link the micro-ecology of insect
infestation to climate. We survey current research regimes and insect control
strategies, concluding that at present they are insufficient to cope with the
problem's present regional scale and its likely future global scale. We propose
novel bioacoustic interactions between insects and trees as key drivers of
infestation population dynamics and the resulting wide-scale deforestation. The
bioacoustic mechanisms suggest new, nontoxic control interventions and
detection strategies.
