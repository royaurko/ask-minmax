Lookahead search is perhaps the most natural and widely used game playing
strategy. Given the practical importance of the method, the aim of this paper
is to provide a theoretical performance examination of lookahead search in a
wide variety of applications.
  To determine a strategy play using lookahead search}, each agent predicts
multiple levels of possible re-actions to her move (via the use of a search
tree), and then chooses the play that optimizes her future payoff accounting
for these re-actions. There are several choices of optimization function the
agents can choose, where the most appropriate choice of function will depend on
the specifics of the actual game - we illustrate this in our examples.
Furthermore, the type of search tree chosen by computationally-constrained
agent can vary. We focus on the case where agents can evaluate only a bounded
number, $k$, of moves into the future. That is, we use depth $k$ search trees
and call this approach {\em k-lookahead search}.
  We apply our method in five well-known settings: AdWord auctions; industrial
organization (Cournot's model); congestion games; valid-utility games and
basic-utility games; cost-sharing network design games. We consider two
questions. First, what is the expected social quality of outcome when agents
apply lookahead search? Second, what interactive behaviours can be exhibited
when players use lookahead search?
