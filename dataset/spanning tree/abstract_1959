The ability of trees to suck water from roots to leaves, sometimes to heights
of over a hundred meters, is remarkable given the absence of any mechanical
pump. This study deals with a number of issues, of both an historical and
conceptual nature, in the orthodox Cohesion Tension theory of the ascent of sap
in trees. The theory relies chiefly on the exceptional cohesive and adhesive
properties of water, the structural properties of trees, and the role of
evaporation (transpiration) from leaves. But it is not the whole story. Plant
scientists have been aware since the inception of the theory in the late 19th
century that further processes are at work in order to prime the trees, the
main such process (growth itself) being so obvious to them that it is often
omitted from the story. Other factors depend largely on the type of tree, and
are not always fully understood. For physicists, in particular, it may be
helpful to see the fuller picture, which is what this study attempts to provide
in nontechnical terms.
