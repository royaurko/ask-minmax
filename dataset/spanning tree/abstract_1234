A mutation will affect an individual and some or all of its descendants. In
this paper, we investigate ordered trees with a distinguished vertex called the
mutator. We describe various mutations in ordered trees, and find the
generating functions for statistics concerning trees with those mutations. The
examples give new interpretations to several known sequences and also introduce
many new sequences and their combinatorial interpretations.
