According to recent works [Tsui PSS \textbf{55}, 237-242 (2007); \textbf{55},
2042-2044 (2007)], the Neptune Adams ring main arc Fraternite is regarded as
captured by the corotation elliptic resonance (CER) potential of Galatea. The
minor arcs Egalite(2,1), Liberte, and Courage are located at positions where
the time averaged forces, due to the 42-43 corotation-Lindblad resonances under
the central field of Neptune, vanish. With adequately chosen Fraternite mass
and Galatea eccentricity, this model gives minor arc locations compatible to
observed positions, and allows a dynamic transport of materials among arcs. To
complement this model, the effect of self-gravity of Fraternite, with a
distributed mass, is evaluated together with the CER potential to account for
its $10^{0}$ longitudinal span. Although self-gravity is the collective action
of all the particles in the arc, each individual particle will see the
self-potential with a central maximum as an external potential generated by
other particles.
