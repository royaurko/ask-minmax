Valleyless sequences of finite length $n$ and maximum entry $k$ occur in tree
enumeration problems and provide an interesting correspondence between
permutations and compositions. In this paper we introduce the notion of \emph
{valleyless} sequences, explore the correspondence and enumerate them using the
method of generating functions.
