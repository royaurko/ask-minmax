We analyze the optical, UV, and X-ray microlensing variability of the lensed
quasar SDSS J0924+0219 using six epochs of Chandra data in two energy bands
(spanning 0.4-8.0 keV, or 1-20 keV in the quasar rest frame), 10 epochs of
F275W (rest-frame 1089A) Hubble Space Telescope data, and high-cadence R-band
(rest-frame 2770A) monitoring spanning eleven years. Our joint analysis
provides robust constraints on the extent of the X-ray continuum emission
region and the projected area of the accretion disk. The best-fit half-light
radius of the soft X-ray continuum emission region is between 5x10^13 and 10^15
cm, and we find an upper limit of 10^15 cm for the hard X-rays. The best-fit
soft-band size is about 13 times smaller than the optical size, and roughly 7
GM_BH/c^2 for a 2.8x10^8 M_sol black hole, similar to the results for other
systems. We find that the UV emitting region falls in between the optical and
X-ray emitting regions at 10^14 cm < r_1/2,UV < 3x10^15 cm. Finally, the
optical size is significantly larger, by 1.5*sigma, than the theoretical
thin-disk estimate based on the observed, magnification-corrected I-band flux,
suggesting a shallower temperature profile than expected for a standard disk.
