It is pointed out that models with condensates have nontrivial
renormalization group flow on the tree level. The infinitesimal form of the
tree level renormalization group equation is obtained and solved numerically
for the phi4 model in the symmetry broken phase. We find an attractive infrared
fixed point that eliminates the metastable region and reproduces the Maxwell
construction.
