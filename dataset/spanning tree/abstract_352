We give a structure theorem for Cohen Macaulay monomial ideals of codimension
2, and describe all possible relation matrices of such ideals. In case that the
ideal has a linear resolution, the relation matrices can be identified with the
spanning trees of a connected chordal graph with the property that each
distinct pair of maximal cliques of the graph has at most one vertex in common.
