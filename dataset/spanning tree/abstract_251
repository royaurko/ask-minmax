We study correlations of a set of stocks selected from both the New York and
London stock exchanges. Results are displayed using both Random Matrix Theory
approach and the graphical visualisation of the Minimal Spanning Tree. For the
set of stocks we study, cross correlations between markets do not mix the
markets significantly. Geographical differences seem to dominate the output of
a Random Matrix analysis. Only at the level of the third highest eigenvector do
we see an effect of New York on the London data with the emergence of some
common sectors with the larger eigenvectors in London and New York. The Minimal
Spanning Trees show the broad separation of the markets as reflected in the
second eigenvector of the Random Matrix analysis. However more detail is
difficult to discern from the Minimal Spanning Trees analysis.
