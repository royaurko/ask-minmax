The persistent pods of the tree, Acacia caven, that do not fall from the tree
provide opportunities for the appearance of a diverse group of insects the
following season. Such pods collected during the spring of 1999 in Chile were
indehiscent with highly sclerified pod walls. In contrast, persistent pods
collected in Uruguay after a wet winter and spring (2002) were partially
dehiscent, inducing the deterioration of the woody pods, and consequently
exposing the seeds. These persistent pods are a natural refuge for insect
species, namely two bruchid beetles (Pseudopachymeria spinipes, Stator
furcatus), one scolytidae (Dendroctonus sp), lepidopterous larvae, ant colonies
(Camponotus sp),one species of oophagous parasitoid (Uscana espinae group
senex), the gregarious larval-pupae parasitoid Monoksa dorsiplana
(Pteromalidae) and two species of Horismenus spp. (Eulophidae). The patriline
of M. dorsiplana is frequently formed by 1 son +7 daughters.
