The infrared features of Landau gauge QCD are studied by the lattice
simulation of $\beta=6.0, 16^4, 24^4, 32^4$ and $\beta=6.4, 32^4, 48^4$. We
adopt two definitions of the gauge field; 1) $U-$linear 2) $\log U$ and
measured the gluon propagator and ghost propagator. Infrared singularity of the
gluon propagator is less than that of tree level result but the gluon
propagator at 0 momentum remains finite. The infrared singularity of ghost
propagator is stronger than the tree level. The QCD running coupling measured
by using the gluon propagator and the ghost propagator has a maximum
$\alpha_s(p)\simeq 1$ at around $p=0.5GeV$ and decreases as $p$ approaches 0.
The data are analyzed in use of formula of the principle of minimal
sensitivity(PMS), the effective charge method and the contour-improved
perturbation method, which suggest necessity of the resummation of perturbation
series in the infrared region together with existence of the infrared fixed
point. Kugo-Ojima parameter saturates at about -0.8 in contrast to the
theoretically expected value -1.
