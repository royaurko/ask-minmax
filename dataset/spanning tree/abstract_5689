FormCalc is a Mathematica package for the automatic computation of tree-level
and one-loop Feynman amplitudes. It accepts diagrams generated by FeynArts,
simplifies them, and generates a complete Fortran code for their numerical
evaluation. Version 4 includes new features which enhance performance,
convenience of use, and modularity/code reusability.
