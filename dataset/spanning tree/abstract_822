In this paper, we extend the notion of tree language quotients to bottom-up
quotients. Instead of computing the residual of a tree language from top to
bottom and producing a list of tree languages, we show how to compute a set of
k-ary trees, where k is an arbitrary integer. We define the quotient formula
for different combinations of tree languages: union, symbol products,
compositions, iterated symbol products and iterated composition. These
computations lead to the definition of the bottom-up quotient tree automaton,
that turns out to be the minimal deterministic tree automaton associated with a
regular tree language in the case of the 0-ary trees.
