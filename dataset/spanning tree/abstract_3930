We study tree-level amplitudes of a colored scalar particle interacting with
an arbitrary number of gluons attached to the scalar worldline. We produce a
master formula generating all such amplitudes. It is obtained by considering
the worldline of a scalar particle with extra degrees of freedom needed to take
into account the color charge of the particle, which we choose to be in the
fundamental representation of the gauge group. Our worldline description
produces at the same time the case in which the particle sits in any
arbitrarily chosen symmetric or antisymmetric tensor product of the
fundamental.
