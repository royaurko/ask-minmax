I describe a class of groups acting on rooted trees that all have
intermediate word growth between polynomial and exponential. The argument
constructs a functional equation on the growth formal power series, and derives
the growth properties from its analytical behaviour. This places under a
unified proof all known or conjectured examples of such groups, and answers a
few open questions by Rostislav Grigorchuk.
