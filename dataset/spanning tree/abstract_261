Web 3.0 is an evolving extension of the web 2.0 scenario. The perceptions
regarding web 3.0 is different from person to person . Web 3.0 Architecture
supports ubiquitous connectivity, network computing, open identity, intelligent
web, distributed databases and intelligent applications. Some of the
technologies which lead to the design and development of web 3.0 applications
are Artificial intelligence, Automated reasoning, Cognitive architecture,
Semantic web . An attempt is made to capture the requirements of Students
inline with web 3.0 so as to bridge the gap between the design and development
of web 3.0 applications and requirements among Students. Maximum Spanning Tree
modeling of the requirements facilitate the identification of key areas and key
attributes in the design and development of software products for Students in
Web 3.0 using Discriminant analysis. Keywords : Web 3.0, Discriminant analysis,
