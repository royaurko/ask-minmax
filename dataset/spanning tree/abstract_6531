$\mu\nu$SSM is an $R$-parity violating non-minimal supersymmetric model which
uses right chiral neutrino superfields to solve the $\mu$-problem. The
$R$-parity violation together with a TeV scale seesaw mechanism using right
handed neutrinos are instrumental for the light neutrino mass generation in
$\mu\nu$SSM. We show that it is possible to accommodate three flavour global
neutrino data in $\mu\nu$SSM with three massive neutrinos at the tree level.
Ingression of the one-loop corrections to neutrino masses and mixing shows
certain variations over the tree level analysis depending on the specific
hierarchy of neutrino masses involved. In $\mu\nu$SSM some of the $R$-parity
violating decay branching ratios of the lightest neutralino show nice
correlation with certain neutrino mixing angle. These correlations along with
the presence of displaced vertices in the decay of the lightest neutralino can
be further investigated as a test of $\mu\nu$SSM in collider experiments.
