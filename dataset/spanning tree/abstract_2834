We prove that the group algebra of the hyperoctahedral group contains a
subalgebra corresponding to the flag descent number of Adin, Brenti, and
Roichman. This algebra is in fact the span of the basis elements of the type A
and type B Eulerian descent algebras. We describe a set of orthogonal
idempotents which spans the flag descent algebra and prove that it contains the
type A Eulerian descent algebra as a two-sided ideal. Using a new colored
analogue of Stanley's $P$-partitions, we prove the existence of a colored
Eulerian descent algebra which is a subalgebra of the Mantaci-Reutenauer
algebra. We also describe a set of orthogonal idempotents that spans the
colored Eulerian descent algebra and includes, as a special case, the familiar
Eulerian idempotents in the group algebra of the symmetric group.
