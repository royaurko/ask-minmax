We introduce a certain class of bi-type Galton-Watson trees with edge
lengths. We prove that, after an adequate rescaling, the weighted height
function of a forest of such trees converges in law to the reflected Brownian
motion. In a second time, using the results obtained in the first part, we
prove under mild conditions an invariance principle for multitype Galton-Watson
trees with infinitely many types, thus extending a result of G. Miermont on
multitype Galton-Watson trees.
