We propose a novel procedure for handling processes that involve unstable
intermediate particles. By using gauge-invariant effective Lagrangians it is
possible to perform a gauge-invariant resummation of (arbitrary) self-energy
effects. For instance, gauge-invariant tree-level amplitudes can be constructed
with the decay widths of the unstable particles properly included in the
propagators. In these tree-level amplitudes modified vertices are used, which
contain extra gauge-restoring terms prescribed by the effective Lagrangians. We
discuss the treatment of the phenomenologically important unstable particles,
like the top-quark, the $W$- and $Z$-bosons, and the Higgs-boson, and derive
the relevant modified Feynman rules explicitly.
