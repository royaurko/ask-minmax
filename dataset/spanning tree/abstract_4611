The notion of a strongly summing sequence is introduced. Such a sequence is
weak-Cauchy, a basis for its closed linear span, and has the crucial property
that the dual of this span is not weakly sequentially complete. The main
result is:
  Theorem. Every non-trivial weak-Cauchy sequence in a \RM(real or complex\RM)
Banach space has either a strongly summing sequence or a convex block basis
equivalent to the summing basis.
  (A weak-Cauchy sequence is called {\it non-trivial} if it is {\it non-weakly
convergent}.) The following characterization of spaces containing $c_0$ is
thus obtained, in the spirit of the contributor's 1974 subsequence principle.
  Corollary 1. A Banach space $B$ contains no isomorph of $c_0$ if and only if
every non-trivial weak-Cauchy sequence in $B$ has a strongly summing
subsequence.
  Combining the $c_0$-and $\ell^1$-theorems, one obtains
  Corollary 2. If $B$ is a non-reflexive Banach space such that $X^*$ is
weakly sequentially complete for all linear subspaces $X$ of $B$, then $c_0$
embeds in $B$.
