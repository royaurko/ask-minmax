Motivated by the recent result of [EJT10] showing that MSO properties are
Logspace computable on graphs of bounded tree-width, we consider the complexity
of computing the determinant of the adjacency matrix of a bounded tree-width
graph and prove that it is L-complete. It is important to notice that the
determinant is neither an MSO-property nor counts the number of solutions of an
MSO-predicate. We extend this technique to count the number of spanning
arborescences and directed Euler tours in bounded tree-width digraphs, and
further to counting the number of spanning trees and the number of Euler tours
in undirected graphs, all in L. Notice that undirected Euler tours are not
known to be MSO-expressible and the corresponding counting problem is in fact
#P-hard for general graphs. Counting undirected Euler tours in bounded
tree-width graphs was not known to be polynomial time computable till very
recently Chebolu et al [CCM13] gave a polynomial time algorithm for this
problem (concurrently and independently of this work). Finally, we also show
some linear algebraic extensions of the determinant algorithm to show how to
compute the charcteristic polynomial and trace of the powers of a bounded
tree-width graph in L.
