The problem of {\em efficiently} finding the best match for a query in a
given set with respect to the Euclidean distance or the cosine similarity has
been extensively studied in literature. However, a closely related problem of
efficiently finding the best match with respect to the inner product has never
been explored in the general setting to the best of our knowledge. In this
paper we consider this general problem and contrast it with the existing
best-match algorithms. First, we propose a general branch-and-bound algorithm
using a tree data structure. Subsequently, we present a dual-tree algorithm for
the case where there are multiple queries. Finally we present a new data
structure for increasing the efficiency of the dual-tree algorithm. These
branch-and-bound algorithms involve novel bounds suited for the purpose of
best-matching with inner products. We evaluate our proposed algorithms on a
variety of data sets from various applications, and exhibit up to five orders
of magnitude improvement in query time over the naive search technique.
