We will define an operad $\mathcal{B}^0$ on planar rooted trees.
$\mathcal{B}^0$ is analgous to the $NAP$-operad in the non-planar tree setting.
We will define a family of "current-preserving" operads $\mathcal{B}^\lambda$
depending on a scalar parameter $\lambda$, which can be seen as a deformation
of the operad $\mathcal{B}^0$. Forgetting the extra "current preserving" notion
above give back the Brace operad for $\lambda=1$ and the $\mathcal{B}^0$ operad
for $\lambda=0$. A natural map from non-planar rooted trees to plane ones gives
back the current-preserving interpolation between $NAP$ and pre-Lie
investigated in a previous article.
