An $L(2, 1)$-labeling of a graph $G$ is an assignment of a nonnegative
integer to each vertex of $G$ such that adjacent vertices receive integers that
differ by at least two and vertices at distance two receive distinct integers.
The span of such a labeling is the difference between the largest and smallest
integers used. The $\lambda$-number of $G$, denoted by $\lambda(G)$, is the
minimum span over all $L(2, 1)$-labelings of $G$. Bodlaender {\it et al.}
conjectured that if $G$ is an outerplanar graph of maximum degree $\Delta$,
then $\lambda(G)\leq \Delta+2$. Calamoneri and Petreschi proved that this
conjecture is true when $\Delta \geq 8$ but false when $\Delta=3$. Meanwhile,
they proved that $\lambda(G)\leq \Delta+5$ for any outerplanar graph $G$ with
$\Delta=3$ and asked whether or not this bound is sharp. In this paper we
answer this question by proving that $\lambda(G)\leq \Delta + 3$ for every
outerplanar graph with maximum degree $\Delta=3$. We also show that this bound
$\Delta + 3$ can be achieved by infinitely many outerplanar graphs with
$\Delta=3$.
