This paper considers the enumeration of trees avoiding a contiguous pattern.
We provide an algorithm for computing the generating function that counts
n-leaf binary trees avoiding a given binary tree pattern t. Equipped with this
counting mechanism, we study the analogue of Wilf equivalence in which two tree
patterns are equivalent if the respective n-leaf trees that avoid them are
equinumerous. We investigate the equivalence classes combinatorially. Toward
establishing bijective proofs of tree pattern equivalence, we develop a general
method of restructuring trees that conjecturally succeeds to produce an
explicit bijection for each pair of equivalent tree patterns.
