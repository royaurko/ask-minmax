Every weighted tree corresponds naturally to a cooperative game that we call
a "tree game"; it assigns to each subset of leaves the sum of the weights of
the minimal subtree spanned by those leaves. In the context of phylogenetic
trees, the leaves are species and this assignment captures the diversity
present in the coalition of species considered. We consider the Shapley value
of tree games and suggest a biological interpretation. We determine the linear
transformation M that shows the dependence of the Shapley value on the edge
weights of the tree, and we also compute a null space basis of M. Both depend
on the "split counts" of the tree. Finally, we characterize the Shapley value
on tree games by four axioms, a counterpart to Shapley's original theorem on
the larger class of cooperative games.
