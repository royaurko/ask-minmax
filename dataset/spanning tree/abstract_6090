We design two deterministic polynomial time algorithms for variants of a
problem introduced by Edmonds in 1967: determine the rank of a matrix M whose
entries are homogeneous linear polynomials over the integers. Given a linear
subspace B of the n by n matrices over some field F, we consider the following
problems: symbolic matrix rank (SMR) is the problem to determine the maximum
rank among matrices in B, symbolic determinant identity testing (SDIT) is the
question to decide whether there exists a nonsingular matrix in B. The
constructive versions of these problems are asking to find a matrix of maximum
rank, respectively a nonsingular matrix, if there exists one.
  Our first algorithm solves the constructive SMR when B is spanned by unknown
rank one matrices, answering an open question of Gurvits. Our second algorithm
solves the constructive SDIT when B is spanned by triangularizable matrices,
but the triangularization is not given explicitly. Both algorithms work over
finite fields of size at least n+1 and over the rational numbers, and the first
algorithm actually solves (the non-constructive) SMR independently from the
field size. Our main tool to obtain these results is to generalize Wong
sequences, a classical method to deal with pairs of matrices, to the case of
pairs of matrix spaces.
