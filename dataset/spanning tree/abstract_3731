We introduce a new phylogenetic reconstruction algorithm which, unlike most
previous rigorous inference techniques, does not rely on assumptions regarding
the branch lengths or the depth of the tree. The algorithm returns a forest
which is guaranteed to contain all edges that are: 1) sufficiently long and 2)
sufficiently close to the leaves. How much of the true tree is recovered
depends on the sequence length provided. The algorithm is distance-based and
runs in polynomial time.
