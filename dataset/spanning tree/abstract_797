For any probability space and a collection of events with what we call a
lopsided association graph, we give an algorithmic proof of the Lopsided Lovasz
Local Lemma, and its stronger known forms. The only algorithmic assumption is
the availability of a resampling oracle for each event. The resampling oracles
act as an abstraction layer that isolates the details of the proof from the
details of the probability space. The number of resamplings performed by the
algorithm is bounded by expressions similar to those obtained by Moser and
Tardos, and others. The overall computational efficiency depends on the runtime
of the resampling oracles. We develop efficient resampling oracles for the
known uses of the Lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma, unifying previous algorithmic
applications and presenting new results for packings of Latin transversals,
rainbow matchings and rainbow spanning trees.
