We extend the quasi-tree expansion of A. Champanerkar, I. Kofman, and N.
Stoltzfus to not necessarily orientable ribbon graphs. We study the duality
properties of the Bollobas-Riordan polynomial in terms of this expansion. As a
corollary, we get a "connected state" expansion of the Kauffman bracket of
virtual link diagrams. Our proofs use extensively the partial duality of S.
Chmutov.
