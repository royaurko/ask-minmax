A large data set of charged-pion electroproduction from both hydrogen and
deuterium targets has been obtained spanning the low-energy residual-mass
region. These data conclusively show the onset of the quark-hadron duality
phenomenon, as predicted for high-energy hadron electroproduction. We construct
several ratios from these data to exhibit the relation of this phenomenon to
the high-energy factorization ansatz of electron-quark scattering and
subsequent quark-to- pion production mechanisms.
