The affine group of a tree is the group of the isometries of a homogeneous
tree that fix an end of its boundary. Consider a probability measure on this
group and the associated random walk. The main goal of this paper is to
determine the accumulation points of the potential kernel at the infinity. In
particular we show that under suitable regularity hypotheses this kernel can be
continuously extended to the tree boundary and we determine the limit measures.
