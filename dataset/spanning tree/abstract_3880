We start by constructing a new root system for rational triple singularities
and determine the number of roots for each rational triple singularity. Then we
show that, for each root, we obtain a linear free divisor. So we obtain a new
family of linear free divisors. This gives the converse part of an existing
theorem which says, by using the quiver representation, that linear free
divisors come from a tree. We prove that our construction is independent of the
orientation on the rational triple trees. Furthermore, we deduce that linear
free divisors defined by rational triple quivers satisfy the logarithmic
comparison theorem. In last section, we generalize the results of these results
to rational quasi-determinantal singularities.
