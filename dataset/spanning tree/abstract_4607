We present the results of an O(alpha_s) calculation of the transverse
polarization of top quarks produced in e+e- annihilation. In a first step we
determine the transverse polarization of the top with regard to the hadron
plane spanned by the (q,bar q,g) system. We then rotate the transverse
components of the polarization to the lepton plane spanned by the (q,e+,e-)
system. After azimuthal averaging we determine the three remaining inclusive
transversely polarized structure functions. Together with the one-loop and Born
term contributions they determine the sin(theta) and sin(2*theta) beam-quark
polar angle dependence of the transverse polarization. We present analytic and
numerical results for the polarized structure functions and the polar angle
dependence of the transverse polarization. We briefly comment on the transverse
polarization of bottom quarks produced in e+e- annihilation.
