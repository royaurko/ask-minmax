We give a Large Deviation Principle (LDP) with explicit rate function for the
distribution of vertex degrees in plane trees, a combinatorial model of RNA
secondary structures. We calculate the typical degree distributions based on
nearest neighbor free energies, and compare our results with the branching
configurations found in two sets of large RNA secondary structures. We find
substantial agreement overall, with some interesting deviations which merit
further study.
