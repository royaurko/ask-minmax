We express the partition functions of the spanning tree on finite square
lattices under five different sets of boundary conditions (free, cylindrical,
toroidal, M\"obius strip, and Klein bottle) in terms of a principal partition
function with twisted boundary conditions. Based on these expressions, we
derive the exact asymptotic expansions of the logarithm of the partition
function for each case. We have also established several groups of identities
relating spanning-tree partition functions for the different boundary
conditions. We also explain an apparent discrepancy between logarithmic
correction terms in the free energy for a two dimensional spanning tree model
with periodic and free boundary conditions and conformal field theory
predictions. We have obtain corner free energy for the spanning tree under free
boundary conditions in full agreement with conformal field theory predictions.
