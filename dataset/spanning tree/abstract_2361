We consider random arrays indexed by the leaves of an infinitary rooted tree
of finite depth, with the distribution invariant under the rearrangements that
preserve the tree structure. We call such arrays hierarchically exchangeable
and prove that they satisfy an analogue of de Finetti's theorem. We also prove
a more general result for arrays indexed by several trees, which includes a
hierarchical version of the Aldous-Hoover representation.
