We construct a modified on-shell BCFW recursion relation to derive compact
analytic representations of tree-level amplitudes in QED. As an application, we
study the amplitudes of a fermion pair coupling to an arbitrary number of
photons and give compact formulae for the NMHV and NNMHV case. We demonstrate
that the new recursion relation reduces the growth in complexity with
additional photons to be exponential rather than factorial.
