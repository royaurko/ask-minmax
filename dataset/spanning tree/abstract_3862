This paper presents a purely declarative approach to artifact-centric case
management systems, and a decentralization scheme for this model. Each case is
presented as a tree-like structure; nodes bear information that combines data
and computations. Each node belongs to a given stakeholder, and semantic rules
govern the evolution of the tree structure, as well as how data values derive
from information stemming from the context of the node. Stakeholders
communicate through asynchronous message passing without shared memory,
enabling convenient distribution.
