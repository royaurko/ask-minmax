We describe how to disentangle the singly- and doubly-unresolved (soft and/or
collinear) limits of tree-level QCD squared matrix elements. Using the
factorization formulae presented in this paper, we outline a viable general
subtraction scheme for computing next-to-next-to-leading order corrections for
electron-positron annihilation into jets.
