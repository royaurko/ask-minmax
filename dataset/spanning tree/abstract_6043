Invariant notions of a class of Segre varieties $\Segrem(2)$ of PG(2^m - 1,
2) that are direct products of $m$ copies of PG(1, 2), $m$ being any positive
integer, are established and studied. We first demonstrate that there exists a
hyperbolic quadric that contains $\Segrem(2)$ and is invariant under its
projective stabiliser group $\Stab{m}{2}$. By embedding PG(2^m - 1, 2) into
\PG(2^m - 1, 4), a basis of the latter space is constructed that is invariant
under $\Stab{m}{2}$ as well. Such a basis can be split into two subsets whose
spans are either real or complex-conjugate subspaces according as $m$ is even
or odd. In the latter case, these spans can, in addition, be viewed as
indicator sets of a $\Stab{m}{2}$-invariant geometric spread of lines of PG(2^m
- 1, 2). This spread is also related with a $\Stab{m}{2}$-invariant
non-singular Hermitian variety. The case $m=3$ is examined in detail to
illustrate the theory. Here, the lines of the invariant spread are found to
fall into four distinct orbits under $\Stab{3}{2}$, while the points of PG(7,
2) form five orbits.
