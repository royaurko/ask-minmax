For any graph $G$, let $t(G)$ be the number of spanning trees of $G$, $L(G)$
be the line graph of $G$ and for any non-negative integer $r$, $S_r(G)$ be the
graph obtained from $G$ by replacing each edge $e$ by a path of length $r+1$
connecting the two ends of $e$. In this paper we find a combinatorial approach
to obtain %an expression for $t(L(G))$ and more generally an expression for
$t(L(S_r(G)))$. Thus we generalize some known results on the relation between
$t(L(G))$ and $t(G)$ and prove a conjecture that
$t(L(S_1(G)))=k^{m+s-n-1}(k+2)^{m-n+1}t(G)$ for any graph $G$ of order $n+s$
and size $m+s$ in which $s$ vertices are of degree $1$ and the others are of
degree $k$.
