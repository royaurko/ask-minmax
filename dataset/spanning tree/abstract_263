The minimum spanning tree clustering algorithm is capable of detecting
clusters with irregular boundaries. In this paper we propose two minimum
spanning trees based clustering algorithm. The first algorithm produces k
clusters with center and guaranteed intra-cluster similarity. The radius and
diameter of k clusters are computed to find the tightness of k clusters. The
variance of the k clusters are also computed to find the compactness of the
clusters. The second algorithm is proposed to create a dendrogram using the k
clusters as objects with guaranteed inter-cluster similarity. The algorithm is
also finds central cluster from the k number of clusters. The first algorithm
uses divisive approach, where as the second algorithm uses agglomerative
approach. In this paper we used both the approaches to find Informative Meta
similarity clusters.
