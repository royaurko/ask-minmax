The construction of a dendogram on a set of individuals is a key component of
a genomewide association study. However even with modern sequencing
technologies the distances on the individuals required for the construction of
such a structure may not always be reliable making it tempting to exclude them
from an analysis. This, in turn, results in an input set for dendogram
construction that consists of only partial distance information which raises
the following fundamental question. For what subset of its leaf set can we
reconstruct uniquely the dendogram from the distances that it induces on that
subset. By formalizing a dendogram in terms of an edge-weighted, rooted
phylogenetic tree on a pre-given finite set X with |X|>2 whose edge-weighting
is equidistant and a set of partial distances on X in terms of a set L of
2-subsets of X, we investigate this problem in terms of when such a tree is
lassoed, that is, uniquely determined by the elements in L. For this we
consider four different formalizations of the idea of "uniquely determining"
giving rise to four distinct types of lassos. We present characterizations for
all of them in terms of the child-edge graphs of the interior vertices of such
a tree. Our characterizations imply in particular that in case the tree in
question is binary then all four types of lasso must coincide.
