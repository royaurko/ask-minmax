We derive abundances and central star parameters for 15 planetary nebulae
(PNe) in M31: 12 in the bulge and 3 in a disk field 14 kpc from the nucleus. No
single abundance value characterizes the bulge stars: although the median
abundances of the sample are similar to those seen for PNe in the LMC, the
distribution of abundances is several times broader, spanning over 1 decade.
None of the PNe in our sample approach the super metal-rich ([Fe/H] ~ +0.25)
expectations for the bulge of M31, although a few PNe in the sample of
Stasinska, Richer, & Mc~Call (1998) come close. This [O/H] vs [Fe/H]
discrepancy is likely due to a combination of factors, including an inability
of metal-rich stars to produce bright PNe, a luminosity selection effect, and
an abundance gradient in the bulge of M31. We show that PNe that are near the
bright limit of the [OIII] 5007 planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF)
span nearly a decade in oxygen abundance, and thus, support the use of the PNLF
for deriving distances to galaxies (Jacoby 1996) with differing metallicities.
We also identify a correlation between central star mass and PN dust formation
that partially alleviates any dependence of the PNLF maximum magnitude on
population age. Additionally, we identify a spatially compact group of 5 PNe
having unusually high O/H; this subgroup may arise from a recent merger, but
velocity information is needed to assess the true nature of the objects.
