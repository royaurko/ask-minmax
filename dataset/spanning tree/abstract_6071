We study the local distinguishability of general multi-qubit states and show
that local projective measurements and classical communication are as powerful
as the most general local measurements and classical communication. Remarkably,
this indicates that the local distinguishability of multi-qubit states can be
decided efficiently. Another useful consequence is that a set of orthogonal
$n$-qubit states is locally distinguishable only if the summation of their
orthogonal Schmidt numbers is less than the total dimension $2^n$. When $n=2$
such a condition is also sufficient. Employing these results, we show that any
orthonormal basis of a subspace spanned by arbitrary three-qubit orthogonal
unextendible product bases (UPB) cannot be exactly distinguishable by local
operations and classical communication. This not only reveals another intrinsic
property of three-qubit orthogonal UPB, but also provides a class of locally
indistinguishable subspaces with dimension 4. We also explicitly construct
locally indistinguishable subspaces with dimensions 3 and 5, respectively. In
particular, 3 is the minimal possible dimension of locally indistinguishable
subspaces. Combining with the previous results, we conclude that any positive
integer between 3 and 7 is the possible dimension of some three-qubit locally
indistinguishable subspace.
