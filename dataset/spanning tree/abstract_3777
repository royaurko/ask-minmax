We prove that every sufficiently big 6-connected graph of bounded tree-width
either has a K_6 minor, or has a vertex whose deletion makes the graph planar.
This is a step toward proving that the same conclusion holds for all
sufficiently big 6-connected graphs. Jorgensen conjectured that it holds for
all 6-connected graphs.
