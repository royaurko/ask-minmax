Within the framework of generalized combinatorial approach, complexity is
determined as a disorder measure for hierarchical statistical ensembles related
to Cayley trees possessing arbitrary branching and number of levels. With
strengthening hierarchical coupling, the complexity is shown to increase
monotonically to the limit value that grows with tree branching. In contrast to
the temperature dependence of thermodynamic entropy, the complexity is reduced
by the variance of hierarchical statistical ensemble if the branching exponent
does not exceed the gold mean. Time dependencies are found for both the
probability distribution over ensemble states and the related complexity. The
latter is found explicitly for self-similar ensemble and generalized for
arbitrary hierarchical trees.
