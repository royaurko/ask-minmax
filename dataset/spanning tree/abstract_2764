We show how to force, with finite conditions, the forcing axiom PFA(T), a
relativization of PFA to proper forcing notions preserving a given Souslin tree
T. The proof uses a Neeman style iteration with generalized side conditions
consisting of models of two types, and a preservation theorem for such
iterations. The consistency of this axiom was previously known by the standard
countable support iteration, using a preservation theorem due to Miyamoto.
