We present a numerical method to compute the evolution of vortex filaments in
superfluid helium. The method is based on a tree algorithm which considerably
speeds up the calculation of Biot-Savart integrals. We show that the
computational cost scales as Nlog{(N) rather than N squared, where $N$ is the
number of discretization points. We test the method and its properties for a
variety of vortex configurations, ranging from simple vortex rings to a
counterflow vortex tangle, and compare results against the Local Induction
Approximation and the exact Biot-Savart law.
