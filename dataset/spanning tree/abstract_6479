We develop an algorithm of polynomial complexity for evaluating one-loop
amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external particles. The algorithm is
implemented in the Rocket program. Starting from particle vertices given by
Feynman rules, tree amplitudes are constructed using recursive relations. The
tree amplitudes are then used to build one-loop amplitudes using an integer
dimension on-shell cut method. As a first application we considered only three
and four gluon vertices calculating the pure gluonic one-loop amplitudes for
arbitrary external helicity or polarization states. We compare our numerical
results to analytical results in the literature, analyze the time behavior of
the algorithm and the accuracy of the results, and give explicit results for
fixed phase space points for up to twenty external gluons.
