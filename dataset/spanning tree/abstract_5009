We present the first results of an ongoing project to study the
morphological, kinematical, dynamical, and chemical properties of satellite
galaxies of external giant spiral galaxies. The sample of objects has been
selected from the catalogue by Zaritsky et al. (1997). The paper analyzes the
morphology and structural parameters of a subsample of 60 such objects. The
satellites span a great variety of morphologies and surface brightness
profiles. About two thirds of the sample are spirals and irregulars, the
remaining third being early-types. Some cases showing interaction between pairs
of satellites are presented and briefly discussed.
