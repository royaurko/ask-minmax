Kreweras proved that the codegree enumerator for parking functions of length
$n$ is equal to the inversion enumerator for labeled trees on $n+1$ vertices.
Recently, Perkinson, Yang, and Yu gave a bijective proof of this equality that
moreover generalizes to graphical parking functions. Using a depth-first search
variant of Dhar's burning algorithm they proved that the codegree enumerator
for $G$-parking functions equals the $\kappa$-number enumerator for spanning
trees of $G$. The $\kappa$-number is a kind of generalized tree inversion
number originally defined by Gessel. We extend the work of Perkinson-Yang-Yu to
what are referred to as "generalized parking functions" in the literature, but
which we prefer to call vector parking functions because they depend on a
choice of vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{N}^n$. Specifically, we give an
expression for the codegree enumerator for $\mathbf{x}$-parking functions in
terms of $\kappa$-numbers in rooted plane trees with respect to certain
admissible vertex orders. Along the way we clarify the relationship between
graphical and vector parking functions.
