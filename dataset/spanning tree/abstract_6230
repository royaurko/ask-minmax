As continuation of our previous paper we further develop our new method for
calculating helicity amplitudes of jet-like QED processes described by tree
diagrams, applying it to lepton pair production. This method consists in
replacing spinor structures for real and weakly virtual intermediate leptons by
simple transition vertices. New vertices are introduced for the pair production
case, and previous bremsstrahlung vertices are generalized to include virtual
photons inside the considered jet. We present a diagrammatic approach that
allows to write down in an efficient way the leading helicity amplitudes, at
tree level. The obtained compact amplitudes are particularly suitable for
numerical calculations in jet-like kinematics. Several examples with up to four
particles in a jet are discussed in detail.
