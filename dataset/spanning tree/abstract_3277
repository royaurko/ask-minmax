We use topological methods to compute the mod p cohomology of certain
p-groups. More precisely we look at central Frattini extensions of elementary
abelian by elementary abelian groups such that their defining k-invariants span
the entire image of the Bockstein. We show that if p is sufficiently large,
then the mod p cohomology of the extension can be explicitly computed as an
algebra.
