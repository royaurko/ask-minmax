In this paper we describe all indecomposable two-term partial tilting
complexes over a Brauer tree algebra with multiplicity 1 using a criterion for
a minimal projective presentation of a module to be a partial tilting complex.
As an application we describe all two-term tilting complexes over Brauer star
algebra and compute their endomorphism rings.
