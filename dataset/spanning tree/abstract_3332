A lattice is called well-rounded, if its lattice vectors of minimal length
span the ambient space. We show that there are interesting connections between
the existence of well-rounded sublattices and coincidence site lattices (CSLs).
Furthermore, we count the number of well-rounded sublattices for several planar
lattices and give their asymptotic behaviour.
