The impact of an anti-unitary symmetry on the spectrum of non-hermitean
operators is studied. Wigner's normal form of an anti-unitary operator is shown
to account for the spectral properties of non-hermitean, PT-symmetric
Hamiltonians. Both the occurrence of single real or complex conjugate pairs of
eigenvalues follows from this theory. The corresponding energy eigenstates span
either one- or two-dimensional irreducible representations of the symmetry PT.
In this framework, the concept of a spontaneously broken PT-symmetry is not
needed.
