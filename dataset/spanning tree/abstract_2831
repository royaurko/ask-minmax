The magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of Ga1-xCMn3+x have been
investigated. Reversible magnetocaloric effect (MCE) occurs near the Curie
temperature TC. The magnetic entropy change decreases with increasing x, though
TC and magnetization increases. Meanwhile, the temperature span of vs. T plot
becomes well broadened with x. Due to the competition between the broadening
temperature span and decreasing, the relative cooling power (RCP) increases
initially, and then decreases with increasing x. The largest RCP (2.1 J/cm3,
under 45 kOe) observed when x=0.07 (TC = 296.5 K) is comparable to the
contemporary magnetic refrigerant materials. Considering the reversible MCE,
inexpensive and innoxious raw materials, our result suggests that Ga1-xCMn3+x
can be promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration around room temperature.
