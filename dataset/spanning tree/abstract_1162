We show that compact cardinals and {\rm MM} are sensitive to $\lambda$-closed
forcings for arbitrarily large $\lambda$. This is done by adding 'regressive'
$\lambda$-Kurepa-trees in either case. We argue that the destruction of
regressive Kurepa-trees with {\rm MM} requires the use of Namba forcing.
