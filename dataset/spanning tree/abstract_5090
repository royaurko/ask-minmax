A kinematical description of infinitesimal deformations of the worldsheet
spanned in spacetime by a relativistic membrane is presented. This provides a
framework for obtaining both the classical equations of motion and the
equations describing infinitesimal deformations about solutions of these
equations when the action describing the dynamics of this membrane is
constructed using {\it any} local geometrical worldsheet scalars. As examples,
we consider a Nambu membrane, and an action quadratic in the extrinsic
curvature of the worldsheet.
