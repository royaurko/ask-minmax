We prove the existence of the total length process for the genealogical tree
of a population model with random size given by a quadratic stationary
continuous-state branching processes. We also give, for the one-dimensional
marginal, its Laplace transform as well as the fluctuation of the corresponding
convergence. This result is to be compared with the one obtained by
Pfaffelhuber and Wakolbinger for constant size population associated to the
Kingma coalescent. We also give a time reversal property of the number of
ancestors process at all time, and give a description of the so-called lineage
tree in this model.
