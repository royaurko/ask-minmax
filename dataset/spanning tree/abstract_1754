We study the bounded regions in a generic slice of the hyperplane arrangement
in $\mathbb{R}^n$ consisting of the hyperplanes defined by $x_i$ and $x_i+x_j$.
The bounded regions are in bijection with several classes of combinatorial
objects, including the ordered partitions of $[n]$ all of whose left-to-right
minima occur at odd locations and the drawings of rooted plane trees with $n+1$
vertices. These are sequences of rooted plane trees such that each tree in a
sequence can be obtained from the next one by removing a leaf.
