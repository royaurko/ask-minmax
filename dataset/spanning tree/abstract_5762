The total cross section for the $pp \to pp \pi^0$ reaction at energies close
to threshold is calculated within the frame of a chiral perturbation theory,
taking into account tree and one loop diagrams up to chiral order D=2. Two-pion
loop contributions dominate $\pi^0$ production at threshold. The calculated
cross section reproduces data, both scale and energy dependence, fairly well.
