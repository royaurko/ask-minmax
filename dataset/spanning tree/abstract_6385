A complete and user-friendly directory of tails of Archimedean copulas is
presented which can be used in the selection and construction of appropriate
models with desired properties. The results are synthesized in the form of a
decision tree: Given the values of some readily computable characteristics of
the Archimedean generator, the upper and lower tails of the copula are
classified into one of three classes each, one corresponding to asymptotic
dependence and the other two to asymptotic independence. For a long list of
single-parameter families, the relevant tail quantities are computed so that
the corresponding classes in the decision tree can easily be determined. In
addition, new models with tailor-made upper and lower tails can be constructed
via a number of transformation methods. The frequently occurring category of
asymptotic independence turns out to conceal a surprisingly rich variety of
tail dependence structures.
