We investigate the quasi-isometry classification of the right-angled Coxeter
groups W_\Gamma\ which are 1-ended and have triangle-free defining graph
\Gamma. We begin by characterising those W_\Gamma\ which split over 2-ended
subgroups, and those which are cocompact Fuchsian, in terms of properties of
\Gamma. This allows us to apply a theorem of Papasoglu to distinguish several
quasi-isometry classes. We then carry out a complete quasi-isometry
classification of the hyperbolic W_\Gamma\ with \Gamma\ a generalised \Theta\
graph. For this we use Bowditch's JSJ tree and the quasi-isometries of
"fattened trees" introduced by Behrstock--Neumann. Combined with a
commensurability classification due to Crisp--Paoluzzi, it follows that there
are right-angled Coxeter groups which are quasi-isometric but not
commensurable. Finally, we generalise the work of Crisp--Paoluzzi.
