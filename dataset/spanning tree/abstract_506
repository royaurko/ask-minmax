By analyzing the foreign exchange market data of various currencies, we
derive a hierarchical taxonomy of currencies constructing minimal-spanning
trees. Clustered structure of the currencies and the key currency in each
cluster are found. The clusters match nicely with the geographical regions of
corresponding countries in the world such as Asia or East Europe, the key
currencies are generally given by major economic countries as expected.
