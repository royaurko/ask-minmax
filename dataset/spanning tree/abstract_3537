Everything that is not prohibited is permissible. So, what is prohibited in
the course of chemical reactions, heat transfer and other dissipative
processes? Is it possible to "overshoot" the equilibrium, and if yes, then how
far? Thermodynamically allowed and prohibited trajectories of processes are
discussed by the example of effects of equilibrium encircling. The complete
theory of thermodynamically accessible states is presented. The space of all
thermodynamically admissible paths is presented by projection on the
"thermodynamic tree", that is the tree of the related thermodynamic potential
(entropy, free energy, free enthalpy) in the balance polyhedron. The stationary
states and limit points for open systems are localized too.
