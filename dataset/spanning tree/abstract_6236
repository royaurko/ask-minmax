We calculate the tree-level oblique corrections to electroweak precision
observables generated in higgless models of electroweak symmetry breaking with
a 5D SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} gauge group on a warped background. In the
absence of brane induced kinetic terms (and equal left and right gauge
couplings) we find the S parameter to be ~1.15, while T,U~0, as in technicolor
theories. Planck brane induced kinetic terms and unequal left-right couplings
can lower S, however for sufficiently low values of S tree-level unitarity will
be lost. A kinetic term localized on the TeV brane for SU(2)_D will generically
increase S, however an induced kinetic term for U(1)_{B-L} on the TeV brane
will lower S. With an appropriate choice of the value of this induced kinetic
term S~0 can be achieved. In this case the mass of the lowest Z' mode will be
lowered to about ~300 GeV.
