While the Ising model on the Cayley tree has no spontaneous magnetization at
nonzero temperatures in the thermodynamic limit, we show that finite systems of
astronomical sizes remain magnetically ordered in a wide temperature range, if
the symmetry is broken by fixing an arbitrary single (bulk or surface) spin. We
compare the behavior of the finite size magnetization of this model with that
of the Ising model on both the Sierpinski Gasket, and the one-dimensional
linear chain. This comparison reveals the analogy of the behavior of the
present model with the Sierpinski Gasket case.
