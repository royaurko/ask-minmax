We introduce Khovanov homology for ribbon graphs and show that the Khovanov
homology of a certain ribbon graph embedded on the Turaev surface of a link is
isomorphic to the Khovanov homology of the link (after a grading shift). We
also present a spanning quasi-tree model for the Khovanov homology of a ribbon
graph.
