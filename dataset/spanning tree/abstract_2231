Recently, tree-level recursion relations for scattering amplitudes of gluons
in Yang-Mills theory have been derived. In this note we propose a
generalization of the recursion relations to tree-level scattering amplitudes
of gravitons. We use the relations to derive new simple formulae for all
amplitudes up to six gravitons. In particular, we present an explicit formula
for the six graviton non-MHV amplitude. We prove the relations for MHV and
next-to-MHV n-graviton amplitudes and for all eight-graviton amplitudes.
