We study random two-dimensional spanning forests in the plane that can be
viewed both in the discrete case and in their scaling limit as slight
perturbations of an uniformly chosen spanning tree. We show how to relate this
scaling limit to a stationary distribution of a natural Markov process on a
state of abstract graphs with non-constant edge-weights. This simple Markov
process can be viewed as a renormalization flow, so that in this
two-dimensional case, one can give a rigorous meaning to the fact that there is
a unique fixed point (ie. stationary distribution) in two dimensions for this
renormalization flow, and that when starting from any periodic two-dimensional
lattice, the renormalization flow converges to this fixed point (ie. the Markov
process converges in law to its stationary distribution).
  While the results of this paper are dealing with the planar case and build on
the convergence in distribution of branches of the UST to SLE$_2$ as well as on
the predicted convergence of the suitably renormalized length of the
loop-erased random walk to the "natural parametrization" of the SLE$_2$, this
Markov process setup is in fact not restricted to two dimensions.
