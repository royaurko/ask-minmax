We investigate the random continuous trees called L\'evy trees, which are
obtained as scaling limits of discrete Galton-Watson trees. We give a
mathematically precise definition of these random trees as random variables
taking values in the set of equivalence classes of compact rooted R-trees,
which is equipped with the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. To construct L\'evy
trees, we make use of the coding by the height process which was studied in
detail in previous work. We then investigate various probabilistic properties
of L\'evy trees. In particular we establish a branching property analogous to
the well-known property for Galton-Watson trees: Conditionally given the tree
below level a, the subtrees originating from that level are distributed as the
atoms of a Poisson point measure whose intensity involves a local time measure
supported on the vertices at distance a from the root. We study regularity
properties of local times in the space variable, and prove that the support of
local time is the full level set, except for certain exceptional values of a
corresponding to local extinctions. We also compute several fractal dimensions
of L\'evy trees, including Hausdorff and packing dimensions, in terms of lower
and upper indices for the branching mechanism function $\psi$ which
characterizes the distribution of the tree. We finally discuss some
applications to super-Brownian motion with a general branching mechanism.
