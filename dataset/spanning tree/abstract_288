Two classical concepts of centrality in a graph are the median and the
center. The connected notions of the status and the radius of a graph seem to
be in no relation. In this paper, however, we show a clear connection of both
concepts, as they obtain their minimum and maximum values at the same type of
tree graphs. Trees with fixed maximum degree and extremum radius and status,
resp., are characterized. The bounds on radius and status can be transferred to
general connected graphs via spanning trees.
  A new method of proof allows not only to regain results of Lin et al. on
graphs with extremum status, but it allows also to prove analogous results on
graphs with extremum radius.
