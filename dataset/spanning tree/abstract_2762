The extinction probability of the Markovian Binary Tree (MBT) is the minimal
nonnegative solution of a Quadratic Vector Equation (QVE). In this paper, we
present a perturbation analysis for the extinction probability of a
supercritical MBT. We derive a perturbation bound for the minimal nonnegative
solution of the QVE, and an error bound is also given, which can be used to
measure the quality of an approximation solution. Numerical tests show that
these bounds are fairly sharp.
