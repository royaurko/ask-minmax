This document summarizes the proofs made during a Coq development inSummer
2015. This development investigates the function G introducedby Hofstadter in
his famous "G\"odel, Escher, Bach" bookas well as a related infinite tree. The
left/right flipped variantof this G tree has also been studied here,
followingHofstadter's "problem for the curious reader".The initial G function
is refered as sequence A005206 inOEIS, while the flipped version is the
sequence A123070.
