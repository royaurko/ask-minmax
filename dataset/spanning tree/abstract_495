We postulate the existence of a natural Poissonian marking of the double
(touching) points of SLE(6) and hence of the related continuum nonsimple loop
process that describes macroscopic cluster boundaries in 2D critical
percolation. We explain how these marked loops should yield continuum versions
of near-critical percolation, dynamical percolation, minimal spanning trees and
related plane filling curves, and invasion percolation. We show that this
yields for some of the continuum objects a conformal covariance property that
generalizes the conformal invariance of critical systems. It is an open problem
to rigorously construct the continuum objects and to prove that they are indeed
the scaling limits of the corresponding lattice objects.
