Consider an infinite graph with nodes initially labeled by independent
Bernoulli random variables of parameter p. We address the density
classification problem, that is, we want to design a (probabilistic or
deterministic) cellular automaton or a finite-range interacting particle system
that evolves on this graph and decides whether p is smaller or larger than 1/2.
Precisely, the trajectories should converge to the uniform configuration with
only 0's if p<1/2, and only 1's if p>1/2. We present solutions to that problem
on the d-dimensional lattice, for any d>1, and on the regular infinite trees.
For Z, we propose some candidates that we back up with numerical simulations.
