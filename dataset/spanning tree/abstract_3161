We present a purely combinatorial solution of the problem of enumerating
planar bicubic maps with hard particles. This is done by use of a bijection
with a particular class of blossom trees with particles, obtained by an
appropriate cutting of the maps. Although these trees have no simple local
characterization, we prove that their enumeration may be performed upon
introducing a larger class of "admissible" trees with possibly doubly-occupied
edges and summing them with appropriate signed weights. The proof relies on an
extension of the cutting procedure allowing for the presence on the maps of
special non-sectile edges. The admissible trees are characterized by simple
local rules, allowing eventually for an exact enumeration of planar bicubic
maps with hard particles. We also discuss generalizations for maps with
particles subject to more general exclusion rules and show how to re-derive the
enumeration of quartic maps with Ising spins in the present framework of
admissible trees. We finally comment on a possible interpretation in terms of
branching processes.
