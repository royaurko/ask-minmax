A general analysis for B decays to two pseudoscalars, involving ten modes, is
presented. A simple model for final state interactions and rescattering effects
is proposed. We show how the data can be used to deduce important information
on electroweak penguins (EWP), rescattering and color suppression effects and
on the CKM parameters in a largely model independent way by using
chisquared-minimization. We find that the current data suggests the presence of
color-suppressed tree at levels somewhat larger than simple theoretical
estimates. Once the data improves the extraction of alpha and/or gamma may
become feasible with this method as we illustrate with the existing data.
