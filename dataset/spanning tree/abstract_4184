We consider noisy binary channels on regular trees and introduce periodic
enhancements consisting of locally self-correcting the signal in blocks without
break of the symmetry of the model. We focus on the realistic class of
within-descent self-correction realized by identifying all descendants $k$
generations down a vertex with their majority. We show that this also allows
reconstruction strictly beyond the critical distortion. We further identify the
limit at which the critical distortions of within-descent $k$ self-corrected
transmission converge, which turns out to be the critical point for
ferromagnetic Ising model on that tree. We finally discuss how similar
phenomena take place with the biologically more plausible mechanism of
eliminating signals which are locally not coherent with the majority.
