We calculate the eigenspectrum of random walks on the Eden tree in two and
three dimensions. From this, we calculate the spectral dimension $d_s$ and the
walk dimension $d_w$ and test the scaling relation $d_s = 2d_f/d_w$ ($=2d/d_w$
for an Eden tree). Finite-size induced crossovers are observed, whereby the
system crosses over from a short-time regime where this relation is violated
(particularly in two dimensions) to a long-time regime where the behavior
appears to be complicated and dependent on dimension even qualitatively.
