More than 500 pulsars are regularly observed with the 76-m Lovell radio
telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory. Precise positional and rotational
parameters have been obtained from observations spanning between 6 and 34 years
for over 300 of these pulsars. The parameters were determined by fitting a
timing model to whitened pulse arrival times. In this paper, the technique used
to whiten the timing residuals is summarised and the astrometric measurements
are compared to proper motions determined earlier with interferometers. This
novel approach has led to the first proper motion measurements for 111 pulsars
and improved results for 15 pulsars.
