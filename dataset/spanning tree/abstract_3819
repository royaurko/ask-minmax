Greedy embedding (or drawing) is a simple and efficient strategy to route
messages in wireless sensor networks. For each source-destination pair of nodes
s, t in a greedy embedding there is always a neighbor u of s that is closer to
t according to some distance metric. The existence of greedy embeddings in the
Euclidean plane R^2 is known for certain graph classes such as 3-connected
planar graphs. We completely characterize the trees that admit a greedy
embedding in R^2. This answers a question by Angelini et al. (Graph Drawing
2009) and is a further step in characterizing the graphs that admit Euclidean
greedy embeddings.
