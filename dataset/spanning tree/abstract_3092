The \emph{maximum a posteriori} (MAP) assignment for general structure Markov
random fields (MRFs) is computationally intractable. In this paper, we exploit
tree-based methods to efficiently address this problem. Our novel method, named
Tree-based Iterated Local Search (T-ILS) takes advantage of the tractability of
tree-structures embedded within MRFs to derive strong local search in an ILS
framework. The method efficiently explores exponentially large neighborhood and
does so with limited memory without any requirement on the cost functions. We
evaluate the T-ILS in a simulation of Ising model and two real-world problems
in computer vision: stereo matching, image denoising. Experimental results
demonstrate that our methods are competitive against state-of-the-art rivals
with a significant computational gain.
