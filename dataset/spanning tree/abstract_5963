The Matsumoto\,--Yor process is $\int\_0^t \exp(2B\_s-B\_t)\, ds$, where
$(B\_t)$ is a Brownian motion. It is shown that it is the limit of the radial
part of the Brownian motion at the bottom of the spectrum on the hyperbolic
space of dimension $q$, when $q$ tends to infinity. Analogous processes on
infinite series of non compact symmetric spaces and on regular trees are
described.
