In approximation algorithm design, light spanners has applications in
graph-metric problems such as metric TSP (the traveling salesman problem). We
have developed an efficient algorithm for light spanners in bounded pathwidth
graphs, based on an intermediate data structure called monotone tree. In this
paper, we extended the results to include bounded catwidth graphs.
