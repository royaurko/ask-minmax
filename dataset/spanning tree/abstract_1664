Multizeta values are real numbers which span a complicated algebra: there
exist two different interacting products. A functional analog of these numbers
is defined so as to obtain a better understanding of them, the Hurwitz
multizeta functions, which span an algebra for which a precise description is
wanted. In this note, we prove that the algebra of Hurwitz multizeta functions
is a polynomial algebra.
