In the paper we probe the possibilities of creating a Kurepa tree in a
generic extension of a model of CH plus no Kurepa trees by an
omega_1-preserving forcing notion of size at most omega_1. In the first
section we show that in the Levy model obtained by collapsing all cardinals
between omega_1 and a strongly inaccessible cardinal by forcing with a
countable support Levy collapsing order many omega_1-preserving forcing
notions of size at most omega_1 including all omega-proper forcing notions and
some proper but not omega-proper forcing notions of size at most omega_1 do
not create Kurepa trees. In the second section we construct a model of CH plus
no Kurepa trees, in which there is an omega-distributive Aronszajn tree such
that forcing with that Aronszajn tree does create a Kurepa tree in the generic
extension. At the end of the paper we ask three questions.
