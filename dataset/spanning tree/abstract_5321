We show that the constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic
n-space spanning the boundary of a star shaped C^{1,1} domain in the asymptotic
sphere give a foliation of the hyperbolic n-space. We also show that if C is a
closed codimension-1 C^{2,a} submanifold in the asymptotic sphere bounding a
unique constant mean curvature hypersurface S_H in the hyperbolic n-space with
asymptotic boundary C for any -1<H<1, then the constant mean curvature
hypersurfaces {S_H} foliates the hyperbolic n-space.
