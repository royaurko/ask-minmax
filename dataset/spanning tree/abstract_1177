We use the methods of Hedden, Juhasz, and Sarkar to exhibit a set of
arborescent knots that bound large numbers of non-isotopic minimal genus
spanning surfaces. In particular, we describe a sequence of prime knots K_{n}
which will bound at least 2^{2n-1} non-isotopic minimal spanning surfaces of
genus n.
