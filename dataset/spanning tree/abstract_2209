The properties of scale-free random trees are investigated using both
preconditioning on non-extinction and fixed size averages, in order to study
the thermodynamic limit. The scaling form of volume probability is found, the
connectivity dimensions are determined and compared with other exponents which
describe the growth. The (local) spectral dimension is also determined, through
the study of the massless limit of the Gaussian model on such trees.
