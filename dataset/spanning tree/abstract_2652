One of the main virtues of trees is to represent formal solutions of various
functional equations which can be cast in the form of fixed point problems.
Basic examples include differential equations and functional (Lagrange)
inversion in power series rings. When analyzed in terms of combinatorial Hopf
algebras, the simplest examples yield interesting algebraic identities or
enumerative results.
