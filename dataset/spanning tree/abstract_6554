The chirally improved (CI) quark propagator in Landau gauge is calculated in
two flavor lattice Quantum Chromodynamics. Its wave-function renormalization
function $Z(p^2)$ and mass function $M(p^2)$ are studied. To minimize lattice
artifacts, tree-level improvement of the propagator and tree-level correction
of the lattice dressing functions is applied. Subsequently the CI quark
propagator under Dirac operator low-mode removal is investigated. The
dynamically generated mass in the infrared domain of the mass function is found
to dissolve continuously as a function of the reduction level and strong
suppression of $Z(p^2)$ for small momenta is observed.
