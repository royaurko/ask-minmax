We consider the problem of estimating undirected triangle-free graphs of high
dimensional distributions. Triangle-free graphs form a rich graph family which
allows arbitrary loopy structures but 3-cliques. For inferential tractability,
we propose a graphical Fermat's principle to regularize the distribution
family. Such principle enforces the existence of a distribution-dependent
pseudo-metric such that any two nodes have a smaller distance than that of two
other nodes who have a geodesic path include these two nodes. Guided by this
principle, we show that a greedy strategy is able to recover the true graph.
The resulting algorithm only requires a pairwise distance matrix as input and
is computationally even more efficient than calculating the minimum spanning
tree. We consider graph estimation problems under different settings, including
discrete and nonparametric distribution families. Thorough numerical results
are provided to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method.
