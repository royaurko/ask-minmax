A selection of results from the 2010 data taking period of the ATLAS and CMS
experiments at the LHC at a proton-proton centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is
presented. These results comprise differential jet cross sections for varying
jet multiplicities, the investigation of properties of large rapidity gaps
spanned by a dijet system, the production of heavy gauge bosons together with
jets, and finally the investigations of properties of top quark pair
production.
