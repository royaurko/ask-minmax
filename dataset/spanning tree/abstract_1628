This article considers some affine algebraic varieties attached to finite
trees and closely related to cluster algebras. Their definition involves a
canonical coloring of vertices of trees into three colors. These varieties are
proved to be smooth and to admit sometimes free actions of algebraic tori. Some
results are obtained on their number of points over finite fields and on their
cohomology.
