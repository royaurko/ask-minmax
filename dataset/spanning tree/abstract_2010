Every chordal graph $G$ can be represented as the intersection graph of a
collection of subtrees of a host tree, a so-called {\em tree model} of $G$. The
leafage $\ell(G)$ of a connected chordal graph $G$ is the minimum number of
leaves of the host tree of a tree model of $G$. The vertex leafage $\vl(G)$ is
the smallest number $k$ such that there exists a tree model of $G$ in which
every subtree has at most $k$ leaves. The leafage is a polynomially computable
parameter by the result of \cite{esa}. In this contribution, we study the
vertex leafage.
  We prove for every fixed $k\geq 3$ that deciding whether the vertex leafage
of a given chordal graph is at most $k$ is NP-complete by proving a stronger
result, namely that the problem is NP-complete on split graphs with vertex
leafage of at most $k+1$. On the other hand, for chordal graphs of leafage at
most $\ell$, we show that the vertex leafage can be calculated in time
$n^{O(\ell)}$. Finally, we prove that there exists a tree model that realizes
both the leafage and the vertex leafage of $G$. Notably, for every path graph
$G$, there exists a path model with $\ell(G)$ leaves in the host tree and it
can be computed in $O(n^3)$ time.
