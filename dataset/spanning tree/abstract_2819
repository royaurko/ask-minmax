We study spanning diverging forests of a digraph and related matrices. It is
shown that the normalized matrix of out forests of a digraph coincides with the
transition matrix in a specific observation model for Markov chains related to
the digraph. Expression are given for the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse and
the group inverse of the Kirchhoff (Laplacian) matrix. These expressions
involve the matrix of maximum out forest of the digraph. Every matrix of out
forests with a fixed number of arcs and the normalized matrix of out forests
are represented as polynomials in the Kirchhoff matrix; with the help of these
identities new proofs are given for the matrix-forest theorem and some other
statements. A connection is specified between the forest dimension of a digraph
and the degree of an annihilating polynomial for the Kirchhoff (Laplacian)
matrix. Some accessibility measures for digraph vertices are considered. These
are based on the enumeration of spanning forests.
