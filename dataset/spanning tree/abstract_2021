Dengue fever is a flu-like illness spread by the bite of an infected mosquito
which is fast emerging as a major health problem. Timely and cost effective
diagnosis using clinical and laboratory features would reduce the mortality
rates besides providing better grounds for clinical management and disease
surveillance. We wish to develop a robust and effective decision tree based
approach for predicting dengue disease. Our analysis is based on the clinical
characteristics and laboratory measurements of the diseased individuals. We
have developed and trained an alternating decision tree with boosting and
compared its performance with C4.5 algorithm for dengue disease diagnosis. Of
the 65 patient records a diagnosis establishes that 53 individuals have been
confirmed to have dengue fever. An alternating decision tree based algorithm
was able to differentiate the dengue fever using the clinical and laboratory
data with number of correctly classified instances as 89%, F-measure of 0.86
and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) of 0.826 as compared to C4.5 having
correctly classified instances as 78%,h F-measure of 0.738 and ROC of 0.617
respectively. Alternating decision tree based approach with boosting has been
able to predict dengue fever with a higher degree of accuracy than C4.5 based
decision tree using simple clinical and laboratory features. Further analysis
on larger data sets is required to improve the sensitivity and specificity of
the alternating decision trees.
