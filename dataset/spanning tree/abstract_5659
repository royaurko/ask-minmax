We define the energy-momentum tensor on lattice for the $\lambda \phi^4$ and
for the nonlinear $\sigma$-model Symanzik tree-improved actions, using Ward
identities or an explicit matching procedure. The resulting operators give the
correct one loop scale anomaly, and in the case of the sigma model they can
have applications in Monte Carlo simulations.
