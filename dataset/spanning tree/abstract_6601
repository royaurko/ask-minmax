We study and solve some variations of the random K-satisfiability problem -
balanced K-SAT and biased random K-SAT - on a regular tree, using techniques we
have developed earlier(arXiv:1110.2065). In both these problems, as well as
variations of these that we have looked at, we find that the SAT-UNSAT
transition obtained on the Bethe lattice matches the exact threshold for the
same model on a random graph for K=2 and is very close to the numerical value
obtained for K=3. For higher K it deviates from the numerical estimates of the
solvability threshold on random graphs, but is very close to the dynamical
1-RSB threshold as obtained from the first non-trivial fixed point of the
survey propagation algorithm.
