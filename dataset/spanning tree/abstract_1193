The limit distribution of the total cost incurred by splitting a tree
uniformly distributed on the set of all finite free trees, appears as an
additive functional induced by a toll equal to the square of the size of tree.
The main tools used are the recent results connecting the asymptotics of
generating functions with the asymptotics of their Hadamard product, and the
method of moments.
