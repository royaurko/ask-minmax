Let $F$ be a function on pairs of vertices. An {\em $F$- labeling scheme} is
composed of a {\em marker} algorithm for labeling the vertices of a graph with
short labels, coupled with a {\em decoder} algorithm allowing one to compute
$F(u,v)$ of any two vertices $u$ and $v$ directly from their labels. As
applications for labeling schemes concern mainly large and dynamically changing
networks, it is of interest to study {\em distributed dynamic} labeling
schemes. This paper investigates labeling schemes for dynamic trees.
  This paper presents a general method for constructing labeling schemes for
dynamic trees. Our method is based on extending an existing {\em static} tree
labeling scheme to the dynamic setting. This approach fits many natural
functions on trees, such as ancestry relation, routing (in both the adversary
and the designer port models), nearest common ancestor etc.. Our resulting
dynamic schemes incur overheads (over the static scheme) on the label size and
on the communication complexity. Informally, for any function $k(n)$ and any
static $F$-labeling scheme on trees, we present an $F$-labeling scheme on
dynamic trees incurring multiplicative overhead factors
 (over the static scheme) of $O(\log_{k(n)} n)$ on the label size and
$O(k(n)\log_{k(n)} n)$ on the amortized message complexity. In particular, by
setting $k(n)=n^{\epsilon}$ for any $0<\epsilon<1$, we obtain dynamic labeling
schemes with asymptotically optimal label sizes and sublinear amortized message
complexity for all the above mentioned functions.
