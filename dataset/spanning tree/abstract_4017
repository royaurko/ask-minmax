The BCFW recursion relations provide a powerful way to compute tree
amplitudes in gauge theories and gravity, but only hold if some amplitudes
vanish when two of the momenta are taken to infinity in a particular complex
direction. This is a very surprising property, since individual Feynman
diagrams all diverge at infinite momentum. In this paper we give a simple
physical understanding of amplitudes in this limit, which corresponds to a hard
particle with (complex) light-like momentum moving in a soft background, and
can be conveniently studied using the background field method exploiting
background light-cone gauge. An important role is played by enhanced spin
symmetries at infinite momentum--a single copy of a "Lorentz" group for gauge
theory and two copies for gravity--which together with Ward identities give a
systematic expansion for amplitudes at large momentum. We use this to study
tree amplitudes in a wide variety of theories, and in particular demonstrate
that certain pure gauge and gravity amplitudes do vanish at infinity. Thus the
BCFW recursion relations can be used to compute completely general gluon and
graviton tree amplitudes in any number of dimensions. We briefly comment on the
implications of these results for computing massive 4D amplitudes by KK
reduction, as well understanding the unexpected cancelations that have recently
been found in loop-level gravity amplitudes.
