We propose a generic termination proof method for rewriting under strategies,
based on an explicit induction on the termination property. Rewriting trees on
ground terms are modeled by proof trees, generated by alternatively applying
narrowing and abstracting steps. The induction principle is applied through the
abstraction mechanism, where terms are replaced by variables representing any
of their normal forms. The induction ordering is not given a priori, but
defined with ordering constraints, incrementally set during the proof.
Abstraction constraints can be used to control the narrowing mechanism, well
known to easily diverge. The generic method is then instantiated for the
innermost, outermost and local strategies.
