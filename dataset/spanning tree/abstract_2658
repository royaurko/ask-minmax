Gauge theory amplitudes in a non-helicity format are generated at all
$n$-point and at tree level. These amplitudes inherit structure from $\phi^3$
classical scattering, and the string inspired formalism is used to find the
tensor algebra. All of the classical gravity amplitudes are also given. The
classical effective action can also be constructed. Generalizations to
amplitudes with non spin-1 or 2 is possible.
