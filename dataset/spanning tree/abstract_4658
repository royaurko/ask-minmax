We study the topological charge and the topological susceptibility in lattice
QCD with two degenerate flavors of naive Wilson fermions at two values of
lattice spacings and different volumes, for a range of quark masses.
Configurations are generated with DDHMC/HMC algorithms and smoothened with HYP
smearing. We present integrated autocorrelation time for both topological
charge and topological susceptibility at the two lattice spacing values
studied. The spanning of different topological sectors as a function of the
hopping parameter kappa is presented. The expected chiral behaviour of the
topological susceptibility (including finite volume dependence) is observed.
