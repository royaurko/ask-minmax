We consider the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph process, which is a stochastic
process that starts with $n$ vertices and no edges, and at each step adds one
new edge chosen uniformly at random from the set of missing edges. Let
$\mathcal{G}(n,m)$ be a graph with $m$ edges obtained after $m$ steps of this
process. Each edge $e_i$ ($i=1,2,..., m$) of $\mathcal{G}(n,m)$ independently
chooses precisely $k \in \mathbb{N}$ colours, uniformly at random, from a given
set of $n-1$ colours (one may view $e_i$ as a multi-edge). We stop the process
prematurely at time $M$ when the following two events hold: $\mathcal{G}(n,M)$
is connected and every colour occurs at least once ($M={n \choose 2}$ if some
colour does not occur before all edges are present; however, this does not
happen asymptotically almost surely). The question addressed in this paper is
whether $\mathcal{G}(n,M)$ has a rainbow spanning tree (that is, multicoloured
tree on $n$ vertices). Clearly, both properties are necessary for the desired
tree to exist.
  In 1994, Frieze and McKay investigated the case $k=1$ and the answer to this
question is "yes" (asymptotically almost surely). However, since the sharp
threshold for connectivity is $\frac {n}{2} \log n$ and the sharp threshold for
seeing all the colours is $\frac{n}{k} \log n$, the case $k=2$ is of special
importance as in this case the two processes keep up with one another. In this
paper, we show that asymptotically almost surely the answer is "yes" also for
$k \ge 2$.
