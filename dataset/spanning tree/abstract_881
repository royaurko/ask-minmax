The deletion--contraction algorithm is perhaps the most popular method for
computing a host of fundamental graph invariants such as the chromatic, flow,
and reliability polynomials in graph theory, the Jones polynomial of an
alternating link in knot theory, and the partition functions of the models of
Ising, Potts, and Fortuin--Kasteleyn in statistical physics. Prior to this
work, deletion--contraction was also the fastest known general-purpose
algorithm for these invariants, running in time roughly proportional to the
number of spanning trees in the input graph. Here, we give a substantially
faster algorithm that computes the Tutte polynomial--and hence, all the
aforementioned invariants and more--of an arbitrary graph in time within a
polynomial factor of the number of connected vertex sets. The algorithm
actually evaluates a multivariate generalization of the Tutte polynomial by
making use of an identity due to Fortuin and Kasteleyn. We also provide a
polynomial-space variant of the algorithm and give an analogous result for
Chung and Graham's cover polynomial. An implementation of the algorithm
outperforms deletion--contraction also in practice.
