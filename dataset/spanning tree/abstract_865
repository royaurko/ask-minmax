We use the new minimum spanning tree (MST) method to look for mass
segregation in the Taurus association. The method computes the ratio of MST
lengths of any chosen subset of objects, including the most massive stars and
brown dwarfs, to the MST lengths of random sets of stars and brown dwarfs in
the cluster. This mass segregation ratio (Lambda_MSR) enables a quantitative
measure of the spatial distribution of high-mass and low-mass stars, and brown
dwarfs to be made in Taurus.
  We find that the most massive stars in Taurus are inversely mass segregated,
with Lambda_MSR = 0.70 +/- 0.10 (Lambda_MSR = 1 corresponds to no mass
segregation), which differs from the strong mass segregation signatures found
in more dense and massive clusters such as Orion. The brown dwarfs in Taurus
are not mass segregated, although we find evidence that some low-mass stars
are, with an Lambda_MSR = 1.25 +/- 0.15. Finally, we compare our results to
previous measures of the spatial distribution of stars and brown dwarfs in
Taurus, and briefly discuss their implications.
