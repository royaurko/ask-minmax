In this paper, we define a new kind of weighted tree automata where the
weights are only supported by final states. We show that these automata are
sequentializable and we study their closures under classical regular and
algebraic operations. We then use these automata to compute the subtree kernel
of two finite tree languages in an efficient way. Finally, we present some
perspectives involving the root-weighted tree automata.
