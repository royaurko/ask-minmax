In this paper we examine the relationship between hyperconvex hulls and
metric trees. After providing a linking construction for hyperconvex spaces, we
show that the four-point property is inherited by the hyperconvex hull, which
leads to the theorem that every complete metric tree is hyperconvex. We also
consider some extension theorems for these spaces.
