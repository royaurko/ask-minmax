We study probability distributions of waves of topplings in the
Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld model on hypercubic lattices for dimensions D>=2. Waves
represent relaxation processes which do not contain multiple toppling events.
We investigate bulk and boundary waves by means of their correspondence to
spanning trees, and by extensive numerical simulations. While the scaling
behavior of avalanches is complex and usually not governed by simple scaling
laws, we show that the probability distributions for waves display clear power
law asymptotic behavior in perfect agreement with the analytical predictions.
Critical exponents are obtained for the distributions of radius, area, and
duration, of bulk and boundary waves. Relations between them and fractal
dimensions of waves are derived. We confirm that the upper critical dimension
D_u of the model is 4, and calculate logarithmic corrections to the scaling
behavior of waves in D=4. In addition we present analytical estimates for bulk
avalanches in dimensions D>=4 and simulation data for avalanches in D<=3. For
D=2 they seem not easy to interpret.
