In this note, we calculate the leading term of the rational lift of the
Kontsevich integral, introduced by Garoufalidis and Kricker, on the boundary of
an embedded grope of class 2n. We observe that it lies in the subspace spanned
by connected diagrams of Euler degree 2n-2 which have a bead t-1 on a single
edge. This places severe algebraic restrictions on the sort of knots that can
bound gropes, and in particular implies the two main results of the contributor's
thesis, at least over the rationals.
