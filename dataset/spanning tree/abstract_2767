We analyze the distribution of PageRank on a directed configuration model and
show that as the size of the graph grows to infinity it can be closely
approximated by the PageRank of the root node of an appropriately constructed
tree. This tree approximation is in turn related to the solution of a linear
stochastic fixed point equation that has been thoroughly studied in the recent
literature.
