We introduce the concept of 'dynamical phase coexistence' to provide a simple
solution for a long-standing problem in theoretical ecology, the so-called
"savanna problem". The challenge is to understand why in savanna ecosystems
trees and grasses coexist in a robust way with large spatio-temporal
variability. We propose a simple model, a variant of the Contact Process (CP),
which includes two key extra features: varying external
(environmental/rainfall) conditions and tree age. The system fluctuates locally
between a woodland and a grassland phase, corresponding to the active and
absorbing phases of the underlying pure contact process. This leads to a highly
variable stable phase characterized by patches of the woodland and grassland
phases coexisting dynamically. We show that the mean time to tree extinction
under this model increases as a power-law of system size and can be of the
order of 10,000,000 years in even moderately sized savannas. Finally, we
demonstrate that while local interactions among trees may influence tree
spatial distribution and the order of the transition between woodland and
grassland phases, they do not affect dynamical coexistence. We expect dynamical
coexistence to be relevant in other contexts in physics, biology or the social
sciences.
