A simple sql statement can be used to search learning or rule in relational
database for data mining purposes particularly for classification rule. With
just only one simple sql statement, characteristic and classification rule can
be created simultaneously. Collaboration sql statement with any other
application software will increase the ability for creating t-weight as
measurement the typicality of each record in the characteristic rule and
d-weight as measurement the discriminating behavior of the learned
classification/discriminant rule, specifically for further generalization in
characteristic rule. Handling concept hierarchy into tables based on concept
tree will influence for the successful simple sql statement and by knowing the
right standard knowledge to transform each of concept tree in concept hierarchy
into one table as to transform concept hierarchy into table, the simple sql
statement can be run properly.
