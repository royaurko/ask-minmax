In this paper, we investigate tree-level scattering amplitude relations in
$U(N)$ non-linear sigma model. We use Cayley parametrization. As was shown in
the recent works [23,24] both on-shell amplitudes and off-shell currents with
odd points have to vanish under Cayley parametrization. We prove the off-shell
$U(1)$ identity and fundamental BCJ relation for even-point currents. By taking
the on-shell limits of the off-shell relations, we show that the color-ordered
tree amplitudes with even points satisfy $U(1)$-decoupling identity and
fundamental BCJ relation, which have the same formations within Yang-Mills
theory. We further state that all the on-shell general KK, BCJ relations as
well as the minimal-basis expansion are also satisfied by color-ordered tree
amplitudes. As a consequence of the relations among color-ordered amplitudes,
the total $2m$-point tree amplitudes satisfy DDM form of color decomposition as
well as KLT relation.
