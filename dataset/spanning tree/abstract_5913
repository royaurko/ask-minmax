In the paper arguments are given why the concept of static evaluation has the
potential to be a useful extension to Monte Carlo tree search. A new concept of
modeling static evaluation through a dynamical system is introduced and
strengths and weaknesses are discussed. The general suitability of this
approach is demonstrated.
