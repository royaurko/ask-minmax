Theoretical analysis proves that human survivability is dominated by an
unusual physical, rather than biological, mechanism, which yields an exact law.
The law agrees with all experimental data, but, contrary to existing theories,
it is the same for an entire species, i.e., it is independent of the
population, its phenotypes, environment and history. The law implies that the
survivability changes with environment via phase transitions, which are
simultaneous for all generations. They allow for a rapid (within few percent of
the life span) and significant increase in the life expectancy even above its
value at a much earlier age.
