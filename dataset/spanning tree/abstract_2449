For a particular case of branching random walk with lattice support, namely
the Yule process, we prove that the distribution of the centred maximum
oscillates around a distribution (corresponding to a critical travelling wave)
in the following sense: there exist continuous functions $t \mapsto a_t$ and $x
\mapsto \phi_{\max}(x)$ such that:
  $$\lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} \vert
\mathbb{P}(X_{\max}(t) \leq a_t +x )-\phi_{\max}(x- \{ a_t +x\})\vert=0,$$
where $\{x\}=x-\lfloor x \rfloor$. This process is classically related to the
binary search tree, thus yielding similar results for the height and for the
saturation level of the binary search tree too.
