We study the equivalence relation on states of labelled transition systems of
satisfying the same formulas in Computation Tree Logic without the next state
modality (CTL-X). This relation is obtained by De Nicola & Vaandrager by
translating labelled transition systems to Kripke structures, while lifting the
totality restriction on the latter. They characterised it as divergence
sensitive branching bisimulation equivalence.
  We find that this equivalence fails to be a congruence for interleaving
parallel composition. The reason is that the proposed application of CTL-X to
non-total Kripke structures lacks the expressiveness to cope with deadlock
properties that are important in the context of parallel composition. We
propose an extension of CTL-X, or an alternative treatment of non-totality,
that fills this hiatus. The equivalence induced by our extension is
characterised as branching bisimulation equivalence with explicit divergence,
which is, moreover, shown to be the coarsest congruence contained in divergence
sensitive branching bisimulation equivalence.
