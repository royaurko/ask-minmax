In this paper we verify the Strauss conjecture for semilinear wave equations
on asymptotically Euclidean manifolds when n=3,4, we also give an almost sharp
life span for the subcritical case $2\le p<p_c$ when n=3. The main ingredients
include a KSS type estimate with $0<\mu<1/2$ and weighted Strichartz estimates
of order two.
