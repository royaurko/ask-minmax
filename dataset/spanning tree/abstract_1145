Multi-edge trees as introduced in a recent paper of Dziemia\'nczuk are plane
trees where multiple edges are allowed. We first show that $d$-ary multi-edge
trees where the out-degrees are bounded by $d$ are in bijection with classical
$d$-ary trees. This allows us to analyse parameters such as the height.
  The main part of this paper is concerned with multi-edge trees counted by
their number of edges. The distribution of the number of vertices as well as
the height are analysed asymptotically.
