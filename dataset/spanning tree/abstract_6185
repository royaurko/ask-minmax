We investigate numerically and analytically Potts models on ``thin'' random
graphs -- generic Feynman diagrams, using the idea that such models may be
expressed as the N --> 1 limit of a matrix model. The thin random graphs in
this limit are locally tree-like, in distinction to the ``fat'' random graphs
that appear in the planar Feynman diagram limit, more familiar from discretized
models of two dimensional gravity.
  The interest of the thin graphs is that they give mean field theory behaviour
for spin models living on them without infinite range interactions or the
boundary problems of genuine tree-like structures such as the Bethe lattice.
q-state Potts models display a first order transition in the mean field for
q>2, so the thin graph Potts models provide a useful test case for exploring
discontinuous transitions in mean field theories in which many quantities can
be calculated explicitly in the saddle point approximation.
