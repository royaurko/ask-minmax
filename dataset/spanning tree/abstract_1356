The MULTICUT IN TREES problem consists in deciding, given a tree, a set of
requests (i.e. paths in the tree) and an integer k, whether there exists a set
of k edges cutting all the requests. This problem was shown to be FPT by Guo
and Niedermeyer. They also provided an exponential kernel. They asked whether
this problem has a polynomial kernel. This question was also raised by Fellows.
We show that MULTICUT IN TREES has a polynomial kernel.
