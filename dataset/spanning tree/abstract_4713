We report on the development of a frequency modulatable 795 nm semiconductor
laser based on self-injection locking to a high quality factor whispering
gallery mode microresonator. The laser is characterized with residual amplitude
modulation below -80 dB and frequency noise better than 300 Hz/Hz^(1/2) at
offset frequencies ranging from 100 Hz to 10 MHz. The frequency modulation (FM)
speed and span of the laser exceed 1 MHz and 4 GHz, respectively. Locking of
the laser to Doppler-free saturated absorption resonance of 87Rb D1 line is
demonstrated and frequency stability below 10^(-12) is measured for integration
time spanning from 1 s to 1 day. The architecture demonstrated in this study is
suitable for realization of frequency modulatable lasers at any wavelength.
