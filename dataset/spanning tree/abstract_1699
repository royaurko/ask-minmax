We investigate a neutral model for speciation and extinction, the constant
rate birth-death process. The process is conditioned to have $n$ extant species
today, we look at the tree distribution of the reconstructed trees-- i.e. the
trees without the extinct species. Whereas the tree shape distribution is
well-known and actually the same as under the pure birth process, no analytic
results for the speciation times were known. We provide the distribution for
the speciation times and calculate the expectations analytically. This
characterizes the reconstructed trees completely. We will show how the results
can be used to date phylogenies.
