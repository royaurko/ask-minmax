A system is presented that segments, clusters and predicts musical audio in
an unsupervised manner, adjusting the number of (timbre) clusters
instantaneously to the audio input. A sequence learning algorithm adapts its
structure to a dynamically changing clustering tree. The flow of the system is
as follows: 1) segmentation by onset detection, 2) timbre representation of
each segment by Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients, 3) discretization by
incremental clustering, yielding a tree of different sound classes (e.g.
instruments) that can grow or shrink on the fly driven by the instantaneous
sound events, resulting in a discrete symbol sequence, 4) extraction of
statistical regularities of the symbol sequence, using hierarchical N-grams and
the newly introduced conceptual Boltzmann machine, and 5) prediction of the
next sound event in the sequence. The system's robustness is assessed with
respect to complexity and noisiness of the signal. Clustering in isolation
yields an adjusted Rand index (ARI) of 82.7% / 85.7% for data sets of singing
voice and drums. Onset detection jointly with clustering achieve an ARI of
81.3% / 76.3% and the prediction of the entire system yields an ARI of 27.2% /
39.2%.
