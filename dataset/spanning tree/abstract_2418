We present a new package in R implementing Bayesian additive regression trees
(BART). The package introduces many new features for data analysis using BART
such as variable selection, interaction detection, model diagnostic plots,
incorporation of missing data and the ability to save trees for future
prediction. It is significantly faster than the current R implementation,
parallelized, and capable of handling both large sample sizes and
high-dimensional data.
