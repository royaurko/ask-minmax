Various questions on Lie ideals of C*-algebras are investigated. They fall
roughly under the following topics: relation of Lie ideals to closed two-sided
ideals; Lie ideals spanned by special classes of elements such as commutators,
nilpotents, and the range of polynomials; characterization of Lie ideals as
similarity invariant subspaces.
