This paper presents an optimal strategy for solving the 4 peg-7 color
Mastermind MM(4,7) in the expected case (4.676) along with optimal strategies
or upper bounds for other values. The program developed is using a depth-first
branch and bound algorithm relying on tight upper bound, dynamic lower bound
evaluation and guess equivalence to prune symmetric tree branches.
