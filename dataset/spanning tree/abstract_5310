We show that operations in Milnor K-theory mod $p$ of a field are spanned by
divided power operations. After giving an explicit formula for divided power
operations and extending them to some new cases, we determine for all fields
$k$ and all prime numbers $p$, all the operations $K^M_i/p \to K^M_j/p$
commuting with field extensions over the base field $k$. Moreover, the integral
case is discussed and we determine the operations $K^M_i/p \to K^M_j/p$ for
smooth schemes over a field.
