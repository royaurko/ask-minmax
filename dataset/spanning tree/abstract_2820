A family of maps or flows depending on a parameter $\nu$ which varies in an
interval, spans a certain property if along the interval this property depends
continuously on the parameter and achieves some asymptotic values along it. We
consider families of periodically forced Hamiltonian systems for which the
appropriately scaled frequency $\bar{\omega}(\nu)$ is spanned, namely it covers
the semi-infinite line $[0,\infty).$ Under some natural assumptions on the
family of flows and its adiabatic limit, we construct a convenient labelling
scheme for the primary homoclinic orbits which may undergo a countable number
of bifurcations along this interval. Using this scheme we prove that a properly
defined flux function is $C^{1}$ in $\nu.$ Combining this proof with previous
results of RK and Poje, immediately establishes that the flux function and the
size of the chaotic zone depend on the frequency in a non-monotone fashion for
a large class of Hamiltonian flows.
