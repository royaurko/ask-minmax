We study scattering amplitudes of higher spin closed-string states off
D-branes. For states in the `first Regge trajectory' we find remarkable
simplifications both at tree level and at one loop. We discuss the high energy
behavior in the Regge limit and comment on the validity of the eikonal
approximation in this regime.
