Macro tree transducers (mtts) are a useful formal model for XML query and
transformation languages. In this paper one of the fundamental decision
problems on translations, namely the "translation membership problem" is
studied for mtts. For a fixed translation, the translation membership problem
asks whether a given input/output pair is element of the translation. For
call-by-name mtts this problem is shown to be NP-complete. The main result is
that translation membership for call-by-value mtts is in polynomial time. For
several extensions, such as addition of regular look-ahead or the
generalization to multi-return mtts, it is shown that translation membership
still remains in PTIME.
