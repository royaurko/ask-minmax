Given a metric space $X$ of finite asymptotic dimension, we consider a
quasi-isometric invariant of the space called dimension function. The space is
said to have asymptotic Assouad-Nagata dimension less or equal $n$ if there is
a linear dimension function in this dimension. We prove that if $X$ is a
tree-graded space (as introduced by C. Drutu and M. Sapir) and for some
positive integer $n$ a function $f$ serves as an $n$-dimensional dimension
function for all pieces of $X$, then the function $300\cdot f$ serves as an
$n$-dimensional dimension function for $X$. As a corollary we find a formula
for the asymptotic Assouad-Nagata dimension of the free product of finitely
generated infinite groups: $asdim_{AN} (G*H)= max\{asdim_{AN} (G), asdim_{AN}
(H)\}.$
