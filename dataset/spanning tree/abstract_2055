We investigate compactness properties of weighted summation operators
$V_{\alpha,\sigma}$ as mapping from $\ell_1(T)$ into $\ell_q(T)$ for some $q\in
(1,\infty)$. Those operators are defined by $$ (V_{\alpha,\sigma} x)(t)
:=\alpha(t)\sum_{s\succeq t}\sigma(s) x(s)\,,\quad t\in T\;, $$ where $T$ is a
tree with induced partial order $t \preceq s$ (or $s \succeq t$) for $t,s\in
T$. Here $\alpha$ and $\sigma$ are given weights on $T$. We introduce a metric
$d$ on $T$ such that compactness properties of $(T,d)$ imply two--sided
estimates for $e_n(V_{\alpha,\sigma})$, the (dyadic) entropy numbers of
$V_{\alpha,\sigma}$. The results are applied for concrete trees as e.g.
moderate increasing, biased or binary trees and for weights with
$\alpha(t)\sigma(t)$ decreasing either polynomially or exponentially. We also
give some probabilistic applications for Gaussian summation schemes on trees.
