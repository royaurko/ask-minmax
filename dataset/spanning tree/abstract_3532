We consider radial tree extensions of one-dimensional quasi-periodic
Schroedinger operators and establish the stability of their absolutely
continuous spectra under weak but extensive perturbations by a random
potential. The sufficiency criterion for that is the existence of Bloch-Floquet
states for the one dimensional operator corresponding to the radial problem.
