A fully threaded tree (FTT) for adaptive refinement of regular meshes is
described. By using a tree threaded at all levels, tree traversals for finding
nearest neighbors are avoided. All operations on a tree including tree
modifications are O(N), where N is a number of cells, and are performed in
parallel. An efficient implementation of the tree is described that requires 2N
words of memory. A filtering algorithm for removing high-frequency noise during
mesh refinement is described.
  A FTT can be used in various numerical applications. In this paper, it is
applied to the integration of the Euler equations of fluid dynamics. An
adaptive-mesh time stepping algorithm is described in which different time
steps are used at different levels of the tree. Time stepping and mesh
refinement are interleaved to avoid extensive buffer layers of fine mesh which
were otherwise required ahead of moving shocks. Test examples are presented,
and the FTT performance is evaluated. The three-dimensional simulation of the
interaction of a shock wave and a spherical bubble is carried out that shows
the development of azimuthal perturbations on the bubble surface.
