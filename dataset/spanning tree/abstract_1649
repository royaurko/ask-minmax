An influence of the weak microlensing effect on the pulsar timing is
investigated for pulsar B1937+21. Average residuals of Time of Arrival (TOA)
due to the effect would be as large as 10 ns in 20 years observation span.
These residuals can be much greater (up to 1 ms in 20 years span) if pulsar is
located in globular cluster (or behind it).
