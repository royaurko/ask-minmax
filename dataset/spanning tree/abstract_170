We study the relation between the minimal spanning tree (MST) on many random
points and the "near-minimal" tree which is optimal subject to the constraint
that a proportion $\delta$ of its edges must be different from those of the
MST. Heuristics suggest that, regardless of details of the probability model,
the ratio of lengths should scale as $1 + \Theta(\delta^2)$. We prove this
scaling result in the model of the lattice with random edge-lengths and in the
Euclidean model.
