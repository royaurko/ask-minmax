We introduce a technique to filter out complex data-sets by extracting a
subgraph of representative links. Such a filtering can be tuned up to any
desired level by controlling the genus of the resulting graph. We show that
this technique is especially suitable for correlation based graphs giving
filtered graphs which preserve the hierarchical organization of the minimum
spanning tree but containing a larger amount of information in their internal
structure. In particular in the case of planar filtered graphs (genus equal to
0) triangular loops and 4 element cliques are formed. The application of this
filtering procedure to 100 stocks in the USA equity markets shows that such
loops and cliques have important and significant relations with the market
structure and properties.
