We introduce the warping polynomial of an oriented knot diagram. In this
paper, we characterize the warping polynomial, and define the span of a knot to
be the minimal span of the warping polynomial for all diagrams of the knot. We
show that the span of a knot is one if and only if it is non-trivial and
alternating, and we give an inequality between the span and the dealternating
number.
