A true Tree Calculus is being developed to make a joint study of the two
statistics "eoc" (end of minimal chain) and "pom" (parent of maximum leaf) on
the set of secant trees. Their joint distribution restricted to the set
{eoc-pom<= 1} is shown to satisfy two partial difference equation systems, to
be symmetric and to be expressed in the form of an explicit three-variable
generating function.
