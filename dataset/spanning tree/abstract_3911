We consider translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures (TISGMs) for the
$q$-state Potts model on a Cayley tree. Recently a full description of the
TISGMs was obtained, and it was shown in particular that at sufficiently low
temperatures their number is $2^{q}-1$. In this paper for each TISGM $\mu$ we
explicitly give the set of boundary conditions such that limiting Gibbs
measures with respect to these boundary conditions coincide with $\mu$.
