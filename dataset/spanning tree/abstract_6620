A set-operad is a monoid in the category of combinatorial species with
respect to the operation of substitution. From a set-operad, we give here a
simple construction of a Hopf algebra that we call {\em the natural Hopf
algebra} of the operad. We obtain a combinatorial formula for its antipode in
terms of Shr\"oder trees, generalizing the Hayman-Schmitt formula for the Fa\'a
di Bruno Hopf algebra. From there we derive more readable formulas for specific
operads. The classical Lagrange inversion formula is obtained in this way from
the set-operad of pointed sets. We also derive antipodes formulas for the
natural Hopf algebra corresponding to the operads of connected graphs, the NAP
operad, and for its generalization, the set-operad of trees enriched with a
monoid. When the set operad is left cancellative, we can construct a family of
posets. The natural Hopf algebra is then obtained as an incidence reduced Hopf
algebra, by taking a suitable equivalence relation over the intervals of that
family of posets. We also present a simple combinatorial construction of an
epimorphism from the natural Hopf algebra corresponding to the NAP operad, to
the Connes and Kreimer Hopf algebra.
