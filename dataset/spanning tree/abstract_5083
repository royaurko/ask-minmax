We study the influence of vacancy concentration on the behaviour of the three
dimensional Random Field Ising model with metastable dynamics. We focus our
analysis on the number of spanning avalanches which allows for a clean
determination of the critical line where the hysteresis loops change from
continuous to discontinuous. By a detailed finite size scaling analysis we
determine the phase diagram and prove numerically the critical exponents along
the whole critical line. Finally we discuss the origin of the curvature of the
critical line at high vacancy concentration.
