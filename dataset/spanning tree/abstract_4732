We answer a number of open problems concerning phase retrieval and phase
retrieval by projections. In particular, one main theorem classifies phase
retrieval by projections via collections of sequences of vectors allowing norm
retrieval. Another key result computes the minimal number of vectors needed to
add to a frame in order for it to possess the complement property and hence
allow phase retrieval. In furthering this idea, in a third main theorem we show
that when a collection of subspaces is one subspace short from allowing phase
retrieval, then any partition of orthonormal bases from these subspaces into
two sets which fail to span, then each spans a hyperplane. We offer many more
results in this area as well as provide a large number of examples showing the
limitations of the theory.
