In this paper we consider the problem of connected edge searching of weighted
trees. It is shown that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for finding
optimal connected search strategy for bounded degree trees with arbitrary
weights on the edges and vertices of the tree. The problem is NP-complete for
general node-weighted trees (the weight of each edge is 1).
