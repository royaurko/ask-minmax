We calculate the string tension, deconfinement transition temperature and
bulk thermodynamic quantities of the SU(3) gauge theory using tree level and
tadpole improved actions. Finite temperature calculations have been performed
on lattices with temporal extent N_tau = 3 and 4. Compared to calculations with
the standard Wilson action on this size lattices we observe a drastic reduction
of the cut-off dependence of bulk thermodynamic observables at high
temperatures. In order to test the influence of improvement on long-distance
observables at T_c we determine the ratio T_c/sqrt(sigma). For all actions,
including the standard Wilson action, we find results which differ only little
from each other. We do, however, observe an improved asymptotic scaling
behaviour for the tadpole improved action compared to the Wilson and tree level
improved actions.
