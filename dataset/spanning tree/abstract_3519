An approach, based on the Smith Normal Form, is introduced to study the
spectra of symmetric matrices with a given graph. The approach serves well to
explain how the path cover number (resp. diameter of a tree T) is related to
the maximum multiplicity occurring for an eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix
whose graph is T (resp. the minimum number q(T) of distinct eigenvalues over
the symmetric matrices whose graphs are T). The approach is also applied to a
more general class of connected graphs G, not necessarily trees, in order to
establish a lower bound on q(G).
