In this paper we present a multilayer particle deposition model on a random
tree. We derive the time dependent densities of the first and second layer
analytically and show that in all trees the limiting density of the first layer
exceeds the density in the second layer. We also provide a procedure to
calculate higher layer densities and prove that random trees have a higher
limiting density in the first layer than regular trees. Finally, we compare
densities between the first and second layer and between regular and random
trees.
