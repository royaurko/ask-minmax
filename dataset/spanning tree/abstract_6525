We present a new perfect simulation algorithm for stationary chains having
unbounded variable length memory. This is the class of infnite memory chains
for which the family of transition probabilities is represented by a
probabilistic context tree. We do not assume any continuity condition: our
condition is expressed in terms of the structure of the context tree. More
precisely, the length of the contexts is a deterministic function of the
distance to the last occurrence of some determined string of symbols. It turns
out that the resulting class of chains can be seen as a natural extension of
the class of chains having a renewal string. In particular, our chains exhibit
a visible regeneration scheme.
