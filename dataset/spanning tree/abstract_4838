In this article a first step is made towards the extension of
Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) tree level on-shell recursion relations to
integrands and integrals of scattering amplitudes to arbitrary loop order.
Surprisingly, it is shown that the large BCFW shift limit of the integrands has
the same structure as the corresponding tree level amplitude in any minimally
coupled Yang-Mills theory in four or more dimensions. This implies that these
integrands can be reconstructed from a subset of their `single cuts'. The main
tool is powercounting Feynman graphs in a special lightcone gauge choice
employed earlier at tree level by Arkani-Hamed and Kaplan. The relation between
shifts of integrands and shifts of its integrals is investigated explicitly at
one loop. Two particular sources of discrepancy between the integral and
integrand are identified related to UV and IR divergences. This is
cross-checked with known results for helicity equal amplitudes at one loop. The
nature of the on-shell residue at each of the single-cut singularities of the
integrand is commented upon. Several natural conjectures and opportunities for
further research present themselves.
