Consider the generalized iterated wreath product $\mathbb{Z}_{r_1}\wr
\mathbb{Z}_{r_2}\wr \ldots \wr \mathbb{Z}_{r_k}$. The number of irreducible
representations of the generalized iterated wreath product satisfies a certain
recursion, which coincides with the number of certain rooted trees. We give the
dimension of irreducible representations of the generalized iterated wreath
product and literature's fastest FFT upper bound estimate to date.
