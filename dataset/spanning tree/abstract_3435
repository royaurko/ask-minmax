We calculate the energy of electroweak sphalerons including one-loop
fermionic corrections. This calculation has previously been done by adding the
correction to the tree-level sphaleron and interpreting the resulting energy as
the 1-loop energy. However, in this paper we calculate the energy by doing a
full renormalisation of the parameters on 1-loop-level and redetermining the
sphaleron configuration using the full energy functional. When comparing the
final result with the tree-level solution we find that the 1-loop calculation
will only cause small deviations of the sphaleron energy.
