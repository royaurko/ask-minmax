We consider the wavelet transform of a finite, rooted, node-ranked, $p$-way
tree, focusing on the case of binary ($p = 2$) trees. We study a Haar wavelet
transform on this tree. Wavelet transforms allow for multiresolution analysis
through translation and dilation of a wavelet function. We explore how this
works in our tree context.
