Existing compact routing schemes, e.g., Thorup and Zwick [SPAA 2001] and
Chechik [PODC 2013], often have no means to tolerate failures, once the system
has been setup and started. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first
self-healing compact routing scheme. Besides, our schemes are developed for low
memory nodes, i.e., nodes need only $O(\log^2 n)$ memory, and are thus, compact
schemes.
  We introduce two algorithms of independent interest: The first is CompactFT,
a novel compact version (using only $O(\log n)$ local memory) of the
self-healing algorithm Forgiving Tree of Hayes et al. [PODC 2008]. The second
algorithm (CompactFTZ) combines CompactFT with Thorup-Zwick's tree-based
compact routing scheme [SPAA 2001] to produce a fully compact self-healing
routing scheme. In the self-healing model, the adversary deletes nodes one at a
time with the affected nodes self-healing locally by adding few edges.
CompactFT recovers from each attack in only $O(1)$ time and $\Delta$ messages,
with only +3 degree increase and $O(log \Delta)$ graph diameter increase, over
any sequence of deletions ($\Delta$ is the initial maximum degree).
  Additionally, CompactFTZ guarantees delivery of a packet sent from sender s
as long as the receiver t has not been deleted, with only an additional $O(y
\log \Delta)$ latency, where $y$ is the number of nodes that have been deleted
on the path between $s$ and $t$. If $t$ has been deleted, $s$ gets informed and
the packet removed from the network.
