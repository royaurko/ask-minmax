We present an application of a particular machine-learning method (Boosted
Decision Trees, BDTs using AdaBoost) to separate stars and galaxies in
photometric images using their catalog characteristics. BDTs are a well
established machine learning technique used for classification purposes. They
have been widely used specially in the field of particle and astroparticle
physics, and we use them here in an optical astronomy application. This
algorithm is able to improve from simple thresholding cuts on standard
separation variables that may be affected by local effects such as blending,
badly calculated background levels or which do not include information in other
bands. The improvements are shown using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
Release 9, with respect to the type photometric classifier. We obtain an
improvement in the impurity of the galaxy sample of a factor 2-4 for this
particular dataset, adjusting for the same efficiency of the selection. Another
main goal of this study is to verify the effects that different input vectors
and training sets have on the classification performance, the results being of
wider use to other machine learning techniques.
