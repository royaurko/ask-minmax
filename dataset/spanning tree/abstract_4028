We introduce a class of spaces, called real cubings, and study the stucture
of groups acting nicely on these spaces. Just as cubings are a natural
generalisation of simplicial trees, real cubings can be regarded as a natural
generalisation of real trees. Our main result states that a finitely generated
group $G$ acts nicely (essentially freely and co-specially) on a real cubing if
and only if it is a subgroup of a graph tower (a higher dimensional
generalisation of $\omega$-residually free towers and NTQ-groups). It follows
that $G$ acts freely, essentially freely and co-specially on a real cubing if
and only if $G$ is a subgroup of the graph product of cyclic and
(non-exceptional) surface groups. In the particular case when the real cubing
is a tree, it follows that $G$ acts freely, essentially freely and co-specially
on the real cubing if and only if it is a subgroup of the free product of
abelian and surface groups. Hence, our main result can be regarded as a
generalisation of the Rips' theorem on free actions on real trees.
  We apply our results to obtain a characterisation of limit groups over
partially commutative groups as subgroups of graph towers. This result
generalises the work of Kharlampovich-Miasnikov, \cite{KhMNull}, Sela,
\cite{Sela1} and Champetier-Guirardel, \cite{CG} on limit groups over free
groups.
