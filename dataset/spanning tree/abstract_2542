We consider a random forest $\mathcal{F}^*$, defined as a sequence of i.i.d.
birth-death (BD) trees, each started at time 0 from a single ancestor, stopped
at the first tree having survived up to a fixed time $T$. We denote by
$\left(\xi^*_t,\ 0\leq t\leq T\right)$ the population size process associated
to this forest, and we prove that if the BD trees are supercritical, then the
time-reversed process $\left(\xi^*_{T-t},\ 0\leq t\leq T\right)$, has the same
distribution as $\left(\widetilde\xi^*_t,\ 0\leq t\leq T\right)$, the
corresponding population size process of an equally defined forest
$\widetilde{\mathcal{F}}^*$, but where the underlying BD trees are subcritical,
obtained by swapping birth and death rates or equivalently, conditioning on
ultimate extinction.
  We generalize this result to splitting trees (i.e. life durations of
individuals are not necessarily exponential), provided that the i.i.d.
lifetimes of the ancestors have a specific explicit distribution, different
from that of their descendants. The results are based on an identity between
the contour of these random forests truncated up to $T$ and the duality
property of L\'evy processes. This identity allows us to also derive other
useful properties such as the distribution of the population size process
conditional on the reconstructed tree of individuals alive at $T$, which has
potential applications in epidemiology.
