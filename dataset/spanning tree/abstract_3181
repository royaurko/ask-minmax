We develop a mathematical model for sap exudation in a maple tree that is
based on a purely physical mechanism for internal pressure generation in trees
in the leafless state. There has been a long-standing controversy in the tree
physiology literature over precisely what mechanism drives sap exudation, and
we aim to cast light on this issue. Our model is based on the work of Milburn
and O'Malley [Can. J. Bot., 62(10):2101-2106, 1984] who hypothesized that
elevated sap pressures derive from compressed gas that is trapped within
certain wood cells and subsequently released when frozen sap thaws in the
spring. We also incorporate the extension of Tyree [in Tree Sap, pp. 37-45,
eds. M. Terazawa et al., Hokkaido Univ. Press, 1995] who argued that gas
bubbles are prevented from dissolving because of osmotic pressure that derives
from differences in sap sugar concentrations and the selective permeability of
cell walls. We derive a system of differential-algebraic equations based on
conservation principles that is used to test the validity of the
Milburn-O'Malley hypothesis and also to determine the extent to which osmosis
is required. This work represents the first attempt to derive a detailed
mathematical model of sap exudation at the micro-scale.
