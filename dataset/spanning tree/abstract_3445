We show that in two Higgs doublet models at tree-level the potential minimum
preserving electric charge and CP symmetries, when it exists, is the global
one. Furthermore, we derived a very simple condition, involving only the
coefficients of the quartic terms of the potential, that guarantees spontaneous
CP breaking.
