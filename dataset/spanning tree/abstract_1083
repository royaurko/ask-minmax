We present Trimble's definition of a tetracategory and prove that the spans
in (strict) 2-categories with certain limits have the structure of a monoidal
tricategory, defined as a one-object tetracategory. We recall some notions of
limits in 2-categories for use in the construction of the monoidal tricategory
of spans.
