In this paper we present an algorithm to reduce the area of a surface spanned
by a finite number of boundary curves by initiating a variational improvement
in the surface. The ansatz we suggest consists of original surface plus a
variational parameter $t$ multiplying the numerator $H_{0}$ of mean curvature
function defined over the surface. We point out that the integral of the square
of the mean curvature with respect to the surface parameter becomes a
polynomial in this variational parameter. Finding a zero, if there is any, of
this polynomial would end up at the same (minimal) surface as obtained by
minimizing more complicated area functional itself. We have instead minimized
this polynomial. Moreover, our minimization is restricted to a search in the
class of all surfaces allowed by our ansatz. All in all, we have not yet
obtained the exact minimal but we do reduce the area for the same fixed
boundary. This reduction is significant for a surface (hemiellipsoid) for which
we know the exact minimal surface. But for the bilinear interpolation spanned
by four bounding straight lines, which can model the initial and final
configurations of re-arranging strings, the decrease remains less than 0.8
percent of the original area. This may suggest that bilinear interpolation is
already a near minimal surface.
