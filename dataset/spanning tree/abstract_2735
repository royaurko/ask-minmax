We consider the biased random walk on a critical Galton-Watson tree
conditioned to survive, and confirm that this model with trapping belongs to
the same universality class as certain one-dimensional trapping models with
slowly-varying tails. Indeed, in each of these two settings, we establish
closely-related functional limit theorems involving an extremal process and
also demonstrate extremal aging occurs.
