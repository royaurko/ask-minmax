We consider a one-round two-player network pricing game, the Stackelberg
Minimum Spanning Tree game or StackMST.
  The game is played on a graph (representing a network), whose edges are
colored either red or blue, and where the red edges have a given fixed cost
(representing the competitor's prices). The first player chooses an assignment
of prices to the blue edges, and the second player then buys the cheapest
possible minimum spanning tree, using any combination of red and blue edges.
The goal of the first player is to maximize the total price of purchased blue
edges. This game is the minimum spanning tree analog of the well-studied
Stackelberg shortest-path game.
  We analyze the complexity and approximability of the first player's best
strategy in StackMST. In particular, we prove that the problem is APX-hard even
if there are only two different red costs, and give an approximation algorithm
whose approximation ratio is at most $\min \{k,1+\ln b,1+\ln W\}$, where $k$ is
the number of distinct red costs, $b$ is the number of blue edges, and $W$ is
the maximum ratio between red costs. We also give a natural integer linear
programming formulation of the problem, and show that the integrality gap of
the fractional relaxation asymptotically matches the approximation guarantee of
our algorithm.
