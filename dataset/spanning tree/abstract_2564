We study the number of connected spanning subgraphs $f_{d,b}(n)$ on the
generalized Sierpinski gasket $SG_{d,b}(n)$ at stage $n$ with dimension $d$
equal to two, three and four for $b=2$, and layer $b$ equal to three and four
for $d=2$. The upper and lower bounds for the asymptotic growth constant,
defined as $z_{SG_{d,b}}=\lim_{v \to \infty} \ln f_{d,b}(n)/v$ where $v$ is the
number of vertices, on $SG_{2,b}(n)$ with $b=2,3,4$ are derived in terms of the
results at a certain stage. The numerical values of $z_{SG_{d,b}}$ are
obtained.
