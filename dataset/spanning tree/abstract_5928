The Wiener index of a graph, which is the sum of the distances between all
pairs of vertices, has been well studied. Recently, Sills and Wang in 2012
proposed two conjectures on the maximal Wiener index of trees with a given
degree sequence. This note proves one of the two conjectures and disproves the
other.
