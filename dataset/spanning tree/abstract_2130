We study depth properties of a general class of random recursive trees where
each node i attaches to the random node iX_i and X_0, ..., X_n is a sequence of
i.i.d. random variables taking values in [0,1). We call such trees scaled
attachment random recursive trees (SARRT). We prove that the typical depth D_n,
the maximum depth (or height) H_n and the minimum depth M_n of a SARRT are
asymptotically given by D_n \sim \mu^{-1} \log n, H_n \sim \alpha_{\max} \log n
and M_n \sim \alpha_{\min} \log n where \mu, \alpha_{\max} and \alpha_{\min}
are constants depending only on the distribution of X_0 whenever X_0 has a
density. In particular, this gives a new elementary proof for the height of
uniform random recursive trees H_n \sim e \log n that does not use branching
random walks.
