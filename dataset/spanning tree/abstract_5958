In this work a combinatorial description is provided of a Faa di Bruno type
Hopf algebra which naturally appears in the context of Fliess operators in
nonlinear feedback control theory. It is a connected graded commutative and
non-cocommutative Hopf algebra defined on rooted circle trees. A cancellation
free forest formula for its antipode is given.
