Containment-based trees encompass various handy structures such as B+-trees,
R-trees and M-trees. They are widely used to build data indexes,
range-queryable overlays, publish/subscribe systems both in centralized and
distributed contexts. In addition to their versatility, their balanced shape
ensures an overall satisfactory performance. Re- cently, it has been shown that
their distributed implementations can be fault-resilient. However, this
robustness is achieved at the cost of un-balancing the structure. While the
structure remains correct in terms of searchability, its performance can be
significantly decreased. In this paper, we propose a distributed
self-stabilizing algorithm to balance containment-based trees.
