We consider the scattering amplitudes of five and six gravitons at tree-level
in superstring theory. Their power series expansions in the Regge slope alpha'
are analyzed through the order alpha'^8 showing some interesting constraints on
higher order gravitational couplings in the effective superstring action like
the absence of R^5 terms. Furthermore, some transcendentality constraints on
the coefficients of the non-vanishing couplings are observed: the absence of
zeta values of even weight through the order alpha'^8 like the absence of
zeta(2) zeta(3) R^6 terms. Our analysis is valid for any superstring background
in any space-time dimension, which allows for a conformal field theory
description.
