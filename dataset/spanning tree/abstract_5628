We study the nature of the frictional jamming transition within the framework
of rigidity percolation theory. Slowly sheared frictional packings are
decomposed into rigid clusters and floppy regions with a generalization of the
pebble game including frictional contacts. We discover a second-order
transition controlled by the emergence of a system-spanning rigid cluster
accompanied by a critical cluster size distribution. Rigid clusters also
correlate with common measures of rigidity. We contrast this result with
frictionless jamming, where the rigid cluster size distribution is noncritical.
