In this paper we examine the classes of graphs whose $K_n$-complements are
trees and quasi-threshold graphs and derive formulas for their number of
spanning trees; for a subgraph $H$ of $K_n$, the $K_n$-complement of $H$ is the
graph $K_n-H$ which is obtained from $K_n$ by removing the edges of $H$. Our
proofs are based on the complement spanning-tree matrix theorem, which
expresses the number of spanning trees of a graph as a function of the
determinant of a matrix that can be easily constructed from the adjacency
relation of the graph. Our results generalize previous results and extend the
family of graphs of the form $K_n-H$ admitting formulas for the number of their
spanning trees.
