We initiate a systematic study of amplitudes with massive external particles
on the Coulomb-branch of N=4 super Yang Mills theory: 1) We propose that
(multi-)soft-scalar limits of massless amplitudes at the origin of moduli space
can be used to determine Coulomb-branch amplitudes to leading order in the
mass. This is demonstrated in numerous examples. 2) We find compact explicit
expressions for several towers of tree-level amplitudes, including scattering
of two massive W-bosons with any number of positive helicity gluons, valid for
all values of the mass. 3) We present the general structure of superamplitudes
on the Coulomb branch. For example, the n-point "MHV-band" superamplitude is
proportional to a Grassmann polynomial of mixed degree 4 to 12, which is
uniquely determined by supersymmetry. We find explicit tree-level
superamplitudes for this MHV band and for other simple sectors of the theory.
4) Dual conformal generators are constructed, and we explore the dual conformal
properties of the simplest massive amplitudes. Our compact expressions for
amplitudes and superamplitudes should be of both theoretical and
phenomenological interest; in particular the tree-level results carry over to
truncations of the theory with less supersymmetry.
