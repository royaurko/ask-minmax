For a given graph consider a pair of disjoint matchings the union of which
contains as many edges as possible. Furthermore, consider the relation of the
cardinalities of a maximum matching and the largest matching in those pairs. It
is known that this relation does not exceed 5/4 for any graph. We characterize
the class of graphs for which this relation is precisely 5/4. Our
characterization implies that these graphs contain a spanning subgraph, every
component of which is the minimal graph of this class.
