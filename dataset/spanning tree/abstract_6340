In this paper we study the tightness of solutions for a family of recursion
equations. These equations arise naturally in the study of random walks on
tree-like structures. Examples include the maximal displacement of a branching
random walk in one dimension and the cover time of a symmetric simple random
walk on regular binary trees. Recursion equations associated with the
distribution functions of these quantities have been used to establish weak
laws of large numbers. Here, we use these recursion equations to establish the
tightness of the corresponding sequences of distribution functions after
appropriate centering. We phrase our results in a fairly general context, which
we hope will facilitate their application in other settings.
