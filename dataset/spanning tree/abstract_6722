Many applications log a large amount of events continuously. Extracting
interesting knowledge from logged events is an emerging active research area in
data mining. In this context, we propose an approach for mining frequent events
and association rules from logged events in XML format. This approach is
composed of two-main phases: I) constructing a novel tree structure called
Frequency XML-based Tree (FXT), which contains the frequency of events to be
mined; II) querying the constructed FXT using XQuery to discover frequent
itemsets and association rules. The FXT is constructed with a single-pass over
logged data. We implement the proposed algorithm and study various performance
issues. The performance study shows that the algorithm is efficient, for both
constructing the FXT and discovering association rules.
