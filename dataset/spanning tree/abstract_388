In the 1970's, Balas introduced the concept of disjunctive programming, which
is optimization over unions of polyhedra. One main result of his theory is
that, given linear descriptions for each of the polyhedra to be taken in the
union, one can easily derive an extended formulation of the convex hull of the
union of these polyhedra. In this paper, we give a generalization of this
result by extending the polyhedral structure of the variables coupling the
polyhedra taken in the union. Using this generalized concept, we derive
polynomial size linear programming formulations (compact formulations) for a
well-known spanning tree approximation of Steiner trees, for Gomory-Hu trees,
and, as a consequence, of the minimum $T$-cut problem (but not for the
associated $T$-cut polyhedron). Recently, Kaibel and Loos (2010) introduced a
more involved framework called {\em polyhedral branching systems} to derive
extended formulations. The most parts of our model can be expressed in terms of
their framework. The value of our model can be seen in the fact that it
completes their framework by an interesting algorithmic aspect.
