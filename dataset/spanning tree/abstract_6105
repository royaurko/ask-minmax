Let $Q_d$ denote the hypercube of dimension $d$. Given $d\geq m$, a spanning
subgraph $G$ of $Q_d$ is said to be $(Q_d,Q_m)$-saturated if it does not
contain $Q_m$ as a subgraph but adding any edge of $E(Q_d)\setminus E(G)$
creates a copy of $Q_m$ in $G$. Answering a question of Johnson and Pinto, we
show that for every fixed $m\geq2$ the minimum number of edges in a
$(Q_d,Q_m)$-saturated graph is $\Theta(2^d)$.
  We also study weak saturation, which is a form of bootstrap percolation. A
spanning subgraph of $Q_d$ is said to be weakly $(Q_d,Q_m)$-saturated if the
edges of $E(Q_d)\setminus E(G)$ can be added to $G$ one at a time so that each
added edge creates a new copy of $Q_m$. Answering another question of Johnson
and Pinto, we determine the minimum number of edges in a weakly
$(Q_d,Q_m)$-saturated graph for all $d\geq m\geq1$. More generally, we
determine the minimum number of edges in a subgraph of the $d$-dimensional grid
$P_k^d$ which is weakly saturated with respect to `axis aligned' copies of a
smaller grid $P_r^m$. We also study weak saturation of cycles in the grid.
