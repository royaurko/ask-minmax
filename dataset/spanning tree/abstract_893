In this paper, we consider an adaptive approach to address optimization
problems with uncertain cost parameters. Here, the decision maker selects an
initial decision, observes the realization of the uncertain cost parameters,
and then is permitted to modify the initial decision. We treat the uncertainty
using the framework of robust optimization in which uncertain parameters lie
within a given set. The decision maker optimizes so as to develop the best cost
guarantee in terms of the worst-case analysis. The recourse decision is
``incremental"; that is, the decision maker is permitted to change the initial
solution by a small fixed amount. We refer to the resulting problem as the
robust incremental problem. We study robust incremental variants of several
optimization problems. We show that the robust incremental counterpart of a
linear program is itself a linear program if the uncertainty set is polyhedral.
Hence, it is solvable in polynomial time. We establish the NP-hardness for
robust incremental linear programming for the case of a discrete uncertainty
set. We show that the robust incremental shortest path problem is NP-complete
when costs are chosen from a polyhedral uncertainty set, even in the case that
only one new arc may be added to the initial path. We also address the
complexity of several special cases of the robust incremental shortest path
problem and the robust incremental minimum spanning tree problem.
