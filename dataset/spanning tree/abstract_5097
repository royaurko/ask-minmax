We present results on the production of high transverse momentum pizero and
eta mesons in pp and pBe interactions at 530 and 800 GeV/c. The data span the
kinematic ranges: 1 < p_T < 10 GeV/c in transverse momentum and 1.5 units in
rapidity. The inclusive pizero cross sections are compared with next-to-leading
order QCD calculations and to expectations based on a phenomenological
parton-k_T model.
