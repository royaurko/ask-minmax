Some years ago it was shown by Ma that in the context of the electroweak
standard model there are, at the tree level, only three ways to generate small
neutrino masses by the see-saw mechanism via one effective dimension-five
operator. Here we extend this approach to 3-3-1 chiral models showing that in
this case there are several dimension-five operators and we also consider their
tree level realization.
