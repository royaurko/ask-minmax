We discuss renorming properties of the dual of a James tree space JT. We
present examples of weakly Lindelof determined JT such that JT* admits neither
strictly convex nor Kadec renorming and of weakly compactly generated JT such
that JT* does not admit Kadec renorming although it is strictly convexifiable.
