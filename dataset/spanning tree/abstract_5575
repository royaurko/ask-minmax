We demonstrate a fully coherent supercontinuum spectrum spanning 500 nm from
a silicon-on-insulator photonic wire waveguide pumped at 1575 nm wavelength. An
excellent agreement with numerical simulations is reported. The simulations
also show that a high level of two-photon absorption can essentially enforce
the coherence of the spectral broadening process irrespective of the pump pulse
duration.
