Discovering the latent structure from many observed variables is an important
yet challenging learning task. Existing approaches for discovering latent
structures often require the unknown number of hidden states as an input. In
this paper, we propose a quartet based approach which is \emph{agnostic} to
this number. The key contribution is a novel rank characterization of the
tensor associated with the marginal distribution of a quartet. This
characterization allows us to design a \emph{nuclear norm} based test for
resolving quartet relations. We then use the quartet test as a subroutine in a
divide-and-conquer algorithm for recovering the latent tree structure. Under
mild conditions, the algorithm is consistent and its error probability decays
exponentially with increasing sample size. We demonstrate that the proposed
approach compares favorably to alternatives. In a real world stock dataset, it
also discovers meaningful groupings of variables, and produces a model that
fits the data better.
