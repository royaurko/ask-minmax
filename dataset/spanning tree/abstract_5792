We fabricate gravitino vertex interactions using as only input on-shell
Yang-Mills amplitudes and the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye gauge theory / gravity
relations. A useful result of this analysis is simpler tree-level Feynman rules
for gravitino scattering than in traditional gauges. All results are explicitly
verified until five point scattering.
