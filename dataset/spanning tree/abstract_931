Graceful tree conjecture is a well-known open problem in graph theory. Here
we present a computational approach to this conjecture. An algorithm for
finding graceful labelling for trees is proposed. With this algorithm, we show
that every tree with at most 35 vertices allows a graceful labelling, hence we
verify that the graceful tree conjecture is correct for trees with at most 35
vertices.
