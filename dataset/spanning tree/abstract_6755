In this paper we consider a null recurrent random walk in random environment
on a super-critical Galton-Watson tree. We consider the case where the
log-Laplace transform $\psi$ of the branching process satisfies
$\psi(1)=\psi'(1)=0$ for which G. Faraud, Y. Hu and Z. Shi in \cite{HuShi10b}
show that, with probability one, the largest generation visited by the walk,
until the instant $n$, is of the order of $(\log n)^3$. In
\cite{AndreolettiDebs1} we prove that the largest generation entirely visited
behaves almost surely like $\log n$ up to a constant. Here we study how the
walk visits the generations $\ell=(\log n)^{1+ \zeta}$, with $0 < \zeta <2$. We
obtain results in probability giving the asymptotic logarithmic behavior of the
number of visited sites at a given generation. We prove that there is a phase
transition at generation $(\log n)^2$ for the mean of visited sites until $n$
returns to the root. Also we show that the visited sites spread all over the
tree until generation $\ell$.
