We extend a previous improved action study of the Landau gauge gluon
propagator, by using a variety of lattices with spacings from $a = 0.17$ to
0.41 fm, to more fully explore finite volume and discretization effects. We
also extend a previously used technique for minimizing lattice artifacts, the
appropriate choice of momentum variable or ``kinematic correction'', by
considering it more generally as a ``tree-level correction''. We demonstrate
that by using tree-level correction, determined by the tree-level behavior of
the action being considered, it is possible to obtain scaling behavior over a
very wide range of momenta and lattice spacings. This makes it possible to
explore the infinite volume and continuum limits of the Landau-gauge gluon
propagator.
