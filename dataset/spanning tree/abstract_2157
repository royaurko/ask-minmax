In the past several years a wide range of methods for the construction of
regression trees and other estimators based on the recursive partitioning of
samples have appeared in the statistics literature. Many applications involve
data collected through a complex sample design. At present, however, relatively
little is known regarding the properties of these methods under complex
designs. This article proposes a method for incorporating information about the
complex sample design when building a regression tree using a recursive
partitioning algorithm. Sufficient conditions are established for asymptotic
design L 2 consistency of these regression trees as estimators for an arbitrary
regression function. The proposed method is illustrated with Occupational
Employment Statistics establishment survey data linked to Quarterly Census of
Employment and Wage payroll data of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Performance
of the nonparametric estimator is investigated through a simulation study based
on this example.
