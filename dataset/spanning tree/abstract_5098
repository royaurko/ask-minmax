We present results on the production of high transverse momentum pizero and
eta mesons in pi-p and pi-Be interactions at 515 GeV/c. The data span the
kinematic ranges 1 < p_T < 11 GeV/c in transverse momentum and -0.75 < y < 0.75
in rapidity. The inclusive pizero cross sections are compared with
next-to-leading order QCD calculations and to expectations based on a
phenomenological parton-k_T model.
