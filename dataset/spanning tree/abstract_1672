The self-trapping transition due to a single and a dimer nonlinear impurity
embedded in a Cayley tree is studied. In particular, the effect of a perfectly
nonlinear Cayley tree is considered. A sharp self-trapping transition is
observed in each case. It is also observed that the transition is much sharper
compared to the case of one-dimensional lattices. For each system, the critical
values of $\chi$ for the self-trapping transitions are found to obey a
power-law behavior as a function of the connectivity $K$ of the Cayley tree.
