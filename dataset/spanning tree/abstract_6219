In the MSSM, we make a careful tree-level study of Charge and Color Breaking
conditions in the plane $(H_2, \tilde{u}_L, \tilde{u}_R)$, focusing on the top
quark scalar case. A simple and fast procedure to compute the VEVs of the
dangerous vacuum is presented and used to derive a model-independent optimal
CCB bound on $A_t$. This bound takes into account all possible deviations of
the CCB vacuum from the D-flat directions. For large $\tan \beta$, it provides
a CCB maximal mixing for the stop scalar fields $\tilde{t}_1,\tilde{t}_2$,
which automatically rules out the Higgs maximal mixing $|A_t|=\sqrt{6}
m_{\tilde{t}}$. As a result, strong limits on the stop mass spectrum and a
reduction, in some cases substantial, of the one-loop upper bound on the
CP-even lightest Higgs boson mass, $m_h$, are obtained. To incorporate one-loop
leading corrections, this tree-level CCB condition should be evaluated at an
appropriate renormalization scale which proves to be the SUSY scale.
