In the framework of an SU(3) (axial)vector meson extended linear sigma model
with additional constituent quarks and Polyakov loops, we investigate the
effects of (axial)vector mesons on the chiral phase transition. The parameters
of the Lagrangian are set at zero temperature and we use a hybrid approach
where in the effective potential the constituent quarks are treated at one-loop
level and all the mesons at tree-level. We have four order parameters, two
scalar condensates and two Polyakov loop variables and their temperature and
baryochemical potential dependence are determined from the corresponding field
equations. We also investigate the changes of the tree-level scalar meson
masses in the hot and dense medium.
