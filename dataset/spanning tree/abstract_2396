A new method of verifying the subnormality of unbounded Hilbert space
operators based on an approximation technique is proposed. Diverse sufficient
conditions for subnormality of unbounded weighted shifts on directed trees are
established. An approach to this issue via consistent systems of probability
measures is invented. The role played by determinate Stieltjes moment sequences
is elucidated. Lambert's characterization of subnormality of bounded operators
is shown to be valid for unbounded weighted shifts on directed trees that have
sufficiently many quasi-analytic vectors, which is a new phenomenon in this
area.
