A locally connected spanning tree of a graph $G$ is a spanning tree $T$ of
$G$ such that the set of all neighbors of $v$ in $T$ induces a connected
subgraph of $G$ for every $v\in V(G)$. The purpose of this paper is to give
linear-time algorithms for finding locally connected spanning trees on strongly
chordal graphs and proper circular-arc graphs, respectively.
