We define and give explicit construction of the universal tree-graded space
with a given collection of pieces. We apply that to proving uniqueness of
asymptotic cones of relatively hyperbolic groups whose peripheral subgroups
have unique asymptotic cones. Modulo the Continuum Hypothesis, we show that if
an asymptotic cone of a geodesic metric space is homogeneous and has cut
points, then it is the universal tree-graded space with pieces - maximal
connected subsets without their own cut points. Thus it is completely
determined by its collection of pieces.
