The scaling behavior of the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect was studied by
deforming Al-2.5%Mg alloy for a wide range of strain rates. To reveal the exact
scaling nature, the time series data of true stress vs. time, obtained during
deformation, were analyzed by two complementary methods: the finite variance
scaling method and the diffusion entropy analysis. From these analyses we could
establish that in the entire span of strain rates, PLC effect showed Levy walk
property.
