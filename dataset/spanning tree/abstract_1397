By weighted tree we understand such connected tree,that: a) each its vertex
and each edge have a positive integer weight; b) the weight of each vertex is
equal to the sum of weights of outgoing edges. Each tree has a binary structure
--- we can color its vertices in two colors, black and white so, that adjacent
vertices have different colors. A type is a set of pairwise non-isotopic plane
weighted trees with a given list of weights of white vertices and a given list
of weights of black vertices. In this work we present a method for computing
the cardinality of a given type.
