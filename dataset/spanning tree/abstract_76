This paper addresses the basic question of how well can a tree approximate
distances of a metric space or a graph. Given a graph, the problem of
constructing a spanning tree in a graph which strongly preserves distances in
the graph is a fundamental problem in network design. We present scaling
distortion embeddings where the distortion scales as a function of $\epsilon$,
with the guarantee that for each $\epsilon$ the distortion of a fraction
$1-\epsilon$ of all pairs is bounded accordingly. Such a bound implies, in
particular, that the \emph{average distortion} and $\ell_q$-distortions are
small. Specifically, our embeddings have \emph{constant} average distortion and
$O(\sqrt{\log n})$ $\ell_2$-distortion. This follows from the following
results: we prove that any metric space embeds into an ultrametric with scaling
distortion $O(\sqrt{1/\epsilon})$. For the graph setting we prove that any
weighted graph contains a spanning tree with scaling distortion
$O(\sqrt{1/\epsilon})$. These bounds are tight even for embedding in arbitrary
trees.
 For probabilistic embedding into spanning trees we prove a scaling distortion
of $\tilde{O}(\log^2 (1/\epsilon))$, which implies \emph{constant}
$\ell_q$-distortion for every fixed $q<\infty$.
