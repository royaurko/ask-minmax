Dynamical properties of a long polymer ring in a melt of unknotted and
unconcatenated rings are calculated. We re-examine and generalize the well
known model of a ring confined to a lattice of topological obstacles in the
light of the recently developed Flory theory of unentangled rings which maps
every ring on an annealed branched polymer and establishes that the backbone
associated with each ring follows self-avoiding rather than Gaussian random
walk statistics. We find the scaling of ring relaxation time and diffusion
coefficient with ring length, as well as time dependence of stress relaxation
modulus, zero shear viscosity and mean square averaged displacements of both
individual monomers and ring's mass center. Our results agree within error bars
with all available experimental and simulations data of the ring melt, although
the quality of the data so far is insufficient to make a definitive judgment
for or against the annealed tree theory. In the end we review briefly the
relation between our findings and experimental data on chromatin dynamics.
