In population and evolutionary biology, hypotheses about micro-evolutionary
and macro-evolutionary processes are commonly tested by comparing the shape
indices of empirical evolutionary trees with those predicted by neutral models.
A key ingredient in this approach is the ability to compute and quantify
distributions of various tree shape indices under random models of interest. As
a step to meet this challenge, in this paper we investigate the joint
distribution of cherries and pitchforks (that is, subtrees with two and three
leaves) under two widely used null models: the Yule-Harding-Kingman (YHK) model
and the proportional to distinguishable arrangements (PDA) model. Based on two
novel recursive formulae, we propose a dynamic approach to numerically compute
the exact joint distribution (and hence the marginal distributions) for trees
of any size. We also obtained insights into the statistical properties of trees
generated under these two models, including a constant correlation between the
cherry and the pitchfork distributions under the YHK model, the log-concavity
and unimodality of cherry distributions under both models. In particular, we
show the existence of a unique change point for cherry distribution between the
two models, that is, there exists a critical value $\tau_n$ for each $n\geq 4$
such that the probability that a random tree with $n$ leaves generated under
the YHK model contains $k$ cherries is lower than that under the PDA model if
$1<k< \tau_n$, and higher if $\tau_n<k\le n/2$.
