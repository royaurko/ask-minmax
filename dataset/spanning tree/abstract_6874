We consider the contact process with infection rate $\lambda$ on a random
$(d+1)$-regular graph with $n$ vertices, $G_n$. We study the extinction time
$\tau_{G_n}$ (that is, the random amount of time until the infection
disappears) as $n$ is taken to infinity. We establish a phase transition
depending on whether $\lambda$ is smaller or larger than
$\lambda_1(\mathbb{T}^d)$, the lower critical value for the contact process on
the infinite, $(d+1)$-regular tree: if $\lambda < \lambda_1(\mathbb{T}^d)$,
$\tau_{G_n}$ grows logarithmically with $n$, while if $\lambda >
\lambda_1(\mathbb{T}^d)$, it grows exponentially with $n$. This result differs
from the situation where, instead of $G_n$, the contact process is considered
on the $d$-ary tree of finite height, since in this case, the transition is
known to happen instead at the _upper_ critical value for the contact process
on $\mathbb{T}^d$.
