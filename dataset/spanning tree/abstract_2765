A natural partial order on the set of prime numbers was derived by the contributor
from the internal symmetries of the primary finite fields, independently of
Ford a.a., who investigated Pratt trees for primality tests.
  It leads to a correspondence with the Hopf algebra of rooted trees, and as an
application, to an alternative approach to the Prime Number Theorem.
