We generalize Dirichlet's $S$-unit theorem from the usual group of $S$-units
of a number field $K$ to the infinite rank group of all algebraic numbers
having nontrivial valuations only on places lying over $S$. Specifically, we
demonstrate that the group of algebraic $S$-units modulo torsion is a
$\bQ$-vector space which, when normed by the Weil height, spans a hyperplane
determined by the product formula, and that the elements of this vector space
which are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$ retain their linear
independence over $\mathbb{R}$.
