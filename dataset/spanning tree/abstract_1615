We show that the genealogy of any self-similar fragmentation process can be
encoded in a compact measured real tree. Under some Malthusian hypotheses, we
compute the fractal Hausdorff dimension of this tree through the use of a
natural measure on the set of its leaves. This generalizes previous work of
Haas and Miermont which was restricted to conservative fragmentation processes.
