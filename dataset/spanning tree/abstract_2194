Ge, Rusjan, and Zweifel (J. Stat. Phys. 59, 1265 (1990)) introduced a binary
tree which represents all the periodic windows in the chaotic regime of
iterated one-dimensional unimodal maps. We consider the scaling behavior in a
modified tree which takes into account the self-similarity of the window
structure. A non-universal geometric convergence of the associated superstable
parameter values towards a Misiurewicz point is observed for almost all binary
sequences with periodic tails. There are an infinite number of exceptional
sequences, however, which lead to superexponential scaling. The origin of such
sequences is explained.
