We prove the existence of a limit of the finite volume probability measures
generated by tree growth rules in Ford's alpha model of phylogenetic trees. The
limiting measure is shown to be concentrated on the set of trees consisting of
exactly one infinite spine with finite, identically and independently
distributed outgrowths.
