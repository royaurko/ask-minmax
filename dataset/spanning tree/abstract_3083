In order to gain an understanding of the effectiveness of phylogenetic Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), it is important to understand how quickly the
empirical distribution of the MCMC converges to the posterior distribution. In
this paper we investigate this problem on phylogenetic tree topologies with a
metric that is especially well suited to the task: the subtree
prune-and-regraft (SPR) metric. This metric directly corresponds to the minimum
number of MCMC rearrangements required to move between trees in common
phylogenetic MCMC implementations. We develop a novel graph-based approach to
analyze tree posteriors and find that the SPR metric is much more informative
than simpler metrics that are unrelated to MCMC moves. In doing so we show
conclusively that topological peaks do occur in Bayesian phylogenetic
posteriors from real data sets as sampled with standard MCMC approaches,
investigate the efficiency of Metropolis-coupled MCMC (MCMCMC) in traversing
the valleys between peaks, and show that conditional clade distribution (CCD)
can have systematic problems when there are multiple peaks.
