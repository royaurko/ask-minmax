Tree amplitudes for baryon-pion scattering are studied in the 1/N_c
expansion. Generalized large-N_c consistency conditions are obtained to all
orders in baryon mass splittings. For baryons with spin J ~ O(1), the leading
order in N_c tree amplitudes can be evaluated keeping only terms up to a given
finite order in baryon mass splittings.
