In the two-quark model supposition for $K_0^{*}(1430)$, the branching ratios
and the direct CP-violating asymmetries for decays $\bar B_s^0\to
K^{*0}_0(1430)\pi^0, K^{*+}_0(1430)\pi^-$ are studied by employing the
perturbative QCD factorization approach. We find that although these two decays
are both tree-dominated, the ratio of their penguin to tree contributions are
very different: there is only a few percent for the decay $\bar B_s^0\to
K^{*+}_0(1430)\pi^-$, while about 37% in scenario I, even 51% in scenario II
for the decay $\bar B_s^0\to K^{*0}_0(1430)\pi^0$. It results that these two
decays have very different values in the branching ratios and the direct CP
asymmetries. The branching ratio of the decay $\bar B_s^0\to
K^{*+}_0(1430)\pi^-$ is at the order of $10^{-5}$, and its direct CP asymmetry
is about (20-30)%. While for the decay $\bar B_s^0\to K^{*0}_0(1430)\pi^0$, its
direct CP-violating asymmetry is very large and about 90%, but it is difficult
to measure it, because the branching ratio for this channel is small and only
$10^{-7}$ order.
