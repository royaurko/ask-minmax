Answering some questions of Gutman, we show that, except for four specific
trees, every connected graph G of order n, with no cycle of order 4 and with
maximum degree at most 3, has energy greater that its order. Here, the energy
of a graph is the sum of the moduli of its eigenvalues. We give more general
theorems and state two conjectures.
