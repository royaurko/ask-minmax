The signless Laplacian matrix of a graph $G$ is defined to be the sum of its
adjacency matrix and degree diagonal matrix, and its eigenvalues are called
$Q$-eigenvalues of $G$. A $Q$-eigenvalue of a graph $G$ is called a $Q$-main
eigenvalue if it has an eigenvector the sum of whose entries is not equal to
zero. Chen and Huang [L. Chen, Q.X. Huang, Trees, unicyclic graphs and bicyclic
graphs with exactly two $Q$-main eigenvalues, submitted for publication]
characterized all trees, unicylic graphs and bicyclic graphs with exactly two
main $Q$-eigenvalues, respectively. As a continuance of it, in this paper, all
tricyclic graphs with exactly two $Q$-main eigenvalues are characterized.
