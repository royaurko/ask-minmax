We give a description of the boundary of a complex of free factors that is
analogous to E. Klarreich's description of the boundary of a curve complex. The
argument uses the geometry of folding paths developed by Bestvina and Feighn as
well as structural results about very small trees developed by Coulbois,
Hilion, Lustig, and Reynolds.
