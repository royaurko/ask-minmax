Using the newly modified method developed for symbolic evaluation of Feynman
amplitudes we examine two processes $2\to 2$ (including a case of Majorana
fermions) at a tree level. Constructing special polarization basis for spinor
particles, we obtain compact expressions for helicity amplitudes. We present
the regular way for simplification of evaluated symbolic expressions.
