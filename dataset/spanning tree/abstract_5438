We explore a novel method of mass reconstruction in events with missing
transverse momentum at hadron colliders. In events with sizeable boost factors
in the final steps of dual multi-stage decay chains, the missing energy
particles may each be approximately collinear with a visible standard model
particle, spanning a narrow "MET-cone." We exploit this collinear
approximation, when applicable, to reconstruct the masses of exotica.
