We examine the ground state and excitations of the one dimensional extended
Hubbard model with long range interaction. The ground state wavefunctions and
low lying excitations are given explicitly in the form of a Jastrow product of
two body terms. This results motivates an asymptotic Bethe-ansatz for the
model. We present evidence that this solution is in fact exact and spans the
complete spectrum of states.
