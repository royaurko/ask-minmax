This talk is a report on joint work with A. Vaintrob [arXiv:math.CO/0109104
and math.GT/0111102]. It is organised as follows. We begin by recalling how the
classical Matrix-Tree Theorem relates two different expressions for the lowest
degree coefficient of the Alexander-Conway polynomial of a link. We then state
our formula for the lowest degree coefficient of an algebraically split link in
terms of Milnor's triple linking numbers. We explain how this formula can be
deduced from a determinantal expression due to Traldi and Levine by means of
our Pfaffian Matrix-Tree Theorem [arXiv:math.CO/0109104]. We also discuss the
approach via finite type invariants, which allowed us in
[arXiv:math.GT/0111102] to obtain the same result directly from some properties
of the Alexander-Conway weight system. This approach also gives similar results
if all Milnor numbers up to a given order vanish.
