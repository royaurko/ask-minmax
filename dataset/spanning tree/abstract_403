Floor-planning is a fundamental step in VLSI chip design. Based upon the
concept of orderly spanning trees, we present a simple O(n)-time algorithm to
construct a floor-plan for any n-node plane triangulation. In comparison with
previous floor-planning algorithms in the literature, our solution is not only
simpler in the algorithm itself, but also produces floor-plans which require
fewer module types. An equally important aspect of our new algorithm lies in
its ability to fit the floor-plan area in a rectangle of size (n-1)x(2n+1)/3.
Lower bounds on the worst-case area for floor-planning any plane triangulation
are also provided in the paper.
