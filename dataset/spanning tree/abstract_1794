By studying an admissible family of branching mechanisms introduced in Li
(2014), we obtain a pruning procedure on L\'evy trees. Then we could construct
a decreasing L\'evy-CRT-valued process $\{\T_t\}$ by pruning L\'evy trees and
an analogous process $\{\T^*_t\}$ by pruning a critical L\'evy tree conditioned
to be infinite. Under a regular condition on the admissible family of branching
mechanisms, we show that the law of $\{\T_t\}$ at the ascension time can be
represented by $\{\T^*_t\}$. The results generalize those studied in Abraham
and Delmas (2012).
