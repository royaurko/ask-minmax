The problem of finding the ground state of a frustration-free Hamiltonian
carrying only two-body interactions between qubits is known to be solvable in
polynomial time. It is also shown recently that, for any such Hamiltonian,
there is always a ground state that is a product of single- or two-qubit
states. However, it remains unclear whether the whole ground space is of any
succinct structure. Here, we give a complete characterization of the ground
space of any two-body frustration-free Hamiltonian of qubits. Namely, it is a
span of tree tensor network states of the same tree structure. This
characterization allows us to show that the problem of determining the ground
state degeneracy is as hard as, but no harder than, its classical analog.
