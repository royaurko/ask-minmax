We study the Abelian sandpile model on Z^d. In dimensions at least 3 we prove
existence of the infinite volume addition operator, almost surely with respect
to the infinite volume limit mu of the uniform measures on recurrent
configurations. We prove the existence of a Markov process with stationary
measure mu, and study ergodic properties of this process. The main techniques
we use are a connection between the statistics of waves and uniform
two-component spanning trees and results on the uniform spanning tree measure
on Z^d.
