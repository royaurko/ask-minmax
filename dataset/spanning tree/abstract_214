We present a detailed asymptotic analysis of correlation functions for the
two component spanning tree on the two-dimensional lattice when one component
contains three paths connecting vicinities of two fixed lattice sites at large
distance $s$ apart. We extend the known result for correlations on the plane to
the case of the upper half-plane with closed and open boundary conditions. We
found asymptotics of correlations for distance $r$ from the boundary to one of
the fixed lattice sites for the cases $r\gg s \gg 1$ and $s \gg r \gg 1$.
