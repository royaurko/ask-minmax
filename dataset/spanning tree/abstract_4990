We have analyzed five ROSAT HRI images of the Crab Nebula spanning the years
1991 to 1997 and have found significant changes in the emission structure of
the X-ray torus surrounding the pulsar. Certain regions increase in brightness
by about 20% over the six years, while others show decreases in surface
brightness. The origin of these changes is unclear, but a possible explanation
is that the bulk velocity of the synchrotron radiating electrons has decreased
on the order of 20% as well.
