It is shown that if there is a measurable cardinal above n Woodin cardinals
and M_{n+1}^# doesn't exist then K exists. K is not fully iterable, though, but
only iterable with respect to stacks of certain trees living between the Woodin
cardinals. However, it is still true that if M is an omega-closed iterate of V
then K^M is an iterate of K.
