We consider random energy landscapes constructed from d-dimensional lattices
or trees. The distribution of the number of local minima in such landscapes
follows a large deviation principle and we derive the associated law exactly
for dimension 1. Also of interest is the probability of the maximum possible
number of minima; this probability scales exponentially with the number of
sites. We calculate analytically the corresponding exponent for the Cayley tree
and the two-leg ladder; for 2 to 5 dimensional hypercubic lattices, we compute
the exponent numerically and compare to the Cayley tree case.
