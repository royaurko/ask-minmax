Fix g>1. Every graph of large enough tree-width contains a g x g grid as a
minor; but here we prove that every four-edge-connected graph of large enough
tree-width contains a g x g grid as an immersion (and hence contains any fixed
graph with maximum degree at most four as an immersion). This result has a
number of applications.
