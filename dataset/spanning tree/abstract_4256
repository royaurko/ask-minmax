We prove existence of the scaling limit of the invasion percolation cluster
(IPC) on a regular tree. The limit is a random real tree with a single end. The
contour and height functions of the limit are described as certain diffusive
stochastic processes. This convergence allows us to recover and make precise
certain asymptotic results for the IPC. In particular, we relate the limit of
the rescaled level sets of the IPC to the local time of the scaled height
function.
