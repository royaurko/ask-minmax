We prove that for a relatively hyperbolic group G there is a sequence of
relatively hyperbolic proper quotients such that their growth rates converge to
the growth rate of G. Under natural assumptions, the same conclusion holds for
the critical exponent of a cusp-uniform action of G on a hyperbolic metric
space. As a corollary, we obtain that the critical exponent of a torsion-free
geometrically finite Kleinian group can be arbitrarily approximated by those of
quotient groups. This resolves a question of Dal'bo-Peign\'e-Picaud-Sambusetti.
  Our approach is based on the study of Patterson-Sullivan measures on Bowditch
boundary of a relatively hyperbolic group. The uniqueness and ergodicity of
Patterson-Sullivan measures are proved when the group is divergent. We prove a
variant of the Sullivan Shadow Lemma, called Partial Shadow Lemma. This tool
allows us to prove several results on growth functions of balls and cones. One
central result is the existence of a sequence of geodesic trees with growth
rates sufficiently close to the growth rate of G, and transition points
uniformly spaced in trees. By taking small cancellation over hyperbolic
elements of high powers, we can embed these trees into properly constructed
quotients of G. This proves the results in the previous paragraph.
