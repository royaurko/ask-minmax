Ground-based photometric observations from WASP have been calibrated, scaled
and combined with Kepler observations of the $\delta$ Sct star KIC 7106205,
allowing us to extend the time base of the study of the unexplained amplitude
and frequency variation of a single pressure mode at $\nu=13.3942$ d$^{-1}$ by
2 yr. Analysis of the combined data sets, spanning 6 yr, show that the
amplitude modulation in KIC 7106205 has a much larger range than a previous
study of the Kepler data alone indicated. The single pressure mode decreased
from $11.70 \pm 0.05$ mmag in 2007, to $5.87 \pm 0.03$ mmag in 2009, and to
$0.58 \pm 0.06$ mmag in 2013. Observations of the decrease in mode amplitude
have now been extended back 2 yr before the launch of Kepler. With observations
over a longer time span, we have been able to further investigate the decrease
in mode amplitude in KIC 7106205 to address the question of mode amplitude
stability in $\delta$ Sct stars. This study highlights the usefulness of the
WASP data set for extending studies of some Kepler variable stars.
