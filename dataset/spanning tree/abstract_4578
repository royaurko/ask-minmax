We consider the generating polynomial of the number of rooted trees on the
set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ counted by the number of descending edges (a parent with
a greater label than a child). This polynomial is an extension of the descent
generating polynomial of the set of permutations of a totally ordered $n$-set,
known as the Eulerian polynomial. We show how this extension shares some of the
properties of the classical one. B. Drake proved that this polynomial factors
completely over the integers. From his product formula it can be concluded that
this polynomial has positive coefficients in the $\gamma$-basis and we show
that a formula for these coefficients can also be derived. We discuss various
combinatorial interpretations of these positive coefficients in terms of
leaf-labeled binary trees and in terms of the Stirling permutations introduced
by Gessel and Stanley. These interpretations are derived from previous results
of the contributor and Wachs related to the poset of weighted partitions and the
free multibracketed Lie algebra.
