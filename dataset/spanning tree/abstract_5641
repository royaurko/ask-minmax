Using an anisotropic hybridization matrix element, V($\vec k$), reflecting
cubic symmetry at the ``rare-earth'' sites of the infinite U Anderson lattice,
we calculate the bare quasiparticle scattering amplitude to order 1/N using
slave Bosons and find significant differences with previous results under
spherical symmetry. Due to exchange of density fluctuations, we find an
instability. toward E$_g$ and T$_{1g}$ (even-parity) pairing.
