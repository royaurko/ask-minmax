We give the first data structure for the problem of maintaining a dynamic set
of n elements drawn from a partially ordered universe described by a tree. We
define the Line-Leaf Tree, a linear-sized data structure that supports the
operations: insert; delete; test membership; and predecessor. The performance
of our data structure is within an O(log w)-factor of optimal. Here w <= n is
the width of the partial-order---a natural obstacle in searching a partial
order.
