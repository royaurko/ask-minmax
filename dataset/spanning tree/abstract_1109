We study tree metrics that can be realized as a mixture of two star tree
metrics. We prove that the only trees admitting such a decomposition are the
ones coming from a tree with at most one internal edge, and whose weight
satisfies certain linear inequalities. We also characterize the fibers of the
corresponding mixture map. In addition, we discuss the general framework of
tropical secant varieties and we interpret our results within this setting.
Finally, we show that the set of tree metric ranks of metrics on $n$ taxa is
unbounded.
