It has been hypothesized that the rather small number of crossings in real
syntactic dependency trees is a side-effect of pressure for dependency length
minimization. Here we answer a related important research question: what would
be the expected number of crossings if the natural order of a sentence was
lost? We show that this number depends only on the number of vertices of the
dependency tree (the sentence length) and the second moment of vertex degrees.
The expected number of crossings is minimum for a star tree (crossings are
impossible) and maximum for a linear tree (the number of crossings is of the
order of the square of the sequence length).
