Given an undirected planar graph G with n vertices and a set S of n points
inside a simple polygon P, a point-set embedding of G on S is a planar drawing
of G such that each vertex is mapped to a distinct point of S and the edges are
polygonal chains surrounded by P. A special case of the embedding problem is
that in which G is a balanced binary tree. In this paper, we present a new
algorithm for embedding an n-vertex balanced binary tree BBT on a set S of n
points bounded by a simple m-gon P in O(m^2 + n(log n)^2 + mn) time with at
most O(m) bends per edge.
