Let $T$ be a distinguished subset of vertices in a graph $G$. A
$T$-\emph{Steiner tree} is a subgraph of $G$ that is a tree and that spans $T$.
Kriesell conjectured that $G$ contains $k$ pairwise edge-disjoint $T$-Steiner
trees provided that every edge-cut of $G$ that separates $T$ has size $\ge 2k$.
When $T=V(G)$ a $T$-Steiner tree is a spanning tree and the conjecture is a
consequence of a classic theorem due to Nash-Williams and Tutte. Lau proved
that Kriesell's conjecture holds when $2k$ is replaced by $24k$, and recently
West and Wu have lowered this value to $6.5k$. Our main result makes a further
improvement to $5k+4$.
