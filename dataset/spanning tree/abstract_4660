We report nine new transit epochs of the extrasolar planet, observed in the
Bessell-I band with SOAR at the Cerro Pachon Observatory and with the SMARTS
1-m Telescope at CTIO, between August 2008 and October 2009. The new transits
have been combined with all previously published transit data for this planet
to provide a new Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) analysis of its orbit. We
find no evidence of TTVs RMS variations larger than 1 min over a 3 year time
span. This result discards the presence of planets more massive than about 5
M_earth, 1 M_earth and 2 M_earth around the 1:2, 5:3 and 2:1 orbital
resonances. These new detection limits exceed by ~5-30 times the limits imposed
by current radial velocity observations in the Mean Motion Resonances of this
system. Our search for the variation of other parameters, such as orbital
inclination and transit depth also yields negative results over the total time
span of the transit observations. This result supports formation theories that
predict a paucity of planetary companions to Hot Jupiters.
