We discuss the phases of QCD in the parameter space spanned by the number of
light flavours and the temperature with respect to the realisation of chiral
and conformal symmetries. The intriguing interplay of these symmetries is best
studied by means of lattice simulations, and some selected results from our
recent work are presented here.
