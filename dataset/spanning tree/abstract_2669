J. Herzog, T. Hibi, N. V. Trung and X. Zheng characterize the vertex cover
algebras which are standard graded. In this paper we give a simple
combinatorial criterion for the standard graded property of vertex cover
algebras in the case of quasi-trees. We also give an example of how this
criterion works and compute the maximal degree of a minimal generator in that
case.
