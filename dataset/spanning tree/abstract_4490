Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field.
The problem of constructing indecomposable $A$-modules inductively from simple
ones by means of exact sequences - called accessibility - is the starting point
of the present diploma-thesis. It has lead us to the consideration of
exceptional and indecomposable tree-representations of finite quivers.
Following Ringel, we prove his result that exceptional representations are
tree-representations. We give a detailed description of the various aspects of
the Schofield-Induction which plays an important role in the proof. Moreover we
introduce a functor (strong hypotheses being given) which enables us to
construct indecomposable modules of an algebra from indecomposable
representations of a certain bipartite quiver. We also give a proof of Ringel's
result that each exceptional representation of dimension $d>1$ of a generalized
Kronecker quiver has an indecomposable factor- or subrepresentation of
dimension $d-1$. The thesis is concluded by some calculations showing the
accessibility of representations of the 3-Kronecker-quiver in small dimensions.
