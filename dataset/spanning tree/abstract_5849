We characterize the Carleson measures for the Drury-Arveson Hardy space and
other Hilbert spaces of analytic functions of several complex variables. This
provides sharp estimates for Drury's generalization of Von Neumann's
inequality. The characterization is in terms of a geometric condition, the
"split tree condition", which reflects the nonisotropic geometry underlying the
Drury-Arveson Hardy space.
