We present the results of a study aimed at assessing whether low and high
mass stars form similarly. Our approach is (1) to examine the observed
projected rotational velocities among a large sample of newly-formed stars
spanning a range in mass between 0.2 and 50 M ; and (2) to search for evidence
of a discontinuity in rotational properties that might indicate a difference in
the stellar formation process at some characteristic mass. Our database
includes both recently published values of v sin i for young intermediate- and
low- mass stars in Orion, as well as new observations of O stars located in
young clusters and OB associations. We find that the median of the quantity
v_obs/v_c (observed rotational speed/equatorial breakup velocity) is typically
about 0.15 and shows no evidence of a discontinuity over the full range of
stellar masses, while the quantity Jsini/M (derived angular momentum per unit
mass) exhibits a slow, monotonic rise with increasing mass with no evidence of
a discontinuity. We suggest that these observations are most simply interpreted
as indicative of a single stellar formation and angular momentum regulation
mechanism: one that results in rotation rates well below breakup, and angular
momenta per unit mass that differ systematically by no more than a factor of
3-4 over a mass range spanning a factor of 250.
