Zeros of the $n$th moment of the partition function $[Z^n]$ are investigated
in a vanishing temperature limit $\beta \to \infty$, $n \to 0$ keeping $y=\beta
n \sim O(1)$. In this limit, the moment parameterized by $y$ characterizes the
distribution of the ground-state energy. We numerically investigate the zeros
for $\pm J$ Ising spin glass models with several ladder and tree systems, which
can be carried out with a feasible computational cost by a symbolic operation
based on the Bethe--Peierls method. For several tree systems we find that the
zeros tend to approach the real axis of $y$ in the thermodynamic limit implying
that the moment cannot be described by a single analytic function of $y$ as the
system size tends to infinity, which may be associated with breaking of the
replica symmetry. However, examination of the analytical properties of the
moment function and assessment of the spin-glass susceptibility indicate that
the breaking of analyticity is relevant to neither one-step or full replica
symmetry breaking.
