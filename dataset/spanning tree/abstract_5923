A scaling limit for the simple random walk on the largest connected component
of the Erdos-Renyi random graph in the critical window is deduced. The limiting
diffusion is constructed using resistance form techniques, and is shown to
satisfy the same quenched short-time heat kernel asymptotics as the Brownian
motion on the continuum random tree.
