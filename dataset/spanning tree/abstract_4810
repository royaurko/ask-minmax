We prove for the contact process on $Z^d$, and many other graphs, that the
upper invariant measure dominates a homogeneous product measure with large
density if the infection rate $\lambda$ is sufficiently large. As a
consequence, this measure percolates if the corresponding product measure
percolates. We raise the question of whether domination holds in the symmetric
case for all infinite graphs of bounded degree. We study some asymmetric
examples which we feel shed some light on this question. We next obtain
necessary and sufficient conditions for domination of a product measure for
``downward'' FKG measures. As a consequence of this general result, we show
that the plus and minus states for the Ising model on $Z^d$ dominate the same
set of product measures. We show that this latter fact fails completely on the
homogenous 3-ary tree. We also provide a different distinction between $Z^d$
and the homogenous 3-ary tree concerning stochastic domination and Ising
models; while it is known that the plus states for different temperatures on
$Z^d$ are never stochastically ordered, on the homogenous 3-ary tree, almost
the complete opposite is the case. Next, we show that on $Z^d$, the set of
product measures which the plus state for the Ising model dominates is strictly
increasing in the temperature. Finally, we obtain a necessary and sufficient
condition for a finite number of variables, which are both FKG and
exchangeable, to dominate a given product measure.
