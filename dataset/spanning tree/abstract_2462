A hyperbinary expansion of a positive integer n is a partition of n into
powers of 2 in which each part appears at most twice. In this paper, we
consider a generalization of this concept and a certain statistic on the
corresponding set of expansions of n. We then define q-generalized m-ary trees
whose vertices are labeled by ratios of two consecutive terms within the
sequence of distribution polynomials for the aforementioned statistic. When m =
2, we obtain a variant of a previously considered q-Calkin-Wilf tree.
