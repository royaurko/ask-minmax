We prove some relations for the $q$-multiple zeta values ($q$MZV). They are
$q$-analogues of the cyclic sum formula, the Ohno relation and the Ohno-Zagier
relation for the multiple zeta values (MZV). We discuss the problem to
determine the dimension of the space spanned by $q$MZV's over $\Q$, and present
an application to MZV.
