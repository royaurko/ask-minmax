There exists a generic minimal tree-level diagram, with two external scalars
and a heavy intermediate fermion, that can generate naturally small neutrino
masses via a seesaw. This diagram has a mass insertion on the internal fermion
line, and the set of such diagrams can be partitioned according to whether the
mass insertion is of the Majorana or Dirac type. We show that, once subjected
to the demands of naturalness (i.e. precluding small scalar vacuum expectation
values that require fine-tuning), this set is finite, and contains a relatively
small number of elements. Some of the corresponding models have appeared in the
literature. We present the remaining original models, thus generalizing the
Type-I and Type-III seesaws, and apparently exhausting the list of their
minimal non-tuned variants.
