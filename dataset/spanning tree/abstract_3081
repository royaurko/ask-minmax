One of the purposes of this paper is to clarify the strong analogy between
potential theory on the open unit disk and the homogeneous tree, to which we
dedicate an introductory section. We then exemplify this analogy by a study of
Riesz measures.
  Starting from interesting work by Favorov and Golinskii [A Blaschke-type
condition for analytic and subharmonic functions and application to contraction
operators. Linear and complex analysis, pp. 37-47, Amer. Math. Soc. Transl. (2)
226, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 2009], we consider subharmonic functions
on the open unit disk, resp. on the homogenous tree. Supposing that we can
control the way how those functions may tend to infinity at the boundary, we
derive moment type conditions for the Riesz measures. One one hand, we
generalise the previous results for the disk, and on the other hand, we show
how to obtain analogous results in the discrete setting of the tree.
