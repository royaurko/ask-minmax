We present a general approach connecting biased Maker-Breaker games and
problems about local resilience in random graphs. We utilize this approach to
prove new results and also to derive some known results about biased
Maker-Breaker games. In particular, we show that for
$b=o\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$, Maker can build a pancyclic graph (that is, a graph
that contains cycles of every possible length) while playing a $(1:b)$ game on
$E(K_n)$. As another application, we show that for $b=\Theta\left(n/\ln
n\right)$, playing a $(1:b)$ game on $E(K_n)$, Maker can build a graph which
contains copies of all spanning trees having maximum degree $\Delta=O(1)$ with
a bare path of linear length (a bare path in a tree $T$ is a path with all
interior vertices of degree exactly two in $T$).
