We analyze the magnetization and the overlap distributions on the
ferromagnetic Cayley tree. Two quantities are investigated: the asymptotic
scaling of all the moments of the magnetization and overlap distributions, as
well as the computation of the fractal dimension of the magnetization and
overlap probability measures.
