Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph with $n\ge 3$. A classic result of Dirac from
1952 asserts that $G$ is hamiltonian if $\delta(G)\ge n/2$. Dirac's theorem is
one of the most influential results in the study of hamiltonicity and by now
there are many related known results\,(see, e.g., J. A. Bondy, Basic Graph
Theory: Paths and Circuits, Chapter 1 in: {\it Handbook of Combinatorics
Vol.1}). A {\it Halin graph}, which consists of a plane tree with no vertices
of degree 2 and a cycle connecting its leaves according to the cyclic order
determined by the embedding, possesses rich hamiltonicity properties such as
being hamiltonian, hamiltonian connected, and almost pancyclic. As a continuous
"generalization" of Dirac's theorem, in this paper, we show that there exists a
positive integer $n_0$ such that any graph $G$ with $n\ge n_0$ vertices and
$\delta(G)\ge (n+1)/2$ contains a spanning Halin subgraph.
