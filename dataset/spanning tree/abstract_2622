The theory of Hubbard trees provides an effective classification of
non-linear post-critically finite polynomial maps from \C to itself. This note
will extend this classification to the case of maps from a finite union of
copies of \C to itself. Maps which are post-critically finite and nowhere
linear will be characterized by a ``forest'', which is made up out of one tree
in each copy of \C.
