Heap security has been a major concern since the past two decades. Recently
many methods have been proposed to secure heap i.e. to avoid heap overrun and
attacks. The paper describes a method suggested to secure heap at the operating
system level. Major emphasis is given to Solaris operating system's dynamic
memory manager. When memory is required dynamically during runtime, the
SysVmalloc acts as a memory allocator.Vmalloc allocates the chunks of memory in
the form of splay tree structure. A self adjusting binary tree structure is
reviewed in the paper, moreover major security issue to secure heap area is
also suggested in the paper
