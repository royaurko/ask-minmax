We solve the classical euclidean boundary value problem for tree-level
multiparticle production in $\phi^4$ theory at arbitrary energies in the case
of $O(4)$ symmetric field configurations. We reproduce known low-energy results
and obtain a lower bound on the tree cross sections at arbitrary energies.
