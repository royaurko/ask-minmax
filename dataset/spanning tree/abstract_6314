A poset can be regarded as a category in which there is at most one morphism
between objects, and such that at most one of Hom(c,c') and Hom(c',c) is
nonempty for c not equal to c'. If we keep in place the latter axiom but allow
for more than one morphism between objects, we can have a sort of generalized
poset in which there are multiplicities attached to the covering relations, and
possibly nontrivial automorphism groups. We call such a category an "updown
category." In this paper we give a precise definition of such categories and
develop a theory for them, which incorporates earlier notions of differential
posets and weighted-relation posets. We also give a detailed account of ten
examples, including the updown categories of integer partitions, integer
compositions, planar rooted trees, and rooted trees.
