We show that if a strictly positive joint probability distribution for a set
of binary random variables factors according to a tree, then vertex separation
represents all and only the independence relations enclosed in the
distribution. The same result is shown to hold also for multivariate strictly
positive normal distributions. Our proof uses a new property of conditional
independence that holds for these two classes of probability distributions.
