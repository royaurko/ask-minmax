As well as arising naturally in the study of non-intersecting random paths,
random spanning trees, and eigenvalues of random matrices, determinantal point
processes (sometimes also called fermionic point processes) are relatively easy
to simulate and provide a quite broad class of models that exhibit repulsion
between points. The fundamental ingredient used to construct a determinantal
point process is a kernel giving the pairwise interactions between points: the
joint distribution of any number of points then has a simple expression in
terms of determinants of certain matrices defined from this kernel. In this
paper we initiate the study of an analogous class of point processes that are
defined in terms of a kernel giving the interaction between $2M$ points for
some integer $M$. The role of matrices is now played by $2M$-dimensional
"hypercubic" arrays, and the determinant is replaced by a suitable
generalization of it to such arrays -- Cayley's first hyperdeterminant. We show
that some of the desirable features of determinantal point processes continue
to be exhibited by this generalization.
