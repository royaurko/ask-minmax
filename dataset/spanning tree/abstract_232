We study approaches for the exact solution of the \NP--hard minimum spanning
tree problem under conflict constraints. Given a graph $G(V,E)$ and a set $C
\subset E \times E$ of conflicting edge pairs, the problem consists of finding
a conflict-free minimum spanning tree, i.e. feasible solutions are allowed to
include at most one of the edges from each pair in $C$. The problem was
introduced recently in the literature, with several results on its complexity
and approximability. Some formulations and both exact and heuristic algorithms
were also discussed, but computational results indicate considerably large
duality gaps and a lack of optimality certificates for benchmark instances. In
this paper, we build on the representation of conflict constraints using an
auxiliary conflict graph $\hat{G}(E,C)$, where stable sets correspond to
conflict-free subsets of $E$. We introduce a general preprocessing method and a
branch and cut algorithm using an IP formulation with exponentially sized
classes of valid inequalities for both the spanning tree and the stable set
polytopes. Encouraging computational results indicate that the dual bounds of
our approach are significantly stronger than those previously available,
already in the initial LP relaxation, and we are able to provide new
feasibility and optimality certificates.
