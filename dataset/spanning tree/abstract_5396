An investigation of the distribution of finite time trajectory divergence is
performed on an Atmospheric Global Circulation Model. The distribution of the
largest local Lyapunov exponent shows a significant probability for negative
values over time spans up to 10 days. This effect is present for resolutions up
to wave numbers l=42 (~ 250km). The probability for a negative local largest
Lyapunov exponent decreases over time, similarly to the predictions of the
Fluctuation Theorem for entropy production. The model used is hydrostatic with
variable numbers of vertical levels and different horizontal resolutions.
