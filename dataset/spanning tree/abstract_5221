Accurate {\it ab initio} calculations have been carried out to study the
valence electron removal energies and oscillator strengths of astrophysically
important electromagnetic transitions of quadruply ionized vanadium, $V^{4+}$.
Many important electron correlations are considered to all-orders using the
relativistic coupled-cluster theory. Calculated ionization potentials and fine
structure splittings are compared with the experimental values, wherever
available. To our knowledge, oscillator strengths of electric dipole
transitions are predicted for the first time for most of the transitions. The
transitions span in the range of ultraviolet, visible and near infrared regions
and are important for astrophysical observations.
