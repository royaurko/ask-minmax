For $f,g\in\omega^\omega$ let $c^\forall_{f,g}$ be the minimal number of
uniform $g$-splitting trees needed to cover the uniform $f$-splitting tree,
i.e., for every branch $\nu$ of the $f$-tree, one of the $g$-trees contains
$\nu$. Let $c^\exists_{f,g}$ be the dual notion: For every branch $\nu$, one of
the $g$-trees guesses $\nu(m)$ infinitely often. We show that it is consistent
that
$c^\exists_{f_\epsilon,g_\epsilon}=c^\forall_{f_\epsilon,g_\epsilon}=\kappa_\epsilon$
for continuum many pairwise different cardinals $\kappa_\epsilon$ and suitable
pairs $(f_\epsilon,g_\epsilon)$. For the proof we introduce a new mixed-limit
creature forcing construction.
