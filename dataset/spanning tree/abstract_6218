Tree-level Flavor-Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC) are characteristic of
models with extra vector-like quarks. These new couplings can strongly modify
the B^0 CP asymmetries without conflicting with low--energy constraints. In the
light of a low CP asymmetry in B --> J/\psi K_{S}, we discuss the implications
of these contributions. We find that even these low values can be easily
accommodated in these models. Furthermore, we show that the new data from B
factories tend to favor an O(20) enhancement of the b --> d l \bar{l}
transition over the SM expectation.
