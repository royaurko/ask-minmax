Motivated by the definition of Duflo involution for fiat $2$-categories, we
define certain analogues of Duflo involution for arbitrary finitary
$2$-categories and show that such Duflo involutions exist for two classes of
finitary $2$-categories associated with tree path algebras. Additionally, we
describe the quiver for the algebra underlying the principal $2$-representation
for these two classes of finitary $2$-categories.
