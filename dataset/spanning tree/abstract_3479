Recently a new recursion relation for tree-level gluon amplitudes in gauge
theory has been discovered. We solve this recursion to obtain explicit formulas
for the closed set of amplitudes with arbitrarily many positive and negative
helicity gluons in a split helicity configuration. The solution admits a simple
diagrammatic expansion in terms of zigzag diagrams. We comment on
generalizations of this result.
