Let $P$ and $S$ be two disjoint sets of $n$ and $m$ points in the plane,
respectively. We consider the problem of computing a Steiner tree whose Steiner
vertices belong to $S$, in which each point of $P$ is a leaf, and whose longest
edge length is minimum. We present an algorithm that computes such a tree in
$O((n+m)\log m)$ time, improving the previously best result by a logarithmic
factor. We also prove a matching lower bound in the algebraic computation tree
model.
