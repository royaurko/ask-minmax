The Simplex Tree (ST) is a recently introduced data structure that can
represent abstract simplicial complexes of any dimension and allows efficient
implementation of a large range of basic operations on simplicial complexes. In
this paper, we show how to optimally compress the Simplex Tree while retaining
its functionalities. In addition, we propose two new data structures called the
Maximal Simplex Tree (MxST) and the Simplex Array List (SAL). We analyze the
compressed Simplex Tree, the Maximal Simplex Tree, and the Simplex Array List
under various settings.
