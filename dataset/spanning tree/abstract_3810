Solving (for tame matroids) a problem of Aigner-Horev, Diestel and Postle, we
prove that every tame matroid M can be reconstructed from its canonical tree
decomposition into 3-connected pieces, circuits and cocircuits together with
information about which ends of the decomposition tree are used by M .
  For every locally finite graph G, we show that every tame matroid whose
circuits are topological circles of G and whose cocircuits are bonds of G is
determined by the set Psi of ends it uses, that is, it is a Psi-matroid.
