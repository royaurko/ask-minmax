We give examples of intercategories, a special kind of lax triple category.
These include duoidal categories, monoidal double categories, cubical
bicategories, Verity double bicategories, Gray categories and natural
generalizations of these. We also consider some general constructions such as
spans in a double category and notions of monad and hom functor in the
intercategory setting.
