For a harmonic function on a tree with random walk whose transition
probabilities are bounded between two constants in (0,1/2), it is known that
the radial and stochastic properties of convergence, boundedness and finiteness
of energy are all a.s. equivalent. We prove here that the analogous
non-tangential properties are a.e. equivalent to the above ones.
