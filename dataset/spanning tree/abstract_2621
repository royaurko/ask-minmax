For g < f in omega^omega we define c(f,g) be the least number of uniform
trees with g-splitting needed to cover a uniform tree with f-splitting. We
show that we can simultaneously force aleph_1 many different values for
different functions (f,g). In the language of Blass: There may be aleph_1 many
distinct uniform Pi^0_1 characteristics.
