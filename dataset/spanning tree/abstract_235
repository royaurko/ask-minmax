Given natural limitations on the length DNA sequences, designing phylogenetic
reconstruction methods which are reliable under limited information is a
crucial endeavor. There have been two approaches to this problem:
reconstructing partial but reliable information about the tree (\cite{Mo07,
DMR08,DHJ06,GMS08}), and reaching "deeper" in the tree through reconstruction
of ancestral sequences. In the latter category, \cite{DMR06} settled an
important conjecture of M.Steel, showing that, under the CFN model of
evolution, all trees on $n$ leaves with edge lengths bounded by the Ising model
phase transition can be recovered with high probability from genomes of length
$O(\log n)$ with a polynomial time algorithm. Their methods had a running time
of $O(n^{10})$.
  Here we enhance our methods from \cite{DHJ06} with the learning of ancestral
sequences and provide an algorithm for reconstructing a sub-forest of the tree
which is reliable given available data, without requiring a-priori known bounds
on the edge lengths of the tree. Our methods are based on an intuitive minimum
spanning tree approach and run in $O(n^3)$ time. For the case of full
reconstruction of trees with edges under the phase transition, we maintain the
same sequence length requirements as \cite{DMR06}, despite the considerably
faster running time.
