One of the most famous algorithmic meta-theorems states that every graph
property that can be defined by a sentence in counting monadic second order
logic (CMSOL) can be checked in linear time for graphs of bounded treewidth,
which is known as Courcelle's Theorem. These algorithms are constructed as
finite state tree automata, and hence every CMSOL-definable graph property is
recognizable. Courcelle also conjectured that the converse holds, i.e. every
recognizable graph property is definable in CMSOL for graphs of bounded
treewidth. We prove this conjecture for a number of special cases in a stronger
form. That is, we show that each recognizable property is definable in MSOL,
i.e. the counting operation is not needed in our expressions. We give proofs
for Halin graphs, bounded degree $k$-outerplanar graphs and some related graph
classes. We furthermore show that the conjecture holds for any graph class that
admits tree decompositions that can be defined in MSOL, thus providing a useful
tool for future proofs.
