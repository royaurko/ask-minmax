Tridendriform algebras are a type of associative algebras, introduced
independently by F. Chapoton and by J.-L. Loday and the third contributor, in order
to describe operads related to the Stasheff polytopes. The vector space $\st$
spanned by the faces of permutohedra has a natural structure of tridendriform
bialgebra, we prove that it is free as a tridendriform algebra and exhibit a
basis. Our result implies that the subspace of primitive elements of the
coalgebra $\st$ , equipped with the coboundary map of permutohedra, is a free
cacti algebra.
