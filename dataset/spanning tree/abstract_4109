The algorithm analysed by Na\"{i}mi, Trehe and Arnold was the very first
distributed algorithm to solve the mutual exclusion problem in complete
networks by using a dynamic logical tree structure as its basic distributed
data structure, viz. a path reversal transformation in rooted n-node trees;
besides, it was also the first one to achieve a logarithmic average-case
message complexity. The present paper proposes a direct and general approach to
compute the moments of the cost of path reversal. It basically uses one-one
correspondences between combinatorial structures and the associated probability
generating functions: the expected cost of path reversal is thus proved to be
exactly $H_{n-1}$. Moreover, time and message complexity of the algorithm as
well as randomized bounds on its worst-case message complexity in arbitrary
networks are also given. The average-case analysis of path reversal and the
analysis of this distributed algorithm for mutual exclusion are thus fully
completed in the paper. The general techniques used should also prove available
and fruitful when adapted to the most efficient recent tree-based distributed
algorithms for mutual exclusion which require powerful tools, particularly for
average-case analyses.
