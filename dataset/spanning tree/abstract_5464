We construct a representation of each finitely aligned aperiodic k-graph
\Lambda\ on the Hilbert space H^{ap} with basis indexed by aperiodic boundary
paths in \Lambda. We show that the canonical expectation on B(H^{ap}) restricts
to an expectation of the image of this representation onto the subalgebra
spanned by the final projections of the generating partial isometries. We then
show that every quotient of the Toeplitz algebra of the k-graph admits an
expectation compatible with this one. Using this, we prove that the image of
our representation, which is canonically isomorphic to the Cuntz-Krieger
algebra, is co-universal for Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger families consisting of
nonzero partial isometries.
