The neutralino-nucleon (\tilde{\chi}^0-N) scattering is an important process
for direct dark matter searches. In this paper we discuss one-loop
contributions to the cross section in the wino-like and Higgsino-like LSP
cases. The neutralino-nucleon scattering mediated by the Higgs
\tilde{\chi}^0\tilde{\chi}^0 and Z\tilde{\chi}^0\tilde{\chi}^0 couplings at
tree level is suppressed by the gaugino-Higgsino mixing at tree level when the
neutralino is close to a weak eigenstate. The one-loop contribution to the
cross section, generated by the gauge interaction, is not suppressed by any
SUSY particle mass or mixing in the wino- and Higgsino-like LSP cases. It may
significantly alter the total cross section when \sigma_{\tilde{\chi}^0 N}\sim
10^{-45} cm^2 or less.
