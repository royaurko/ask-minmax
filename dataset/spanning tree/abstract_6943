The tree-level two-point amplitudes for the transitions $jf \to j^{\, \prime}
f^{\, \prime}$, where $f$ is a fermion and $j$ is a generalized current, in a
constant uniform magnetic field of an arbitrary strength and in charged fermion
plasma, for the $jff$ interaction vertices of the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector
and axial-vector types have been calculated. The generalized current $j$ could
mean the field operator of a boson, or a current consisting of fermions, e.g.
the neutrino current. The particular cases of a very strong magnetic field, and
of the coherent scattering off the real fermions without change of their states
(the "forward" scattering) have been analysed. The contribution of the neutrino
photoproduction process, $\gamma e\to e \nu \bar \nu$, to the neutrino
emissivity has been calculated with taking account of a possible resonance on
the virtual electron.
