The generating function for spanning forests on a lattice is related to the
q-state Potts model in a certain q -> 0 limit, and extends the analogous notion
for spanning trees, or dense self-avoiding branched polymers. Recent works have
found a combinatorial perturbative equivalence also with the (quadratic action)
O(n) model in the limit n -> -1, the expansion parameter t counting the number
of components in the forest. We give a random-matrix formulation of this model
on the ensemble of degree-k random planar lattices. For k = 3, a correspondence
is found with the Kostov solution of the loop-gas problem, which arise as a
reformulation of the (logarithmic action) O(n) model, at n = -2. Then, we show
how to perform an expansion around the t = 0 theory. In the thermodynamic
limit, at any order in t we have a finite sum of finite-dimensional Cauchy
integrals. The leading contribution comes from a peculiar class of terms, for
which a resummation can be performed exactly.
