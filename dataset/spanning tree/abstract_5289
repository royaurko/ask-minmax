A higher-order multiscale analysis of the dissipation range of collisionless
plasma turbulence is presented using in-situ high-frequency magnetic field
measurements from the Cluster spacecraft in a stationary interval of fast
ambient solar wind. The observations, spanning five decades in temporal scales,
show a crossover from multifractal intermittent turbulence in the inertial
range to non-Gaussian monoscaling in the dissipation range. This presents a
strong observational constraint on theories of dissipation mechanisms in
turbulent collisionless plasmas.
