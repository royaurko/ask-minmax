UPGMA is a heuristic method identifying the least squares equidistant
phylogenetic tree given empirical distance data among $n$ taxa. We study this
classic algorithm using the geometry of the space of all equidistant trees with
$n$ leaves, also known as the Bergman complex of the graphical matroid for the
complete graph $K_n$. We show that UPGMA performs an orthogonal projection of
the data onto a maximal cell of the Bergman complex. We also show that the
equidistant tree with the least (Euclidean) distance from the data is obtained
from such an orthogonal projection, but not necessarily given by UPGMA. Using
this geometric information we give an extension of the UPGMA algorithm. We also
present a branch and bound method for finding the best equidistant tree.
Finally, we prove that there are distance data among $n$ taxa which project to
at least $(n-1)!$ equidistant trees.
