We explore resolutions of monomial ideals supported by simplicial trees. We
argue that since simplicial trees are acyclic, the criterion of Bayer, Peeva
and Sturmfels for checking if a simplicial complex supports a free resolution
of a monomial ideal reduces to checking that certain induced subcomplexes are
connected. We then use results of Peeva and Velasco to show that every
simplicial tree appears as the Scarf complex of a monomial ideal, and hence
supports a minimal resolution. We also provide a way to construct smaller Scarf
ideals than those constructed by Peeva and Velasco.
