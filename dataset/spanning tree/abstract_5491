A plasma transport theory that spans weak to strong coupling is developed
from a binary collision picture, but where the interaction potential is taken
to be an effective potential that includes correlation effects and screening
self-consistently. This physically motivated approach provides a practical
model for evaluating transport coefficients across coupling regimes. The theory
is shown to compare well with classical molecular dynamics simulations of
temperature relaxation in electron-ion plasmas, as well as simulations and
experiments of self-diffusion in one component plasmas. The approach is
versatile and can be applied to other transport coefficients as well.
