Recent theory work has found that a special type of spatial partition tree -
called a random projection tree - is adaptive to the intrinsic dimension of the
data from which it is built. Here we examine this same question, with a
combination of theory and experiments, for a broader class of trees that
includes k-d trees, dyadic trees, and PCA trees. Our motivation is to get a
feel for (i) the kind of intrinsic low dimensional structure that can be
empirically verified, (ii) the extent to which a spatial partition can exploit
such structure, and (iii) the implications for standard statistical tasks such
as regression, vector quantization, and nearest neighbor search.
