The recently discovered FeAs-based superconductors show intriguing behavior
and unusual dynamics of electrons and holes which occupy the Fe $d$-orbitals
and As $4s$ and $4p$ orbitals. Starting from the atomic limit, we carry out a
strong coupling expansion to derive an effective hamiltonian that describes the
electron and hole behavior. The hopping and the hybridization parameters
between the Fe $d$ and As $s$ and $p$-orbitals are obtained by fitting the
results of our density-functional-theory calculations to a tight-binding model
with nearest-neighbor interactions and a minimal orbital basis. We find that
the effective hamiltonian, in the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion limit,
operates on three distinct sub-spaces coupled through Hund's rule. The three
sub-spaces describe different components (or subsystems): (a) one spanned by
the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Fe orbital; (b) one spanned by the degenerate atomic Fe
orbitals $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$; and (c) one spanned by the atomic Fe orbitals
$d_{xy}$ and $d_{z^2}$. Each of these Hamiltonians is an extended t-t'-J-J'
model and is characterized by different coupling constants and filling factors.
For the case of the undoped material the second subspace alone prefers a ground
state characterized by a spin-density-wave order similar to that observed in
recent experimental studies, while the other two subspaces prefer an
antiferromagnetic order. We argue that the observed spin-density-wave order
minimizes the ground state energy of the total hamiltonian.
