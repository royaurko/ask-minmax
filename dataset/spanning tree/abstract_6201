We consider the subtleties involved in the application of the Equivalence
Theorem to the decay of an unstable Higgs particle. This is formally justified
from consideration of unitarity and resonant elastic scattering of the stable
decay products. By explicit perturbative calculation we find that the imaginary
parts of the one-loop amplitudes for that decay are in agreement with the
Equivlence Theorem only when one includes the imaginary parts generated by
evaluatuing the tree-level amplitudes at the complex on-shell value of the
four-momentum squared of the unstable particle.
