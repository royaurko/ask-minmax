We consider a continuous-time vertex reinforced jump process on a
supercritical Galton-Watson tree. This process takes values in the set of
vertices of the tree and jumps to a neighboring vertex with rate proportional
to the local time at that vertex plus a constant $c$. The walk is either
transient or recurrent depending on this parameter $c$. In this paper, we
complete results previously obtained by Davis and Volkov [Probab. Theory
Related Fields 123 (2002) 281-300, Probab. Theory Related Fields 128 (2004)
42-62] and Collevecchio [Ann. Probab. 34 (2006) 870-878, Electron. J. Probab.
14 (2009) 1936-1962] by proving that there is a unique (explicit) positive
$c_{\mathrm{crit}}$ such that the walk is recurrent for $c\leq
c_{\mathrm{crit}}$ and transient for $c>c_{\mathrm{crit}}$.
