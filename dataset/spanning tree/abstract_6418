We evaluate all split helicity gluon tree amplitudes in open twistor string
theory. We show that these amplitudes satisfy the BCFW recurrence relations
restricted to the split helicity case and, hence, that these amplitudes agree
with those of gauge theory. To do this we make a particular choice of the
sextic constraints in the link variables that determine the poles contributing
to the contour integral expression for the amplitudes. Using the residue
theorem to re-express this integral in terms of contributions from poles at
rational values of the link variables, which we determine, we evaluate the
amplitudes explicitly, regaining the gauge theory results of Britto et al.
