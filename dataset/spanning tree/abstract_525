We present a complete systematic theoretical study of multifragmentation and
its associated phenomena in heavy ion collisions. This study is performed
within an Isospin dependent Quantum Molecular Dynamical Model (IQMD) and using
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm. Simulations are carried out to study the
different parameters like time evolution of multiplicity, mass distribution,
impact parameter dependence and IMF's production dependence of projectile &
target mass. The rise and fall in multiplicity of IMF's is observed. Results
are compared with experimental data of ALADIN and are found to be in close
agreement.
