In this paper, we introduce the notion of a grammatical labeling to describe
a recursive process of generating combinatorial objects based on a context-free
grammar. For example, by labeling the ascents and descents of a Stirling
permutation, we obtain a grammar for the second-order Eulerian polynomials. By
using the grammar for $0$-$1$-$2$ increasing trees given by Dumont, we obtain a
grammatical derivation of the generating function of the Andr\'e polynomials
obtained by Foata and Sch\"utzenberger, without solving a differential
equation. We also find a grammar for the number $T(n,k)$ of permutations of
$[n]=\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$ with $k$ exterior peaks, which was independently
discovered by Ma. We demonstrate that Gessel's formula for the generating
function of $T(n,k)$ can be deduced from this grammar. Moreover, by using
grammars we show that the number of the permutations of $[n]$ with $k$ exterior
peaks equals the number of increasing trees on $[n]$ with $2k+1$ vertices of
even degree. A combinatorial proof of this fact is also presented.
