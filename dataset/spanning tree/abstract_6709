In this paper we present the first provable approximate nearest-neighbor
(ANN) algorithms for Bregman divergences. Our first algorithm processes queries
in O(log^d n) time using O(n log^d n) space and only uses general properties of
the underlying distance function (which includes Bregman divergences as a
special case). The second algorithm processes queries in O(log n) time using
O(n) space and exploits structural constants associated specifically with
Bregman divergences. An interesting feature of our algorithms is that they
extend the ring-tree + quad-tree paradigm for ANN searching beyond Euclidean
distances and metrics of bounded doubling dimension to distances that might not
even be symmetric or satisfy a triangle inequality.
