For a set of points in the plane and a fixed integer $k > 0$, the Yao graph
$Y_k$ partitions the space around each point into $k$ equiangular cones of
angle $\theta=2\pi/k$, and connects each point to a nearest neighbor in each
cone. It is known for all Yao graphs, with the sole exception of $Y_5$, whether
or not they are geometric spanners. In this paper we close this gap by showing
that for odd $k \geq 5$, the spanning ratio of $Y_k$ is at most
$1/(1-2\sin(3\theta/8))$, which gives the first constant upper bound for $Y_5$,
and is an improvement over the previous bound of $1/(1-2\sin(\theta/2))$ for
odd $k \geq 7$. We further reduce the upper bound on the spanning ratio for
$Y_5$ from $10.9$ to $2+\sqrt{3} \approx 3.74$, which falls slightly below the
lower bound of $3.79$ established for the spanning ratio of $\Theta_5$
($\Theta$-graphs differ from Yao graphs only in the way they select the closest
neighbor in each cone). This is the first such separation between a Yao and
$\Theta$-graph with the same number of cones. We also give a lower bound of
$2.87$ on the spanning ratio of $Y_5$. Finally, we revisit the $Y_6$ graph,
which plays a particularly important role as the transition between the graphs
($k > 6$) for which simple inductive proofs are known, and the graphs ($k \le
6$) whose best spanning ratios have been established by complex arguments. Here
we reduce the known spanning ratio of $Y_6$ from $17.6$ to $5.8$, getting
closer to the spanning ratio of 2 established for $\Theta_6$.
