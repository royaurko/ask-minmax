In an earlier paper we introduced a special kind of k-width junction tree,
called k-th order t-cherry junction tree in order to approximate a joint
probability distribution. The approximation is the best if the Kullback-Leibler
divergence between the true joint probability distribution and the
approximating one is minimal. Finding the best approximating k-width junction
tree is NP-complete if k>2. In our earlier paper we also proved that the best
approximating k-width junction tree can be embedded into a k-th order t-cherry
junction tree. We introduce a greedy algorithm resulting very good
approximations in reasonable computing time.
  In this paper we prove that if the Markov network underlying fullfills some
requirements then our greedy algorithm is able to find the true probability
distribution or its best approximation in the family of the k-th order t-cherry
tree probability distributions. Our algorithm uses just the k-th order marginal
probability distributions as input.
  We compare the results of the greedy algorithm proposed in this paper with
the greedy algorithm proposed by Malvestuto in 1991.
