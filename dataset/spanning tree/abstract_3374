In this paper we present a fully lexicalized grammar formalism as a
particularly attractive framework for the specification of natural language
grammars. We discuss in detail Feature-based, Lexicalized Tree Adjoining
Grammars (FB-LTAGs), a representative of the class of lexicalized grammars. We
illustrate the advantages of lexicalized grammars in various contexts of
natural language processing, ranging from wide-coverage grammar development to
parsing and machine translation. We also present a method for compact and
efficient representation of lexicalized trees.
