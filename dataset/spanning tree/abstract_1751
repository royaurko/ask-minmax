A tree-strip of finite cone type is the product of a tree of finite cone type
with a finite set. We consider random Schr\"odinger operators on these tree
strips, similar to the Anderson model. We prove that for small disorder the
spectrum is almost surely, purely, absolutely continuous in a certain set.
