Large deviation principles and related results are given for a class of
Markov chains associated to the "leaves" in random recursive trees and
preferential attachment random graphs, as well as the "cherries" in Yule trees.
  In particular, the method of proof, combining analytic and Dupuis-Ellis type
path arguments, allows for an explicit computation of the large deviation
pressure.
