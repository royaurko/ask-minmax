We report on a joint RXTE and ASCA observation spanning $\sim$ 400~ks of the
Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG--6-30-15. The low energy coverage of ASCA coupled with the
high energy coverage of RXTE have allowed us not only to confirm features of
Compton reflection but also to set bounds on the abundances as a function of
reflective fraction.
