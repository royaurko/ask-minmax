We study spanning trees on Sierpinski graphs (i.e., finite approximations to
the Sierpinski gasket) that are chosen uniformly at random. We construct a
joint probability space for uniform spanning trees on every finite Sierpinski
graph and show that this construction gives rise to a multi-type Galton-Watson
tree. We derive a number of structural results, for instance on the degree
distribution. The connection between uniform spanning trees and loop-erased
random walk is then exploited to prove convergence of the latter to a
continuous stochastic process. Some geometric properties of this limit process,
such as the Hausdorff dimension, are investigated as well. The method is also
applicable to other self-similar graphs with a sufficient degree of symmetry.
