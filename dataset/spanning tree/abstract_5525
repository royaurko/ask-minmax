We introduce a new method for the reconstruction of a function from linear
measurements by means of oblique projections. The space spanned by the
measurement vectors may be different from the subspace in which the function is
reconstructed. This method is a variation of the generalized sampling of Adcock
and Hansen. In many cases the use of suitable oblique projections yield a
better quasi-optimality constants than in generalized sampling.
