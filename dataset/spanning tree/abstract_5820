We explore an extension of the fourth generation model with multi-Higgs
doublets and three fermion singlets. The Standard Model neutrinos acquire mass
radiatively at one loop level while the fourth generation neutrinos acquire a
heavy tree-level mass. The model also contains several Dark Matter candidate
whose stability is guaranteed by a $Z_2$ discrete symmetry. The possibility of
CP violation in the scalar sector is also briefly discussed.
