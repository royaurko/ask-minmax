Much of extremal graph theory has concentrated either on finding very small
subgraphs of a large graph (Turan-type results) or on finding spanning
subgraphs (Dirac-type results). In this paper we are interested in finding
intermediate-sized subgraphs. We investigate minimum degree conditions under
which a graph G contains squared paths and squared cycles of arbitrary
specified lengths. We determine precise thresholds, assuming that the order of
G is large. This extends results of Fan and Kierstead [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B
63 (1995), 55--64] and of Komlos, Sarkozy, and Szemeredi [Random Structures
Algorithms 9 (1996), 193--211] concerning the containment of a spanning squared
path and a spanning squared cycle, respectively. Our results show that such
minimum degree conditions constitute not merely an interpolation between the
corresponding Turan-type and Dirac-type results, but exhibit other interesting
phenomena.
