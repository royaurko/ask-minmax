We investigate the tree level multi-gluon components of the gluon light cone
wavefunctions in the light cone gauge keeping the exact kinematics of the gluon
emissions. We focus on the components with all helicities identical to the
helicity of the incoming gluon. The recurrence relations for the gluon
wavefunctions are derived. In the case when the virtuality of the incoming
gluon is neglected the exact form of the multi-gluon wavefunction as well as
the fragmentation function is obtained. Furthermore we analyze the 2 to N
tree-level gluon scattering in the framework of light-front perturbation theory
and we demonstrate that the amplitude for this process can be obtained from the
1 to N+1 gluon wavefunction. Finally, we demonstrate that our results for
selected helicity configurations are equivalent to the Parke-Taylor amplitudes.
