Given a directed graph $G=(V,A)$, the Directed Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree
problem asks to compute a directed spanning tree (i.e., an out-branching) with
as many leaves as possible. By designing a Branch-and-Reduced algorithm
combined with the Measure & Conquer technique for running time analysis, we
show that the problem can be solved in time $\Oh^*(1.9043^n)$ using polynomial
space. Hitherto, there have been only few examples. Provided exponential space
this run time upper bound can be lowered to $\Oh^*(1.8139^n)$.
