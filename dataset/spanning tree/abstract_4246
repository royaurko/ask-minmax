The free abelian group R(Q) on the set of indecomposable representations of a
quiver Q, over a field K, has a ring structure where the multiplication is
given by the tensor product. We show that if Q is a rooted tree (an oriented
tree with a unique sink), then the ring $R(Q)_{red}$ is a finitely generated
$\Z$-module (here $R(Q)_{red}$ is the ring R(Q) modulo the ideal of all
nilpotent elements). We will describe the ring $R(Q)_{red}$ explicitly, by
studying functors from the category Rep(Q) of representations of Q over K to
the category of finite dimensional K-vector spaces. We also present an open
problem for future direction.
