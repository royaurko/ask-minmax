To any real rational function with generic ramification points we assign a
combinatorial object, called a garden, which consists of a weighted labeled
directed planar chord diagram and of a set of weighted rooted trees each
corresponding to a face of the diagram. We prove that any garden corresponds to
a generic real rational function, and that equivalent functions have equivalent
gardens.
