In this paper we characterize the elements of PSL(2,Z), as a subgroup of
Thompson group T, in the language of reduced tree pair diagrams and in terms of
piecewise linear maps as well. Actually, we construct the reduced tree pair
diagram for every element of PSL(2,Z) in normal form. This allows us to
estimate the length of the elements of PSL(2,Z) through the number of carets of
their reduced tree pair diagrams and, as a consequence, to prove that PSL(2,Z)
is a non distorted subgroup of T. In particular, we find non-distorted free non
abelian subgroups of T.
