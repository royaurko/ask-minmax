We analyse the differences between inert and pseudo-inert vacua in the 2HDM,
both at tree-level and one-loop. The validity of tree-level formulae for the
relative depth of the potential at both minima is studied. The one-loop
analysis shows both minima can coexist in regions of parameter space forbidden
at tree-level.
