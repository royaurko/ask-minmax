We consider a transient random walk $(X_n)$ in random environment on a
Galton--Watson tree. Under fairly general assumptions, we give a sharp and
explicit criterion for the asymptotic speed to be positive. As a consequence,
situations with zero speed are revealed to occur. In such cases, we prove that
$X_n$ is of order of magnitude $n^{\Lambda}$, with $\Lambda \in (0,1)$. We also
show that the linearly edge reinforced random walk on a regular tree always has
a positive asymptotic speed, which improves a recent result of Collevecchio
\cite{Col06}.
