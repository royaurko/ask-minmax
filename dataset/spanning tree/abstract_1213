We find sharp conditions on the growth of a rooted regular metric tree such
that the Neumann Laplacian on the tree satisfies a Hardy inequality. In
particular, we consider homogeneous metric trees. Moreover, we show that a
non-trivial Aharonov-Bohm magnetic field leads to a Hardy inequality on a loop
graph.
