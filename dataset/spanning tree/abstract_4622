If a Banach space is saturated with basic sequences whose linear span embeds
into the linear span of any subsequence, then it contains a minimal subspace.
It follows that any Banach space is either ergodic or contains a minimal
subspace.
  For a Banach space $X$ with an (unconditional) basis, topological 0-1 law
type dichotomies are stated for block-subspaces of $X$ as well as for subspaces
of $X$ with a successive FDD on its basis. A uniformity principle for
properties of block-sequences, results about block-homogeneity, and a possible
method to construct a Banach space with an unconditional basis, which has a
complemented subspace without an unconditional basis, are deduced.
