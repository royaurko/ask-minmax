In this paper we investigate undirected discrete graphical tree models when
all the variables in the system are binary, where leaves represent the
observable variables and where all the inner nodes are unobserved. A novel
approach based on the theory of partially ordered sets allows us to obtain a
convenient parametrization of this model class. The construction of the
proposed coordinate system mirrors the combinatorial definition of cumulants. A
simple product-like form of the resulting parametrization gives insight into
identifiability issues associated with this model class. In particular, we
provide necessary and sufficient conditions for such a model to be identified
up to the switching of labels of the inner nodes. When these conditions hold,
we give explicit formulas for the parameters of the model. Whenever the model
fails to be identified, we use the new parametrization to describe the geometry
of the unidentified parameter space. We illustrate these results using a simple
example.
