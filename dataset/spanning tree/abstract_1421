Treemaps are a popular technique to visualize hierarchical data. The input is
a weighted tree $\tree$ where the weight of each node is the sum of the weights
of its children. A treemap for $\tree$ is a hierarchical partition of a
rectangle into simply connected regions, usually rectangles. Each region
represents a node of $\tree$ and its area is proportional to the weight of the
corresponding node. An important quality criterion for treemaps is the aspect
ratio of its regions. One cannot bound the aspect ratio if the regions are
restricted to be rectangles. In contrast, \emph{polygonal partitions}, that use
convex polygons, have bounded aspect ratio. We are the first to obtain convex
partitions with optimal aspect ratio $O(\depth(\tree))$. However,
$\depth(\tree)$ still depends on the input tree. Hence we introduce a new type
of treemaps, namely \emph{orthoconvex treemaps}, where regions representing
leaves are rectangles, L-, and S-shapes, and regions representing internal
nodes are orthoconvex polygons. We prove that any input tree, irrespective of
the weights of the nodes and the depth of the tree, admits an orthoconvex
treemap of constant aspect ratio. We also obtain several specialized results
for single-level treemaps, that is, treemaps where the input tree has depth~1.
