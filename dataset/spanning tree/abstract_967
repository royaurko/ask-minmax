Coalescent histories are combinatorial structures that describe for a given
gene tree and species tree the possible lists of branches of the species tree
on which the gene tree coalescences take place. Properties of the number of
coalescent histories for gene trees and species trees affect a variety of
probabilistic calculations in mathematical phylogenetics. Exact and asymptotic
evaluations of the number of coalescent histories, however, are known only in a
limited number of cases. Here we introduce a particular family of species
trees, the \emph{lodgepole} species trees $(\lambda_n)_{n\geq 0}$, in which
tree $\lambda_n$ has $m=2n+1$ taxa. We determine the number of coalescent
histories for the lodgepole species trees, in the case that the gene tree
matches the species tree, showing that this number grows with $m!!$ in the
number of taxa $m$. This computation demonstrates the existence of tree
families in which the growth in the number of coalescent histories is faster
than exponential. Further, it provides a substantial improvement on the lower
bound for the ratio of the largest number of matching coalescent histories to
the smallest number of matching coalescent histories for trees with $m$ taxa,
increasing a previous bound of $(\sqrt{\pi} / 32)[(5m-12)/(4m-6)] m \sqrt{m}$
to $[ \sqrt{m-1}/(4 \sqrt{e}) ]^{m}$. We discuss the implications of our
enumerative results for phylogenetic computations.
