Let ${\mathcal H}$ be the group of isotopy classes of orientation preserving
homeomorphisms of $S^3$ that preserve a Heegaard splitting of genus two. In
this paper, we use a tree in the barycentric subdivision of the disk complex of
a handlebody of the splitting to obtain a finite presentation of ${\mathcal
H}$.
