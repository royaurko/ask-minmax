We develop a tool for embedding almost spanning degenerate graphs of small
bandwidth. As an application, we extend the blow-up lemma to degenerate graphs
of small bandwidth, the bandwidth theorem to degenerate graphs, and make
progress on a conjecture of Burr and Erd\H{o}s on Ramsey number of degenerate
graphs.
