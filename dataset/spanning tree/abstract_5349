I describe the monodromy of smooth hypersurfaces $X$ of high degree in a
fixed smooth variety $Y$ containing a fixed subvariety $W$ of $Y$. The
cohomology of $X$ in middle degree spanned by the pull-back of the cohomology
of $Y$ and by the classes of the irreducible components of $W$ is monodromy
invariant. I show that the monodromy representation on the orthogonal of those
classes is irreducible. The proof is essentially topological. Difficulties
arise from the fact that $W$ may have arbitrary singularities.
