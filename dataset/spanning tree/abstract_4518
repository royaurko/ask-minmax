We present a new exact algorithm for the Steiner tree problem in
edge-weighted graphs. Our algorithm improves the classical dynamic programming
approach by Dreyfus and Wagner. We achieve a significantly better practical
performance via pruning and future costs, a generalization of a well-known
concept to speed up shortest path computations. Our algorithm matches the best
known worst-case run time and has a fast, often superior, practical
performance: on some large instances originating from VLSI design, previous
best run times are improved upon by orders of magnitudes. We are also able to
solve larger instances of the $d$-dimensional rectilinear Steiner tree problem
for $d \in \{3, 4, 5\}$, whose Hanan grids contain up to several millions of
edges.
