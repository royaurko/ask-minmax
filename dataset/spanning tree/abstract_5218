This review describes the production of atomic strontium samples at ultra-low
temperature and at high phase-space density, and their possible use for
physical studies and applications. We describe the process of loading a
magneto-optical trap from an atomic beam and preparing the sample for high
precision measurements. Particular emphasis is given to the applications of
ultracold Sr samples, spanning from optical frequency metrology to force
sensing at micrometer scale.
