The cross-correlation search has been previously applied to map the
gravitational wave (GW) stochastic background in the sky and also to target GW
from rotating neutron stars/pulsars. Here we investigate how the
cross-correlation method can be used to target a small region in the sky
spanning at most a few pixels, where a pixel in the sky is determined by the
diffraction limit which depends on the (i) baseline joining a pair of detectors
and (ii) detector bandwidth. Here as one of the promising targets, we consider
the Virgo cluster - a "hot spot" spanning few pixels - which could contain, as
estimates suggest $\sim 10^{11}$ neutron stars, of which a small fraction would
continuously emit GW in the bandwidth of the detectors. For the detector
baselines, we consider advanced detector pairs among LCGT, LIGO, Virgo, ET etc.
Our results show that sufficient signal to noise can be accumulated with
integration times of the order of a year. The results improve for the
multibaseline search. This analysis could as well be applied to other likely
hot spots in the sky and other possible pairs of detectors.
