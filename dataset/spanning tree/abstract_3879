This paper provides an individual-based foundation for the logistic and
Lotka-Volterra equations which describe the diffusion of an innovation or the
competition between old and new alternatives, then presents two extensions of
this basic model. First, it extends the short-term competition to a long-term
process characterized by a sequence of innovations and substitutions. Next, by
allowing the substitutions to be incomplete, it extends the unidimensional
process to a tree-form multidimensional one featuring diversification
throughout the long-term development.
