We solve the problem of designing an O(1) time algorithm for generating
adjacent multiset combinations in a different approach from Walsh. By the word
adjacent, we mean that two adjacent multiset combinations are different at two
places by one in their vector forms. Previous O(1) time algorithms for multiset
combinations generated non-adjacent multiset combinations. Our algorithm in
this paper can be derived from a general framework of combinatorial Gray code,
which we characterise to suit our need for combinations and multiset
combinations. The central idea is a twisted lexico tree, which is obtained from
the lexicographic tree for the given set of combinatorial objects by twisting
branches depending on the parity of each node. An iterative algorithm which
traverses this tree will generate the given set of combinatorial objects in
constant time as well as with a fixed number of changes from the present
combinatorial object to the next.
