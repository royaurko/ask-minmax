For operators with homogeneous disorder, it is generally expected that there
is a relation between the spectral characteristics of a random operator in the
infinite setup and the distribution of the energy gaps in its finite volume
versions, in corresponding energy ranges. Whereas pure point spectrum of the
infinite operator goes along with Poisson level statistics, it is expected that
purely absolutely continuous spectrum would be associated with gap
distributions resembling the corresponding random matrix ensemble. We prove
that on regular rooted trees, which exhibit both spectral types, the eigenstate
point process has always Poissonian limit. However, we also find that this does
not contradict the picture described above if that is carefully interpreted, as
the relevant limit of finite trees is not the infinite homogenous tree graph
but rather a single-ended ``canopy graph''. For this tree graph, the random
Schroedinger operator is proven here to have only pure-point spectrum at any
strength of the disorder. For more general single-ended trees it is shown that
the spectrum is always singular -- pure point possibly with singular continuous
component which is proven to occur in some cases.
