This is an extended abstract of the talk given at the Oberwolfach Workshop
"Algebraic Structures in Low-Dimensional Topology", 25 May -- 31 May 2014. My
goal was to describe progress in distributive homology from the previous
Oberwolfach Workshop June 3 - June 9, 2012, in particular my work on
Yang-Baxter homology; however I concentrated my talk on my recent discovery of
q-polynomial of a rooted tree; the appropriate topic as my talk was on May 30,
2014, the 30 anniversary of the Jones polynomial, and the polynomial has its
roots in the Kauffman bracket approach to the Jones polynomial.
