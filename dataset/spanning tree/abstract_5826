We formulate the BES/FRS equation as a functional equation in the rapidity
space and perform its strong coupling expansion in the limit when $\ell=j/4g$
is kept finite. We obtain a result which is consistent with the previous
calculations at tree level and one loop and which differs from the two-loop
calculation in 0805.4615 by a term singular at $\ell=0$.
