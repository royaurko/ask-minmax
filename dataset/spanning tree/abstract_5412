We characterize a new mid-infrared frequency comb generator based on
difference frequency generation around 3.2 microns. High power per comb mode
(>10-7 W/mode) is obtained over a broad spectral span (>700 nm). The source is
used for direct absorption spectroscopy with a Michelson-based Fourier
transform interferometer.
