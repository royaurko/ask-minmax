Rotation distance between trees measures the number of simple operations it
takes to transform one tree into another. There are no known polynomial-time
algorithms for computing rotation distance. In the case of ordered rooted
trees, we show that the rotation distance between two ordered trees is
fixed-parameter tractable, in the parameter, k, the rotation distance. The
proof relies on the kernalization of the initial trees to trees with size
bounded by 7k.
