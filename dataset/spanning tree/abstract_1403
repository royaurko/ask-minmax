We introduce two metric spaces on ultrametric phylogenetic trees and compare
them with existing models of tree space. We formulate several formal
requirements that a metric space on phylogenetic trees must possess in order to
be a satisfactory space for statistical analysis, and justify them. We show
that only a few known constructions of the space of phylogenetic trees satisfy
these requirements. However, our results suggest that these basic requirements
are not enough to distinguish between the two metric spaces we introduce and
that the choice between metric spaces requires additional properties to be
considered.
