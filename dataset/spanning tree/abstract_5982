We present several enumeration results holding in sets of words called
neutral and which satisfy restrictive conditions on the set of possible
extensions of nonempty words. These formulae concern return words and bifix
codes. They generalize formulae previously known for Sturmian sets or more
generally for tree sets. We also give a geometric example of this class of
sets, namely the natural coding of some interval exchange transformations.
