We prove the following version of the Loebl-Komlos-Sos Conjecture: For every
alpha>0 there exists a number M such that for every k>M every n-vertex graph G
with at least (0.5+alpha)n vertices of degree at least (1+alpha)k contains each
tree T of order k as a subgraph.
  The method to prove our result follows a strategy common to approaches which
employ the Szemeredi Regularity Lemma: we decompose the graph G, find a
suitable combinatorial structure inside the decomposition, and then embed the
tree T into G using this structure. However, the decomposition given by the
Regularity Lemma is not of help when G is sparse. To surmount this shortcoming
we use a more general decomposition technique: each graph can be decomposed
into vertices of huge degree, regular pairs (in the sense of the Regularity
Lemma), and two other objects each exhibiting certain expansion properties.
