We consider the model of random trees introduced by Devroye [SIAM J. Comput.
28 (1999) 409-432]. The model encompasses many important randomized algorithms
and data structures. The pieces of data (items) are stored in a randomized
fashion in the nodes of a tree. The total path length (sum of depths of the
items) is a natural measure of the efficiency of the algorithm/data structure.
Using renewal theory, we prove convergence in distribution of the total path
length toward a distribution characterized uniquely by a fixed point equation.
Our result covers, using a unified approach, many data structures such as
binary search trees, m-ary search trees, quad trees, median-of-(2k+1) trees,
and simplex trees.
