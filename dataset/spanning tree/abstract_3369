FLY is a parallel treecode which makes heavy use of the one-sided
communication paradigm to handle the management of the tree structure. In its
public version the code implements the equations for cosmological evolution,
and can be run for different cosmological models.
  This reference guide describes the actual implementation of the algorithms of
the public version of FLY, and suggests how to modify them to implement other
types of equations (for instance the Newtonian ones)
