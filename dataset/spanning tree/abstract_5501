Diversities have recently been developed as multiway metrics admitting clear
and useful notions of hyperconvexity and tight span. In this note we consider
the analytic properties of diversities, in particular the generalizations of
uniform continuity, uniform convergence, Cauchy sequences and completeness to
diversities. We develop conformities, a diversity analogue of uniform spaces,
which abstract these concepts in the metric case. We show that much of the
theory of uniform spaces admits a natural analogue in this new structure; for
example, conformities can be defined either axiomatically or in terms of
uniformly continuous pseudodiversities.
  Just as diversities can be restricted to metrics, conformities can be
restricted to uniformities. We find that these two notions of restriction,
which are functors in the appropriate categories, are related by a natural
transformation.
