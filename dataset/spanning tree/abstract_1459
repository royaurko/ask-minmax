The search for similarity and dissimilarity measures on phylogenetic trees
has been motivated by the computation of consensus trees, the search by
similarity in phylogenetic databases, and the assessment of clustering results
in bioinformatics. The transposition distance for fully resolved phylogenetic
trees is a recent addition to the extensive collection of available metrics for
comparing phylogenetic trees. In this paper, we generalize the transposition
distance from fully resolved to arbitrary phylogenetic trees, through a
construction that involves an embedding of the set of phylogenetic trees with a
fixed number of labeled leaves into a symmetric group and a generalization of
Reidys-Stadler's involution metric for RNA contact structures. We also present
simple linear-time algorithms for computing it.
