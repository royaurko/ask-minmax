We revisit the classical approach to cluster expansions, based on tree
graphs, and establish a new convergence condition that improves those by
Kotecky-Preiss and Dobrushin, as we show in some examples. The two ingredients
of our approach are: (i) a careful consideration of the Penrose identity for
truncated functions, and (ii) the use of iterated transformations to bound
tree-graph expansions.
