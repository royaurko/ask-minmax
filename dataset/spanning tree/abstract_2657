We reconsider the valuation of barrier options by means of binomial trees
from a "forward looking" prospective rather than the more conventional
"backward induction" one used by standard approaches. This reformulation allows
us to write closed-form expressions for the value of European and American put
barrier-options on a non-dividend-paying stock.
