Let $m_t(\alpha)$ denote the $t$-metric Mahler measure of the algebraic
number $\alpha$. Recent work of the first contributor established that the infimum
in $m_t(\alpha)$ is attained by a single point $\bar\alpha =
(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_N)\in \overline{\mathbb Q}^N$ for all sufficiently
large $t$. Nevertheless, no efficient method for locating $\bar \alpha$ is
known. In this article, we define a new tree data structure, called a
factorization tree, which enables us to find $\bar\alpha$ when $\alpha\in
\mathbb Q$. We establish several basic properties of factorization trees, and
use these properties to locate $\bar\alpha$ in previously unknown cases.
