We describe the spectral theory of the adjacency operator of a graph which is
isomorphic to homogeneous trees at infinity. Using some combinatorics, we
reduce the problem to a scattering problem for a finite rank perturbation of
the adjacency operator on an homogeneous tree. We developp this scattering
theory using the classical recipes for Schr\"odinger operators in Euclidian
spaces.
