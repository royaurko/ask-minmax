This paper is a computation of the homotopy type of K, the space of long
knots in R^3, the same space of knots studied by Vassiliev via singularity
theory. Each component of K corresponds to an isotopy class of long knot, and
we `enumerate' the components via the companionship trees associated to the
knot. The knots with the simplest companionship trees are: the unknot, torus
knots, and hyperbolic knots. The homotopy-type of these components of K were
computed by Hatcher. In the case the companionship tree has height, we give a
fibre-bundle description of those components of K, recursively, in terms of the
homotopy types of `simpler' components of K, in the sense that they correspond
to knots with shorter companionship trees. The primary case studied in this
paper is the case of a knot which has a hyperbolic manifold contained in the
JSJ-decomposition of its complement.
