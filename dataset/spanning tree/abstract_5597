In this paper we will explore different available methodologies to
automatically design controllers for tasks that spans many level of
abstraction, where the gap between primitive behaviours and the task definition
is high. A good understanding of your evolutionary setup is needed to choose
the correct strategy with which to tackle complex tasks thus we'll first review
the most used types of each element composing an evolutionary setup
(controllers, objective functions, ect.) then we'll move the focus on the
bootstrapping problem and on the different strategies used to overcome it.
