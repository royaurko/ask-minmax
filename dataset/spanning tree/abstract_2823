Aim of this article is the construction of a spanning set for the space of
super cusp forms on a complex bounded symmetric super domain B of rank 1 with
respect to a lattice. The main ingredients are a generalization of the Anosov
closing lemma for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms and an unbounded
realization of B, in particular Fourier decomposition at the cusps mapped to
infinity via a partial Cayley transformation. The elements of the spanning set
are in finite-to-one correspondence with closed geodesics, the number of
elements corresponding to a geodesic growing linearly with its length.
