We comment on old and new results related to the destruction of a random
recursive tree (RRT), in which its edges are cut one after the other in a
uniform random order. In particular, we study the number of steps needed to
isolate or disconnect certain distinguished vertices when the size of the tree
tends to infinity. New probabilistic explanations are given in terms of the
so-called cut-tree and the tree of component sizes, which both encode different
aspects of the destruction process. Finally, we establish the connection to
Bernoulli bond percolation on large RRT's and present recent results on the
cluster sizes in the supercritical regime.
