We consider a variant of the radial spanning tree introduced by Baccelli and
Bordenave. Like the original model, our model is a tree rooted at the origin,
built on the realization of a planar Poisson point process. Unlike it, the
paths of our model have independent jumps. We show that locally our diffusively
rescaled tree, seen as the collection of the paths connecting its sites to the
root, converges in distribution to the Brownian Bridge Web, which is roughly
speaking a collection of coalescing Brownian bridges starting from all the
points of a planar strip perpendicular to the time axis, and ending at the
origin.
