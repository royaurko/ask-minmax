Let $M_d$ be the moduli space of one-dimensional complex polynomial dynamical
systems. The escape rates of the critical points determine a critical heights
map $G: M_d \to \mathbb{R}^{d-1}$. For generic values of $G$, each connected
component of a fiber of $G$ is the deformation space for twist deformations on
the basin of infinity. We analyze the quotient space $\mathcal{T}_d^*$ obtained
by collapsing each connected component of a fiber of $G$ to a point. The space
$\mathcal{T}_d^*$ is a parameter-space analog of the polynomial tree $T(f)$
associated to a polynomial $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$, studied by DeMarco and
McMullen, and there is a natural projection from $\mathcal{T}_d^*$ to the space
of trees $\mathcal{T}_d$. We show that the projectivization
$\mathbb{P}\mathcal{T}_d^*$ is compact and contractible; further, the shift
locus in $\mathbb{P}\mathcal{T}_d^*$ has a canonical locally finite simplicial
structure. The top-dimensional simplices are in one-to-one corespondence with
topological conjugacy classes of structurally stable polynomials in the shift
locus.
