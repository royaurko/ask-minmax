Exact analytic expression is derived for the matrix elements of the Coulomb
interaction in two dimensions in the form of a closed finite sum expression.
The orthonormal complete set of eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator is
used as the basis for spanning real space. Several recurrence relations have
been found in order to simplify the task of calculating the usually vast amount
of elements required for any computer simulation.
