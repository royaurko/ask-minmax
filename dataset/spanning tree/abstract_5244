A 29 W CW supercontinuum spanning from 1.06 to 1.67 um is generated in a
short length of PCF with two zero dispersion wavelengths. The continuum has the
highest spectral power density, greater than 50 mW/nm up to 1.4 um, reported to
date. The use of a short length of PCF enables the continuum to expand beyond
the water loss at 1.4 um. The dynamics of the continuum evolution are studied
experimentally and numerically with close attention given to the effects of the
water loss and the second zero dispersion wavelength.
