We prove two generalizations of the matrix-tree theorem. The first one, a
result essentially due to Moon for which we provide a new proof, extends the
``all minors'' matrix-tree theorem to the ``massive'' case where no condition
on row or column sums is imposed. The second generalization, which is new,
extends the recently discovered Pfaffian-tree theorem of Masbaum and Vaintrob
into a ``Hyperpfaffian-cactus'' theorem. Our methods are noninductive, explicit
and make critical use of Grassmann-Berezin calculus that was developed for the
needs of modern theoretical physics.
