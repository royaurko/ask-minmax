The analysis of objects living on ultrametric trees, in particular the
block-diagonalization of 4-replica matrices $M^{\alpha \beta ; \gamma
\delta}$, is shown to be dramatically simplified through the introduction of
properly chosen operations on those objects. These are the Replica Fourier
Transforms on ultrametric trees. Those transformations are defined and used in
the present work.
