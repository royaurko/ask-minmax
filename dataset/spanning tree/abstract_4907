REBOUND is a new multi-purpose N-body code which is freely available under an
open-source license. It was designed for collisional dynamics such as planetary
rings but can also solve the classical N-body problem. It is highly modular and
can be customized easily to work on a wide variety of different problems in
astrophysics and beyond.
  REBOUND comes with three symplectic integrators: leap-frog, the symplectic
epicycle integrator (SEI) and a Wisdom-Holman mapping (WH). It supports open,
periodic and shearing-sheet boundary conditions. REBOUND can use a Barnes-Hut
tree to calculate both self-gravity and collisions. These modules are fully
parallelized with MPI as well as OpenMP. The former makes use of a static
domain decomposition and a distributed essential tree. Two new collision
detection modules based on a plane-sweep algorithm are also implemented. The
performance of the plane-sweep algorithm is superior to a tree code for
simulations in which one dimension is much longer than the other two and in
simulations which are quasi-two dimensional with less than one million
particles.
  In this work, we discuss the different algorithms implemented in REBOUND, the
philosophy behind the code's structure as well as implementation specific
details of the different modules. We present results of accuracy and scaling
tests which show that the code can run efficiently on both desktop machines and
large computing clusters.
