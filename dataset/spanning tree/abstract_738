In this paper we study threshold coloring of graphs, where the vertex colors
represented by integers are used to describe any spanning subgraph of the given
graph as follows. Pairs of vertices with near colors imply the edge between
them is present and pairs of vertices with far colors imply the edge is absent.
Not all planar graphs are threshold-colorable, but several subclasses, such as
trees, some planar grids, and planar graphs without short cycles can always be
threshold-colored. Using these results we obtain unit-cube contact
representation of several subclasses of planar graphs. Variants of the
threshold coloring problem are related to well-known graph coloring and other
graph-theoretic problems. Using these relations we show the NP-completeness for
two of these variants, and describe a polynomial-time algorithm for another.
