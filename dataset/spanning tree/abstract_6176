Research on information extraction from Web pages (wrapping) has seen much
activity recently (particularly systems implementations), but little work has
been done on formally studying the expressiveness of the formalisms proposed or
on the theoretical foundations of wrapping. In this paper, we first study
monadic datalog over trees as a wrapping language. We show that this simple
language is equivalent to monadic second order logic (MSO) in its ability to
specify wrappers. We believe that MSO has the right expressiveness required for
Web information extraction and propose MSO as a yardstick for evaluating and
comparing wrappers. Along the way, several other results on the complexity of
query evaluation and query containment for monadic datalog over trees are
established, and a simple normal form for this language is presented. Using the
above results, we subsequently study the kernel fragment Elog$^-$ of the Elog
wrapping language used in the Lixto system (a visual wrapper generator).
Curiously, Elog$^-$ exactly captures MSO, yet is easier to use. Indeed,
programs in this language can be entirely visually specified.
