This paper studies the synchronization problem of second-order nonlinear
multi-agent systems with intermittent communication in the presence of
irregular communication delays and possible information loss. The control
objective is to steer all systems' positions to a common position with a
prescribed desired velocity available to only some leaders. Based on the
small-gain framework, we propose a synchronization scheme relying on an
intermittent information exchange protocol in the presence of time delays and
possible packet dropout. We show that our control objectives are achieved with
a simple selection of the control gains provided that the directed graph,
describing the interconnection between all systems (or agents), contains a
spanning tree. The example of Euler-Lagrange systems is considered to
illustrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
