The fluid-filled semicircular canals (SCCs) of the vestibular system are used
by all vertebrates to sense angular rotation. Despite masses spanning seven
decades, all mammalian SCCs are nearly the same size. We propose that the SCC
represents a sensory organ that evolution has `optimally designed'. Four
geometric parameters are used to characterize the SCC, and `building materials'
of given physical properties are assumed. Identifying physical and
physiological constraints on SCC operation, we find that the most sensitive SCC
has dimensions consistent with available data.
