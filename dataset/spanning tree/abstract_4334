We consider the task of controlling in a distributed way a Zielonka
asynchronous automaton. Every process of a controller has access to its causal
past to determine the next set of actions it proposes to play. An action can be
played only if every process controlling this action proposes to play it. We
consider reachability objectives: every process should reach its set of final
states. We show that this control problem is decidable for tree architectures,
where every process can communicate with its parent, its children, and with the
environment. The complexity of our algorithm is l-fold exponential with l being
the height of the tree representing the architecture. We show that this is
unavoidable by showing that even for three processes the problem is
EXPTIME-complete, and that it is non-elementary in general.
