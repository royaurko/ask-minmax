We derive sharp lower bounds for the first and the second Zagreb indices
($M_1$ and $M_2$ respectively) for trees and chemical trees with the given
number of pendent vertices and find optimal trees. $M_1$ is minimized by a tree
with all internal vertices having degree 4, while $M_2$ is minimized by a tree
where each "stem" vertex is incident to 3 or 4 pendent vertices and one
internal vertex, while the rest internal vertices are incident to 3 other
internal vertices. The technique is shown to generalize to the weighted first
Zagreb index, the zeroth order general Randi\'{c} index, as long as to many
other degree-based indices.
  Later the erratum was added: Theorem 3 says that the second Zagreb index
$M_2$ cannot be less than $11n-27$ for a tree with $n\ge 8$ pendent vertices.
Yet the tree exists with $n=8$ vertices (the two-sided broom) violating this
inequality. The reason is that the proof of Theorem 3 relays on a tacit
assumption that an index-minimizing tree contains no vertices of degree 2. This
assumption appears to be invalid in general. In this erratum we show that the
inequality $M_2 \ge 11n-27$ still holds for trees with $n\ge 9$ vertices and
provide the valid proof of the (corrected) Theorem 3.
