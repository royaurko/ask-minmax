Following the spirit of S-matrix program, we proposed a modified
Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten recursion relation for tree amplitudes of
noncommutative U(N) Yang-Mills theory. Starting from three-point amplitudes,
one can use this modified BCFW recursion relation to compute or analyze
color-ordered tree amplitudes without relying on any detail information of
noncommutative Yang-Mills theory. After clarifying the color structure of
noncommutative tree amplitudes, we wrote down the noncommutative analogies of
U(1)-decoupling, Kleiss-Kuijf and Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations for
color-ordered tree amplitudes, and proved them using the modified BCFW
recursion relation.
