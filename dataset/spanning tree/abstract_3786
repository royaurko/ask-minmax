We propose a new integral formula for all tree-level scattering amplitudes of
N=6 supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory. It resembles the
Roiban-Spradlin-Volovich-Witten formula for N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory based on a twistor string theory formulation. Our formula implies that
the (2k)-point tree-level amplitude is closely related to degree (k-1) curves
in CP^{k-1}.
