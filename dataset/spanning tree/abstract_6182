Multicast communication primitives have broad utility as building blocks for
distributed applications. The challenge is to create and maintain the
distributed structures that support these primitives while accounting for
volatile end nodes and variable network characteristics. Most solutions
proposed to date rely on complex algorithms or global information, thus
limiting the scale of deployments and acceptance outside the academic realm.
This article introduces a low-complexity, self organizing solution for
maintaining multicast trees, that we refer to as UMM (Unstructured Multi-source
Multicast). UMM uses traditional distributed systems techniques: layering,
soft-state, and passive data collection to adapt to the dynamics of the
physical network and maintain data dissemination trees. The result is a simple,
adaptive system with lower overheads than more complex alternatives. We have
implemented UMM and evaluated it on a 100-node PlanetLab testbed and on up to
1024-node emulated ModelNet networks Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate UMM's low overhead, efficient network usage compared to alternative
solutions, and ability to quickly adapt to network changes and to recover from
failures.
