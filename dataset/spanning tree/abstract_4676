Cyclic codes, as linear block error-correcting codes in coding theory, play a
vital role and have wide applications. Ding in \cite{D} constructed a number of
classes of cyclic codes from almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions and
planar functions over finite fields and presented ten open problems on cyclic
codes from highly nonlinear functions. In this paper, we consider two open
problems involving the inverse APN functions $f(x)=x^{q^m-2}$ and the Dobbertin
APN function $f(x)=x^{2^{4i}+2^{3i}+2^{2i}+2^{i}-1}$. From the calculation of
linear spans and the minimal polynomials of two sequences generated by these
two classes of APN functions, the dimensions of the corresponding cyclic codes
are determined and lower bounds on the minimum weight of these cyclic codes are
presented. Actually, we present a framework for the minimal polynomial and
linear span of the sequence $s^{\infty}$ defined by $s_t=Tr((1+\alpha^t)^e)$,
where $\alpha$ is a primitive element in $GF(q)$. These techniques can also be
applied into other open problems in \cite{D}.
