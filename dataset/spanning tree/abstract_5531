Experiments in a modified Taylor-Couette device, spanning Reynolds numbers of
$10^5$ to greater than $10^6$, reveal the nonlinear stability of
astrophysically-relevant flows. Nearly ideal rotation, expected in the absence
of axial boundaries, is achieved for a narrow range of operating parameters.
Departures from the optimal control space identify centrifugal instability of
boundary layers as the primary source of turbulence likely observed in former
experiments. By driving turbulence from a series of jets we demonstrate the
robustly quiescent nature of quasi-Keplerian flows, indicating that sustained
turbulence does not exist.
