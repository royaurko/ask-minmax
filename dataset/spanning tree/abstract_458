In this paper, we continue the study of neighborhood total domination in
graphs first studied by Arumugam and Sivagnanam [Opuscula Math. 31 (2011),
519--531]. A neighborhood total dominating set, abbreviated NTD-set, in a graph
$G$ is a dominating set $S$ in $G$ with the property that the subgraph induced
by the open neighborhood of the set $S$ has no isolated vertex. The
neighborhood total domination number, denoted by $\gnt(G)$, is the minimum
cardinality of a NTD-set of $G$. Every total dominating set is a NTD-set,
implying that $\gamma(G) \le \gnt(G) \le \gt(G)$, where $\gamma(G)$ and
$\gt(G)$ denote the domination and total domination numbers of $G$,
respectively. Arumugam and Sivagnanam posed the problem of characterizing the
connected graphs $G$ of order $n \ge 3$ achieving the largest possible
neighborhood total domination number, namely $\gnt(G) = \lceil n/2 \rceil$. A
partial solution to this problem was presented by Henning and Rad [Discrete
Applied Mathematics 161 (2013), 2460--2466] who showed that $5$-cycles and
subdivided stars are the only such graphs achieving equality in the bound when
$n$ is odd. In this paper, we characterize the extremal trees achieving
equality in the bound when $n$ is even. As a consequence of this tree
characterization, a characterization of the connected graphs achieving equality
in the bound when $n$ is even can be obtained noting that every spanning tree
of such a graph belongs to our family of extremal trees.
