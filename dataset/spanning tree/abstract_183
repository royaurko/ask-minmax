Let x and y be points chosen uniformly at random from $\Z_n^4$, the
four-dimensional discrete torus with side length n. We show that the length of
the loop-erased random walk from x to y is of order $n^2 (\log n)^{1/6}$,
resolving a conjecture of Benjamini and Kozma. We also show that the scaling
limit of the uniform spanning tree on $\Z_n^4$ is the Brownian continuum random
tree of Aldous. Our proofs use the techniques developed by Peres and Revelle,
who studied the scaling limits of the uniform spanning tree on a large class of
finite graphs that includes the d-dimensional discrete torus for $d \geq 5$, in
combination with results of Lawler concerning intersections of four-dimensional
random walks.
