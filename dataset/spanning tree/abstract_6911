This paper summarizes the work on implementing few solutions for the Steiner
Tree problem which we undertook in the PAAL project. The main focus of the
project is the development of generic implementations of approximation
algorithms together with universal solution frameworks. In particular, we have
implemented Zelikovsky 11/6-approximation using local search framework, and
1.39-approximation by Byrka et al. using iterative rounding framework. These
two algorithms are experimentally compared with greedy 2-approximation, with
exact but exponential time Dreyfus-Wagner algorithm, as well as with results
given by a state-of-the-art local search techniques by Uchoa and Werneck. The
results of this paper are twofold. On one hand, we demonstrate that high level
algorithmic concepts can be designed and efficiently used in C++. On the other
hand, we show that the above algorithms with good theoretical guarantees, give
decent results in practice, but are inferior to state-of-the-art heuristical
approaches.
