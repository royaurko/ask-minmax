Given a set $S$ of points in the plane, a geometric network for $S$ is a
graph $G$ with vertex set $S$ and straight edges. We consider a broadcasting
situation, where one point $r \in S$ is a designated source. Given a dilation
factor $\delta$, we ask for a geometric network $G$ such that for every point
$v \in S$ there is a path from $r$ to $v$ in $G$ of length at most
$\delta|rv|$, and such that the total edge length is minimized. We show that
finding such a network of minimum total edge length is NP-hard, and give an
approximation algorithm.
