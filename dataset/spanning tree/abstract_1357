While the notion of arboricity of a graph is well-known in graph theory, very
few results are dedicated to the minimal number of trees covering the edges of
a graph, called the tree number of a graph. In this paper we propose a method
for computing in polynomial time the tree number of a subclass of planar
graphs. The subclass in question includes but is not limited to outerplanar
graphs; the difference between arboricity and tree number for graphs in this
class can be arbitrarily big.
