The tree-metric theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a
dissimilarity matrix to be a tree metric, and has served as the foundation for
numerous distance-based reconstruction methods in phylogenetics. Our main
result is an extension of the tree-metric theorem to more general dissimilarity
maps. In particular, we show that a tree with n leaves is reconstructible from
the weights of the m-leaf subtrees provided that n \geq 2m-1.
