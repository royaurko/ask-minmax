A team of $r$ {\it revolutionaries} and a team of $s$ {\it spies} play a game
on a graph $G$. Initially, revolutionaries and then spies take positions at
vertices. In each subsequent round, each revolutionary may move to an adjacent
vertex or not move, and then each spy has the same option. The revolutionaries
want to hold an {\it unguarded meeting}, meaning $m$ revolutionaries at some
vertex having no spy at the end of a round. To prevent this forever, trivially
at least $\min\{|V(G)|,\FL{r/m}\}$ spies are needed. When $G$ is a tree, this
many spies suffices. When $G$ is a unicyclic graph, $\min\{|V(G)|,\CL{r/m}\}$
spies suffice, and we characterize those unicyclic graphs where $\FL{r/m}+1$
spies are needed. \def\FL#1{\lfloor #1 \rfloor} \def\CL#1{\lceil #1 \rceil}
