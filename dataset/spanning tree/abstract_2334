The definition of $n$-width of a bounded subset $A$ in a normed linear space
$X$ is based on the existence of $n$-dimensional subspaces. Although the
concept of an $n$-dimensional subspace is not available for metric trees, in
this paper, using the properties of convex and compact subsets, we present a
notion of $n$-widths for a metric tree, called T$n$-widths. Later we discuss
properties of T$n$-widths, and show that the compact width is attained. A
relationship between the compact widths and T$n$-widths is also obtained.
