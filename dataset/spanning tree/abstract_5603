We study the expected number of real zeros for random linear combinations of
orthogonal polynomials. It is well known that Kac polynomials, spanned by
monomials with i.i.d. Gaussian coefficients, have only $(2/\pi + o(1))\log{n}$
expected real zeros in terms of the degree $n$. On the other hand, if the basis
is given by Legendre (or more generally by Jacobi) polynomials, then random
linear combinations have $n/\sqrt{3} + o(n)$ expected real zeros. We prove that
the latter asymptotic relation holds universally for a large class of random
orthogonal polynomials on the real line, and also give more general local
results on the expected number of real zeros.
