We study distorted metrics on binary trees in the context of phylogenetic
reconstruction. Given a binary tree $T$ on $n$ leaves with a path metric $d$,
consider the pairwise distances $\{d(u,v)\}$ between leaves. It is well known
that these determine the tree and the $d$ length of all edges. Here we consider
distortions $\d$ of $d$ such that for all leaves $u$ and $v$ it holds that
$|d(u,v) - \d(u,v)| < f/2$ if either $d(u,v) < M$ or $\d(u,v) < M$, where $d$
satisfies $f \leq d(e) \leq g$ for all edges $e$. Given such distortions we
show how to reconstruct in polynomial time a forest $T_1,...,T_{\alpha}$ such
that the true tree $T$ may be obtained from that forest by adding $\alpha-1$
edges and $\alpha-1 \leq 2^{-\Omega(M/g)} n$.
  Metric distortions arise naturally in phylogeny, where $d(u,v)$ is defined by
the log-det of a covariance matrix associated with $u$ and $v$. of a covariance
matrix associated with $u$ and $v$. When $u$ and $v$ are ``far'', the entries
of the covariance matrix are small and therefore $\d(u,v)$, which is defined by
log-det of an associated empirical-correlation matrix may be a bad estimate of
$d(u,v)$ even if the correlation matrix is ``close'' to the covariance matrix.
  Our metric results are used in order to show how to reconstruct phylogenetic
forests with small number of trees from sequences of length logarithmic in the
size of the tree. Our method also yields an independent proof that phylogenetic
trees can be reconstructed in polynomial time from sequences of polynomial
length under the standard assumptions in phylogeny. Both the metric result and
its applications to phylogeny are almost tight.
