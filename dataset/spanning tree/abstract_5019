We discuss the signatures of an evolving accretion disk around the nucleus of
NGC 1097, based on observations of its double-peaked H-alpha emission-line
profile which cover a time span of 10 yrs. The monitoring of the profile has
allowed us to better constrain the inner radius of the accretion disk, and to
propose a scenario in which the ionizing source is getting dimmer and making
the peak of the disk emissivity to drift inwards.
