We review the Majumdar-Dhar bijection between recurrent states of the Abelian
sandpile model and spanning trees. We generalize earlier results of Athreya and
Jarai on the infinite volume limit of the stationary distribution of the
sandpile model on Z^d, d >= 2, to a large class of graphs. This includes: (i)
graphs on which the wired spanning forest is connected and has one end; (ii)
transitive graphs with volume growth at least c n^5 on which all bounded
harmonic functions are constant. We also extend a result of Maes, Redig and
Saada on the stationary distribution of sandpiles on infinite regular trees, to
arbitrary exhaustions.
