The Pattern self-Assembly Tile set Synthesis (PATS) problem is to determine a
set of coloured tiles that self-assemble to implement a given rectangular
colour pattern. We give an exhaustive branch-and-bound algorithm to find tile
sets of minimum cardinality for the PATS problem. Our algorithm makes use of a
search tree in the lattice of partitions of the ambient rectangular grid, and
an efficient bounding function to prune this search tree. Empirical data on the
performance of the algorithm shows that it compares favourably to previously
presented heuristic solutions to the problem.
