By using Symanzik's improvement program, we study on-shell improved lattice
QCD with staggered fermions. We find that there are as many as 15 independent
lattice operators of dimension of six~(including both gauge and fermion
operators) which must be added to the unimproved action to form an $O(a^2)$
improved action. Among them, the total number of dimension-6 gauge operators
and fermion bilinears is 5. The other 10 terms are four-fermion operators. At
the tree-level and tadpole-improved tree-level, all the 10 four fermion
operators are absent.
