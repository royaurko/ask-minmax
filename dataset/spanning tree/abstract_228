In this paper, we investigate the polynomial integrand of an integral formula
that yields the expected length of the minimal spanning tree of a graph whose
edges are uniformly distributed over the interval [0, 1]. In particular, we
derive a general formula for the coefficients of the polynomial and apply it to
express the first few coefficients in terms of the structure of the underlying
graph; e.g. number of vertices, edges and cycles.
