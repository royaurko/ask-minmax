In this talk, we briefly comment on Sweeny and Gliozzi methods, cluster Monte
Carlo method, and recent transition matrix Monte Carlo for Potts models. We
mostly concentrate on a new algorithm known as "binary tree summation". Some of
the most interesting features of this method will be highlighted - such as
simulating fractional number of Potts states, as well as offering the partition
function and thermodynamic quantities as functions of temperature in a single
run.
