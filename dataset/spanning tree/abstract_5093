This is the account of the workshop Exact solutions and their interpretation
at the 16-th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation
held in Durban, July 15-21, 2001. Work reported in 32 oral contributions
spanned a wide variety of topics, ranging from exact radiative spacetimes to
cosmological solutions. Two invited review talks, on the role of exact
solutions in string theory and in cosmology, are also described.
