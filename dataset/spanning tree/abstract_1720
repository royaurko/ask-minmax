The self-similar structure of the attracting subshift of a primitive
substitution is carried over to the limit set of the repelling tree in the
boundary of Outer Space of the corresponding irreducible outer automorphism of
a free group. Thus, this repelling tree is self-similar (in the sense of graph
directed constructions). Its Hausdorff dimension is computed. This reveals the
fractal nature of the attracting tree in the boundary of Outer Space of an
irreducible outer automorphism of a free group.
