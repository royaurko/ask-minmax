We use the twistor-string theory on the B-model of CP^{3|4} to compute the
maximally helicity violating(MHV) tree amplitudes for conformal supergravitons.
The correlator of a bilinear in the affine Kac-Moody current(Sugawara
stress-energy tensor) can generate these amplitudes. We compare with previous
results from open string version of twistor-string theory. We also compute the
MHV tree amplitudes for both gravitons and gluons from the correlators between
stress-energy tensor and current.
