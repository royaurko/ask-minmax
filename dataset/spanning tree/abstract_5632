Contrary to their capillary resonances (Rayleigh, 1879) and their optical
resonances (Ashkin, 1977), droplets acoustical resonances were rarely
considered. Here we experimentally excite, for the first time, the acoustical
resonances of a droplet that relies on sound instead of capillary waves.
Droplets vibrations at 37 MHz rates and 100 quality factor are optically
excited and interrogated at an optical threshold of 68 microWatt. Our
vibrations span a spectral band that is 1000 times higher when compared with
drops previously-studied capillary vibration.
