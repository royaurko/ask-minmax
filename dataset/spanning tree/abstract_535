We use the correlation matrix of stocks returns in order to create maps of
the S\~ao Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&F-Bovespa), Brazil's main stock exchange.
The data reffer to the year 2010, and the correlations between stock returns
lead to the construction of a minimum spanning tree and of asset graphs with a
variety of threshold values. The results are analised using techniques of
network theory.
