We calculate generating functions for the Poincare polynomials of moduli
spaces of pointed curves of genus zero and of Configuration Spaces of Fulton
and MacPherson. We also prove that contributions of multiple coverings of
curves in a Calabi-Yau threefold calculated via Kontsevich's compactification
coincide with the prediction of Candelas et al., and Aspinwall and Morrison.
