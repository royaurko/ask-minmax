A non-deterministic automaton running on infinite trees is unambiguous if it
has at most one accepting run on every tree. The class of languages
recognisable by unambiguous tree automata is still not well-understood. In
particular, decidability of the problem whether a given language is
recognisable by some unambiguous automaton is open. Moreover, there are no
known upper bounds on the descriptive complexity of unambiguous languages among
all regular tree languages.
  In this paper we show the following complexity collapse: if a
non-deterministic parity tree automaton $A$ is unambiguous and its priorities
are between $i$ and $2n$ then the language recognised by $A$ is in the class
$Comp(i+1,2n)$. A particular case of this theorem is for $i=n=1$: if $A$ is an
unambiguous Buchi tree automaton then $L(A)$ is recognisable by a weak
alternating automaton (or equivalently definable in weak MSO). The main
motivation for this result is a theorem by Finkel and Simonnet stating that
every unambiguous Buchi automaton recognises a Borel language.
  The assumptions of the presented theorem are syntactic (we require one
automaton to be both unambiguous and of particular parity index). However, to
the contributors' best knowledge this is the first theorem showing a collapse of the
parity index that exploits the fact that a given automaton is unambiguous.
