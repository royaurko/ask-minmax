Recently we developed supervisor localization, a top-down approach to
distributed control of discrete-event systems in the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory
control framework. Its essence is the decomposition of monolithic (global)
control action into local control strategies for the individual agents. In this
paper, we establish a counterpart supervisor localization theory in the
framework of State Tree Structures, known to be efficient for control design of
very large systems. In the new framework, we introduce the new concepts of
local state tracker, local control function, and state-based local-global
control equivalence. As before, we prove that the collective localized control
behavior is identical to the monolithic optimal (i.e. maximally permissive) and
nonblocking controlled behavior. In addition, we propose a new and more
efficient localization algorithm which exploits BDD computation. Finally we
demonstrate our localization approach on a model for a complex semiconductor
manufacturing system.
