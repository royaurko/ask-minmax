Context. The young active star BD +20 1790 is believed to host a substellar
companion, revealed by radial-velocity measurements that detected the reflex
motion induced on the parent star.
  Aims. A complete characterisation of the radial-velocity signal is necessary
in order to assess its nature.
  Methods. We used CORALIE spectrograph to obtain precise (~10 m/s) velocity
measurements on this active star, while characterizing the bisector span
variations. Particular attention was given to correctly sample both the
proposed planetary orbital period, of 7.8 days, and the stellar rotation
period, of 2.4 days.
  Results. A smaller radial-velocity signal (with peak-to-peak variations <500
m/s) than had been reported previously was detected, with different amplitude
on two different campaigns. A periodicity similar to the rotational period is
found on the data, as well as a clear correlation between radial-velocities and
bisector span. This evidence points towards a stellar origin of the
radial-velocity variations of the star instead of a barycentric movement of the
star, and repudiates the reported detection of a hot-Jupiter.
