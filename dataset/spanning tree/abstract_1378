We consider growing random recursive trees in random environment, in which at
each step a new vertex is attached (by an edge of a random length) to an
existing tree vertex according to a probability distribution that assigns the
tree vertices masses proportional to their random weights. The main aim of the
paper is to study the asymptotic behaviour of the distance from the newly
inserted vertex to the tree's root and that of the mean numbers of outgoing
vertices as the number of steps tends to infinity. Most of the results are
obtained under the assumption that the random weights have a product form with
independent identically distributed factors.
