In this technical note, cluster consensus of discrete-time linear multi-agent
systems is investigated. A set of stochastic matrices $\mathcal{P}$ is said to
be a cluster consensus set if the system achieves cluster consensus for any
initial state and any sequence of matrices taken from $\mathcal{P}$. By
introducing a cluster ergodicity coefficient, we present an equivalence
relation between a range of characterization of cluster consensus set under
some mild conditions including the widely adopted inter-cluster common
influence. We obtain a combinatorial necessary and sufficient condition for a
compact set $\mathcal{P}$ to be a cluster consensus set. This combinatorial
condition is an extension of the avoiding set condition for global consensus,
and can be easily checked by an elementary routine. As a byproduct, our result
unveils that the cluster-spanning trees condition is not only sufficient but
necessary in some sense for cluster consensus problems.
