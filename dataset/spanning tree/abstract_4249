The question of the relative size of tree and penguin amplitudes is analyzed
using the data on B to pi pi, B^+ to pi^+ K^0, and B^+ to K^+ \bar{K}^0 decays.
Our discussion involves an estimate of SU(3) breaking in the final
quark-pair-creating hadronization process. The estimate is based on Regge
phenomenology, which many years ago proved very successful in the description
of soft hadronic physics. Accepting the Regge prediction as solid, it is then
shown that the relative size and phase of the two parts of the penguin
amplitude can be unambiguously extracted from the data on the decays
considered. This enables fixing the C/T ratio of `true' tree amplitudes, which
- on the basis of the existing data - is shown to be small (of the order of
0.2).
