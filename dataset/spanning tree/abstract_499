We describe a synchronous distributed algorithm which identifies the
edge-biconnected components of a connected network. It requires a leader, and
uses messages of size O(log |V|). The main idea is to preorder a BFS spanning
tree, and then to efficiently compute least common ancestors so as to mark
cycle edges. This algorithm takes O(Diam) time and uses O(|E|) messages.
Furthermore, we show that no correct singly-initiated edge-biconnectivity
algorithm can beat either bound on any graph by more than a constant factor. We
also describe a near-optimal local algorithm for edge-biconnectivity.
