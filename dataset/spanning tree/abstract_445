If we are given $n$ random points in the hypercube $[0,1]^d$, then the
minimum length of a Traveling Salesperson Tour through the points, the minimum
length of a spanning tree, and the minimum length of a matching, etc., are
known to be asymptotically $\beta n^{\frac{d-1}{d}}$ a.s., where $\beta$ is an
absolute constant in each case. We prove separation results for these
constants. In particular, concerning the constants $\beta_{\mathrm{TSP}}^d$,
$\beta_{\mathrm{MST}}^d$, $\beta_{\mathrm{MM}}^d$, and $\beta_{\mathrm{TF}}^d$
from the asymptotic formulas for the minimum length TSP, spanning tree,
matching, and 2-factor, respectively, we prove that
$\beta_{\mathrm{MST}}^d<\beta_{\mathrm{TSP}}^d$,
$2\beta_{\mathrm{MM}}^d<\beta_{\mathrm{TSP}}^d$, and
$\beta_{\mathrm{TF}}^d<\beta_{\mathrm{TSP}}^d$ for all $d\geq 2$. We also
asymptotically separate the TSP from its linear programming relaxation in this
setting. Our results have some computational relevance, showing that a certain
natural class of simple algorithms cannot solve the random Euclidean TSP
efficiently.
