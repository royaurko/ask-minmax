We consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process on a ring, with an
arbitrary asymmetry between the hopping rates of the particles. Using a
functional formulation of the Bethe equations of the model, we derive exact
expressions for all the cumulants of the current in the stationary state. These
expressions involve tree structures with composite nodes. In the thermodynamic
limit, three regimes can be observed for the current fluctuations depending on
how the asymmetry scales with the size of the system.
