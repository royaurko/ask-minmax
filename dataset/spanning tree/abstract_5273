A linkage of order k of a graph G is a subgraph with k components, each of
which is a path. A linkage is vital if it spans all vertices, and no other
linkage connects the same pairs of end vertices. We give a characterization of
the graphs with a vital linkage of order 2: they are certain minors of a family
of highly structured graphs.
