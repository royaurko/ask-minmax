We consider a family of fragmentation processes where the rate at which a
particle splits is proportional to a function of its mass. Let
$F\_{1}^{(m)}(t),F\_{2}^{(m)}(t),...$ denote the decreasing rearrangement of
the masses present at time $t$ in a such process, starting from an initial mass
$m$. Let then $m\to \infty $. Under an assumption of regular variation type on
the dynamics of the fragmentation, we prove that the sequence
$(F\_{2}^{(m)},F\_{3}^{(m)},...)$ converges in distribution, with respect to
the Skorohod topology, to a fragmentation with immigration process. This holds
jointly with the convergence of $m-F\_{1}^{(m)}$ to a stable subordinator. A
continuum random tree counterpart of this result is also given: the continuum
random tree describing the genealogy of a self-similar fragmentation satisfying
the required assumption and starting from a mass converging to $\infty $ will
converge to a tree with a spine coding a fragmentation with immigration.
