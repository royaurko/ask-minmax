We consider random Schr\"odinger operators on tree graphs and prove
absolutely continuous spectrum at small disorder for two models. The first
model is the usual binary tree with certain strongly correlated random
potentials. These potentials are of interest since for complete correlation
they exhibit localization at all disorders. In the second model we change the
tree graph by adding all possible edges to the graph inside each sphere, with
weights proportional to the number of points in the sphere.
