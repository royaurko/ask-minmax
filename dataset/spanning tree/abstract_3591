We present here a new conjecture for the nature of the Mersenne prime numbers
by connecting it with the Collatz-Kakutani problem. By introducing a natural
path length on the basis of the Collatz-Kakutani tree, we conjecture that this
path length of a Mersenne prime from the root of the Collatz-Kakutani tree is
approximately proportional to the index of the Mersenne prime. We also discuss
difference of behaviors between Mersenne numbers and Mersenne primes.
