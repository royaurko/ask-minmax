A hierarchical model for the growth of planar arch structures for RNA
secondary structures is presented, and shown to be equivalent to a tree-growth
model. Both models can be solved analytically, giving access to scaling
functions for large molecules, and corrections to scaling, checked by numerical
simulations of up to 6500 bases. The equivalence of both models should be
helpful in understanding more general tree-growth processes.
