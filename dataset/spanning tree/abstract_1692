In a supercritical branching particle system, the trimmed tree consists of
those particles which have descendants at all times. We develop this concept in
the superprocess setting. For a class of continuous superprocesses with Feller
underlying motion on compact spaces, we identify the trimmed tree, which turns
out to be a binary splitting particle system with a new underlying motion that
is a compensated h-transform of the old one. We show how trimmed trees may be
estimated from above by embedded binary branching particle systems.
