An absolutely representing family of subspaces is a natural generalization of
an absolutely representing system of subspaces and absolutely representing
system (of elements). We obtain necessary an (or) sufficient conditions for a
family of subspaces to be an absolutely representing family of subspaces and
study properties of absolutely representing families of subspaces in Banach
spaces. As an example, we study families of subspaces spanned by exponents.
