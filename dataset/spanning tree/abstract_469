Self-stabilization is a versatile approach to fault-tolerance since it
permits a distributed system to recover from any transient fault that
arbitrarily corrupts the contents of all memories in the system. Byzantine
tolerance is an attractive feature of distributed systems that permits to cope
with arbitrary malicious behaviors. This paper focus on systems that are both
self-stabilizing and Byzantine tolerant. We consider the well known problem of
constructing a maximum metric tree in this context. Combining these two
properties is known to induce many impossibility results. In this paper, we
provide first two impossibility results about the construction of maximum
metric tree in presence of transients and (permanent) Byzantine faults. Then,
we provide a new self-stabilizing protocol that provides optimal containment of
an arbitrary number of Byzantine faults.
