In the analysis of structures under dynamic loads, selection of a proper time
step has a great influence to reach exact results. In this research
determination of proper time step in dynamic analysis of railway bridges under
high speed moving loads is considered. Dynamic responses of four simple span
steel bridges with 10, 15, 20 and 25 meter length to moving trains with speed
from 100 to 400 km/h and axle distances from 13 to 23 meter are calculated
considering different time steps in analysis. The results indicate that by
increase in moving speed of vehicle (increase in loading speed) the length of
proper time step for dynamic analysis is reduced. In contrast by increase in
span length (increase in bridge vibration period) longer time steps can be used
in dynamic analysis. In this research by investigation of dynamic analysis
results, an equation is suggested for determination of proper time step for
dynamic analysis of bridges under moving loads.
