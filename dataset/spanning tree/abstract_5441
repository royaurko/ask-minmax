In an artificial 3D percolation nano medium, the clusters filled by the Ising
magnets give rise to a topologically nontrivial magnetic structure, leading to
new features of the ferromagnetic phase transition without an external magnetic
field. In such an inhomogeneous system, the standard Ising model is strongly
modified by the spatial percolation cluster distribution. We found numerically
that at percolation occupation probability $p<1$ far from the percolation
threshold $p_{c3D}$, the magnetization shows ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase
transition with the transition temperature $T_{c}$ depending considerably on
the probability $p$. We provide numerical evidence that in vicinity $p_{c3D}$\
the dependence $T_{c}(p)$ is affected by the noninteger fractal dimension
$D_{H}(p)$ of the incipient percolation spanning cluster.
