We consider the problem of maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference in discrete
graphical models. We present a parallel MAP inference algorithm called
Bethe-ADMM based on two ideas: tree-decomposition of the graph and the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). However, unlike the
standard ADMM, we use an inexact ADMM augmented with a Bethe-divergence based
proximal function, which makes each subproblem in ADMM easy to solve in
parallel using the sum-product algorithm. We rigorously prove global
convergence of Bethe-ADMM. The proposed algorithm is extensively evaluated on
both synthetic and real datasets to illustrate its effectiveness. Further, the
parallel Bethe-ADMM is shown to scale almost linearly with increasing number of
cores.
