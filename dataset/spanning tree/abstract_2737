In this paper, we consider the linearly reinforced and the once-reinforced
random walk models in the transient phase on trees. We show the large
deviations for the upper tails for both models. We also show the exponential
decay for the lower tail in the once-reinforced random walk model. On the other
hand, the lower tail is in polynomial decay for the linearly reinforced random
walk model.
