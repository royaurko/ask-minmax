According to Ryu and Takayanagi, the entanglement entropy in conformal field
theory (CFT) is related through the AdS/CFT correspondence to the area of a
minimal surface in the bulk. We study this holographic geometrical method of
calculating the entanglement entropy in the vacuum case of a CFT which is
holographically dual to empty anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Namely, we
investigate the minimal surfaces spanned on boundaries of spherical domains at
infinity of hyperbolic space, which represents a time-slice of AdS spacetime.
We consider a generic position of two spherical domains: two disjoint domains,
overlapping domains, and touching domains. In all these cases we find the
explicit expressions for the minimal surfaces and the renormalized expression
for the area. We study also the embedding of the minimal surfaces into full AdS
spacetime and we find that for a proper choice of the static Killing vector we
can model a dynamical situation of "tearing" of the minimal surface when the
domains on which it is spanned are moved away from each other.
