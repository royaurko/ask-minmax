In this article we study the K- and L-theory of groups acting on trees. We
consider the problem in the context of the fibered isomorphism conjecture of
Farrell and Jones. We show that in the class of residually finite groups it is
enough to prove the conjecture for finitely presented groups with one end.
Also, we deduce that the conjecture is true for the fundamental groups of
graphs of finite groups and of trees of virtually cyclic groups. To motivate
the reader we include a survey on some classical works on this subject.
