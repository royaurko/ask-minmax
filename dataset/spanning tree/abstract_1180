A widely used method for determining the similarity of two labeled trees is
to compute a maximum agreement subtree of the two trees. Previous work on this
similarity measure is only concerned with the comparison of labeled trees of
two special kinds, namely, uniformly labeled trees (i.e., trees with all their
nodes labeled by the same symbol) and evolutionary trees (i.e., leaf-labeled
trees with distinct symbols for distinct leaves). This paper presents an
algorithm for comparing trees that are labeled in an arbitrary manner. In
addition to this generality, this algorithm is faster than the previous
algorithms.
  Another contribution of this paper is on maximum weight bipartite matchings.
We show how to speed up the best known matching algorithms when the input
graphs are node-unbalanced or weight-unbalanced. Based on these enhancements,
we obtain an efficient algorithm for a new matching problem called the
hierarchical bipartite matching problem, which is at the core of our maximum
agreement subtree algorithm.
