We show that that four dimensional conformal gravity plus a simple Neumann
boundary condition can be used to get the semiclassical (or tree level)
wavefunction of the universe of four dimensional asymptotically de-Sitter or
Euclidean anti-de Sitter spacetimes. This simple Neumann boundary condition
selects the Einstein solution out of the more numerous solutions of conformal
gravity. It thus removes the ghosts of conformal gravity from this computation.
  In the case of a five dimensional pure gravity theory with a positive
cosmological constant we show that the late time superhorizon tree level
probability measure, $|\Psi [ g ]|^2$, for its four dimensional spatial slices
is given by the action of Euclidean four dimensional conformal gravity.
