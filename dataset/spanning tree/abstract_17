A tree with at most $k$ leaves is called a $k$-ended tree. A spanning 2-ended
tree is a Hamilton path. A Hamilton cycle can be considered as a spanning
1-ended tree. The earliest result concerning spanning trees with few leaves
states that if $k$ is a positive integer and $G$ is a connected graph of order
$n$ with $d(x)+d(y)\ge n-k+1$ for each pair of nonadjacent vertices $x,y$, then
$G$ has a spanning $k$-ended tree. In this paper, we improve this result in two
ways, and an analogous result is proved for dominating $k$-ended trees based on
the generalized parameter $t_k$ - the order of a largest $k$-ended tree. In
particular, $t_1$ is the circumference (the length of a longest cycle), and
$t_2$ is the order of a longest path.
