Nath and Paul (Linear Algebra Appl.,460(2014),97-110) have shown that the
largest distance Laplacian eigenvalue of a path is simple and the corresponding
eigenvector has properties similar to the Fiedler vector. We given an
alternative proof, establishing a more general result in the process. It is
conjectured that a similar phenomenon holds for any tree.
