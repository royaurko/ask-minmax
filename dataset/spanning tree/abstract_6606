Let G be a group acting cocompactly without inversion on a tree X, with all
vertex and edge stabilizers isomorphic to the same free abelian group Z^n. We
prove that G has the Haagerup Property if and only if G is weakly amenable, and
we give a necessary and sufficient condition for this to happen. In particular,
denoting by d the rank of the fundamental group of the graph X modded out by G,
we deduce that G has the Haagerup Property if either d=0, d=1, or n=1. In these
three cases, we show that the L^p-compression rate of G is 1, and that its
equivariant L^p-compression rate is max{1/p,1/2} (provided G is non-amenable).
We also discuss quasi-isometric embeddings of G into a product of finitely many
regular trivalent trees.
