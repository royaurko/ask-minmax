The paper briefly describes a basic set of special combinatorial engineering
frameworks for solving complex problems in the field of hierarchical modular
systems. The frameworks consist of combinatorial problems (and corresponding
models), which are interconnected/linked (e.g., by preference relation).
Mainly, hierarchical morphological system model is used. The list of basic
standard combinatorial engineering (technological) frameworks is the following:
(1) design of system hierarchical model, (2) combinatorial synthesis
('bottom-up' process for system design), (3) system evaluation, (4) detection
of system bottlenecks, (5) system improvement (re-design, upgrade), (6)
multi-stage design (design of system trajectory), (7) combinatorial modeling of
system evolution/development and system forecasting. The combinatorial
engineering frameworks are targeted to maintenance of some system life cycle
stages. The list of main underlaying combinatorial optimization problems
involves the following: knapsack problem, multiple-choice problem, assignment
problem, spanning trees, morphological clique problem.
