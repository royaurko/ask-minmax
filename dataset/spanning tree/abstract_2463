We present several results that rely on arguments involving the combinatorics
of "bushy trees". These include the fact that there are arbitrarily
slow-growing diagonally noncomputable (DNC) functions that compute no Kurtz
random real, as well as an extension of a result of Kumabe in which we
establish that there are DNC functions relative to arbitrary oracles that are
of minimal Turing degree. Along the way, we survey some of the existing
instances of bushy tree arguments in the literature.
