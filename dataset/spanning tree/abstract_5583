We prove that products of at most two vector valued Eisenstein series that
originate in level 1 span all spaces of cusp forms for congruence subgroups.
This can be viewed as an analogue in the level aspect to a result by Kohnen and
Zagier, which focuses on the weight aspect. The main feature of the proof are
vector valued Hecke operators. We recover several classical constructions from
them, including classical Hecke operators, Atkin-Lehner involutions, and
oldforms. As a corollary to our main theorem, we obtain a vanishing condition
for modular forms reminiscent of period relations deduced by Kohnen and Zagier
in the context their previously mentioned result.
