We study protected nodes in various classes of random rooted trees by putting
them in the general context of fringe subtrees introduced by Aldous (1991).
Several types of random trees are considered: simply generated trees (or
conditioned Galton-Watson trees), which includes several cases treated
separately by other contributors, binary search trees and random recursive trees.
This gives unified and simple proofs of several earlier results, as well as new
results.
