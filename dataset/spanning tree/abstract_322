We study the classical dimer model on a square lattice with a single vacancy
by developing a graph-theoretic classification of the set of all configurations
which extends the spanning tree formulation of close-packed dimers. With this
formalism, we can address the question of the possible motion of the vacancy
induced by dimer slidings. We find a probability 57/4-10Sqrt[2] for the vacancy
to be strictly jammed in an infinite system. More generally, the size
distribution of the domain accessible to the vacancy is characterized by a
power law decay with exponent 9/8. On a finite system, the probability that a
vacancy in the bulk can reach the boundary falls off as a power law of the
system size with exponent 1/4. The resultant weak localization of vacancies
still allows for unbounded diffusion, characterized by a diffusion exponent
that we relate to that of diffusion on spanning trees. We also implement
numerical simulations of the model with both free and periodic boundary
conditions.
