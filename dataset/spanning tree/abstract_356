We lift the characteristic-2 totally twisted Khovanov homology of Roberts and
Jaeger to a theory with integer coefficients. The result is a complex computing
reduced odd Khovanov homology for knots. This complex is equivalent to a
spanning-tree complex whose differential is explicit modulo a sign ambiguity
coming from the need to choose a sign assignment in the definition of odd
Khovanov homology.
