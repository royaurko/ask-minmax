We introduce here the notion of Koszul duality for monoids in the monoidal
category of species with respect to the ordinary product. To each Koszul monoid
we associate a class of Koszul algebras in the sense of Priddy, by taking the
corresponding analytic functor. The operad $\mathscr{A}_M$ of rooted trees
enriched with a monoid $M$ was introduced by the contributor many years ago. One
special case of that is the operad of ordinary rooted trees, called in the
recent literature the permutative non associative operad. We prove here that
$\mathscr{A}_M$ is Koszul if and only if the corresponding monoid $M$ is
Koszul. In this way we obtain a wide family of Koszul operads, extending a
recent result of Chapoton and Livernet, and providing an interesting link
between Koszul duality for associative algebras and Koszul duality for operads.
