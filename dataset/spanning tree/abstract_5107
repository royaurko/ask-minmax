I study the scalar representations of the electroweak group of the Standard
Model, with a special emphasis on their chiral properties and on their
behaviour by the discrete symmetries P and CP. A gauge theory for J=0 mesons
naturally springs out, together with a new approach to the question of the
electroweak violation of CP. When acting in the 4-dimensional space of states
spanned by the special representations under scrutiny in this paper, the
electric charge appears as one of the three generators of the diagonal SU(2)
and its eigenvalues are consequently quantized.
