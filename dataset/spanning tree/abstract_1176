In this paper we consider the categorical Isbell completion construction for
generalized metric spaces in the sense of Lawvere. We show that this is an
analogue of the tight span construction of classical metric spaces, and that
the Isbell completion coincides with the directed tight span of Hirai and
Koichi. The notions of categorical completion and cocompletion are related to
the existence of semi-tropical module structure, and it is shown that the
Isbell completion (hence the directed tight span) has two different
semi-tropical module structures.
