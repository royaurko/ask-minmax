We prove that a uniform, rooted unordered binary tree with $n$ vertices has
the Brownian continuum random tree as its scaling limit for the
Gromov-Hausdorff topology. The limit is thus, up to a constant factor, the same
as that of uniform plane trees or labeled trees. Our analysis rests on a
combinatorial and probabilistic study of appropriate trimming procedures of
trees.
