A tree-coloring of a maximal planar graph is a proper vertex $4$-coloring
such that every bichromatic subgraph, induced by this coloring, is a tree. A
maximal planar graph $G$ is tree-colorable if $G$ has a tree-coloring. In this
article, we prove that a tree-colorable maximal planar graph $G$ with
$\delta(G)\geq 4$ contains at least four odd-vertices.
  Moreover, for a tree-colorable maximal planar graph of minimum degree 4 that
contains exactly four odd-vertices, we show that the subgraph induced by its
four odd-vertices is not a claw and contains no triangles.
