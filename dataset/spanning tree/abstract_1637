We study the set of NBC sets (no broken circuit sets) of the Linial
arrangement and deduce a constructive bijection to the set of local binary
search trees. We then generalize this construction to two families of Linial
type arrangements for which the bijections are with some $k$-ary labelled trees
that we introduce for this purpose.
