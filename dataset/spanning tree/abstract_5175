We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an L_1 (or
equivalently L_infinity) metric, and show that with certain additional
conditions such metrics are injective. We use this construction to find the
tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs, and we find an injective metric
that approximates the distances in the hyperbolic plane analogously to the way
the rectilinear metrics approximate the Euclidean distance.
