Let $X$ be a compact complex manifold of dimension $n\ge 2$ and $\ce$ an
ample vector bundle of rank $r<n$ on $X$. As the continuation of Part I, we
further study the properties of $g(X,\ce)$ that is an invariant for pairs
$(X,\ce)$ and is equal to curve genus when $r=n-1$. Main results are the
classifications of $(X,\ce)$ with $g(X,\ce)=2$ (resp. 3) when $\ce$ has a
regular section (resp. $\ce$ is ample and spanned) and $1<r<n-1$.
