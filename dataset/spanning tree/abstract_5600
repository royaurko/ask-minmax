We derive a general scaling relation for the anomalous Hall effect in
ferromagnetic metals involving multiple competing scattering mechanisms,
described by a quadratic hypersurface in the space spanned by the partial
resistivities. We also present experimental findings, which show strong
deviation from previously found scaling forms when different scattering
mechanism compete in strength but can be nicely explained by our theory.
