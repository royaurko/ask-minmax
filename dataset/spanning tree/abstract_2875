An infinite dimensional notion of asymptotic structure is considered. This
notion is developed in terms of trees and branches on Banach spaces. Every
countably infinite countably branching tree $\mathcal T$ of a certain type on a
space X is presumed to have a branch with some property. It is shown that then
X can be embedded into a space with an FDD $(E_i)$ so that all normalized
sequences in X which are almost a skipped blocking of $(E_i)$ have that
property. As an application of our work we prove that if X is a separable
reflexive Banach space and for some $1<p<\infty$ and $C<\infty$ every weakly
null tree $\mathcal T$ on the sphere of X has a branch C-equivalent to the unit
vector basis of $\ell_p$, then for all $\epsilon>0$, there exists a finite
codimensional subspace of X which $C^2+\epsilon$ embeds into the $\ell_p$ sum
of finite dimensional spaces.
