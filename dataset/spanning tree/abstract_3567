Every $k$-tree has book thickness at most $k+1$, and this bound is best
possible for all $k\geq3$. Vandenbussche et al. (2009) proved that every
$k$-tree that has a smooth degree-3 tree decomposition with width $k$ has book
thickness at most $k$. We prove this result is best possible for $k\geq 4$, by
constructing a $k$-tree with book thickness $k+1$ that has a smooth degree-4
tree decomposition with width $k$. This solves an open problem of Vandenbussche
et al. (2009)
