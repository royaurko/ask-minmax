We present the results of HI observations of five groups of galaxies spanning
a range of velocity dispersion and spiral fraction (brightest optical group
member in parenthesis): NGC 7582 (NGC 7552), USGC U207 (NGC 2759), USGC U070
(NGC 664), USGC U412 (NGC 3822), USGC U451 (NGC 4065). Neutral intragroup gas
is detected in three of the five groups. We present the discovery of a
previously uncataloged galaxy in the USGC U070 group at RA(2000)= 01h45m27s,
Dec(2000) = +04d36'19" which we are designating FSW J014526.92+043619.1. We
compile an HI mass function for the group environment and find that the
faint-end slope is consistent with being flat.
