We study the sofic tree shifts of $A^{\Sigma^*}$, where $\Sigma^*$ is a
regular rooted tree of finite rank. In particular, we give their
characterization in terms of unrestricted Rabin automata. We show that if $X
\subset A^{\Sigma^*}$ is a sofic tree shift, then the configurations in $X$
whose orbit under the shift action is finite are dense in $X$, and, as a
consequence of this, we deduce that every injective cellular automata
$\tau\colon X \to X$ is surjective. Moreover, a characterization of sofic tree
shifts in terms of general Rabin automata is given.
  We present an algorithm for establishing whether two unrestricted Rabin
automata accept the same sofic tree shift or not. This allows us to prove the
decidability of the surjectivity problem for cellular automata between sofic
tree shifts. We also prove the decidability of the injectivity problem for
cellular automata defined on a tree shift of finite type.
