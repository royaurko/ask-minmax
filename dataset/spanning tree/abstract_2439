We give a new, simple construction of the $\alpha$-stable tree for $\alpha
\in (1,2]$. We obtain it as the closure of an increasing sequence of
$\mathbb{R}$-trees inductively built by gluing together line-segments one by
one. The lengths of these line-segments are related to the the increments of an
increasing $\mathbb{R}_+$-valued Markov chain. For $\alpha = 2$, we recover
Aldous' line-breaking construction of the Brownian continuum random tree based
on an inhomogeneous Poisson process.
