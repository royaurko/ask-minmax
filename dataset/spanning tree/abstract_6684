In this paper we study homogeneous Gibbs measures on a Cayley tree, subjected
to an infinite-temperature Glauber evolution, and consider their (non-)Gibbsian
properties. We show that the intermediate Gibbs state (which in zero field is
the free-boundary-condition Gibbs state) behaves different from the plus and
the minus state. E.g. at large times, all configurations are bad for the
intermediate state, whereas the plus configuration never is bad for the plus
state. Moreover, we show that for each state there are two transitions. For the
intermediate state there is a transition from a Gibbsian regime to a
non-Gibbsian regime where some, but not all con?gurations are bad, and a second
one to a regime where all configurations are bad. For the plus and minus state,
the two transitions are from a Gibbsian regime to a non-Gibbsian one and then
back to a Gibbsian regime again.
