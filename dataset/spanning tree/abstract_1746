We give a formula for counting tree modules for the quiver S_g with g loops
and one vertex in terms of tree modules on its universal cover. This formula,
along with work of Helleloid and Rodriguez-Villegas, is used to show that the
number of d-dimensional tree modules for S_g is polynomial in g with the same
degree and leading coefficient as the counting polynomial A_{S_g}(d, q) for
absolutely indecomposables over F_q, evaluated at q=1.
