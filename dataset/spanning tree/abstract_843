We propose a new graph metric and study its properties. In contrast to the
standard distance in connected graphs, it takes into account all paths between
vertices. Formally, it is defined as d(i,j)=q_{ii}+q_{jj}-q_{ij}-q_{ji}, where
q_{ij} is the (i,j)-entry of the {\em relative forest accessibility matrix}
Q(\epsilon)=(I+\epsilon L)^{-1}, L is the Laplacian matrix of the (weighted)
(multi)graph, and \epsilon is a positive parameter. By the matrix-forest
theorem, the (i,j)-entry of the relative forest accessibility matrix of a graph
provides the specific number of spanning rooted forests such that i and j
belong to the same tree rooted at i. Extremely simple formulas express the
modification of the proposed distance under the basic graph transformations. We
give a topological interpretation of d(i,j) in terms of the probability of
unsuccessful linking i and j in a model of random links. The properties of this
metric are compared with those of some other graph metrics. An application of
this metric is related to clustering procedures such as "centered partition."
In another procedure, the relative forest accessibility and the corresponding
distance serve to choose the centers of the clusters and to assign a cluster to
each non-central vertex. The notion of cumulative weight of connections between
two vertices is proposed. The reasoning involves a reciprocity principle for
weighted multigraphs. Connections between the resistance distance and the
forest distance are established.
