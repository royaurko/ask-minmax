From a volume limited sample of 45,542 galaxies and 6,000 groups with $z \leq
0.213$ we use an adapted minimal spanning tree algorithm to identify and
classify large scale structures within the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA)
survey. Using galaxy groups, we identify 643 filaments across the three
equatorial GAMA fields that span up to 200 $h^{-1}$ Mpc in length, each with an
average of 8 groups within them. By analysing galaxies not belonging to groups
we identify a secondary population of smaller coherent structures composed
entirely of galaxies, dubbed `tendrils' that appear to link filaments together,
or penetrate into voids, generally measuring around 10 $h^{-1}$ Mpc in length
and containing on average 6 galaxies. Finally we are also able to identify a
population of isolated void galaxies. By running this algorithm on GAMA mock
galaxy catalogues we compare the characteristics of large scale structure
between observed and mock data; finding that mock filaments reproduce observed
ones extremely well. This provides a probe of higher order distribution
statistics not captured by the popularly used two-point correlation function.
