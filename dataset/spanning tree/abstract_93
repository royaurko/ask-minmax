Complete combinatorial characterisations of minimally rigid 2-dimensional
bar-joint frameworks with either reflectional or half-turn symmetry are
established for norms with unit ball a quadrilateral. These characterisations
are given in terms of packings of edge-disjoint symmetric spanning trees and
are obtained via a new Henneberg-type inductive construction scheme. Dually,
these results may be regarded as rigidity characterisations of graphs which
admit a Z_2-action with respect to which the graph is an edge-disjoint union of
two symmetric spanning trees and has either two or no fixed edges.
