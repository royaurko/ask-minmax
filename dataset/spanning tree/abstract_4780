In this series of papers we investigate the orbital structure of 3D models
representing barred galaxies. In the present introductory paper we use a
fiducial case to describe all families of periodic orbits that may play a role
in the morphology of three-dimensional bars. We show that, in a 3D bar, the
backbone of the orbital structure is not just the x1 family, as in 2D models,
but a tree of 2D and 3D families bifurcating from x1. Besides the main tree we
have also found another group of families of lesser importance around the
radial 3:1 resonance. The families of this group bifurcate from x1 and
influence the dynamics of the system only locally. We also find that 3D orbits
elongated along the bar minor axis can be formed by bifurcations of the planar
x2 family. They can support 3D bar-like structures along the minor axis of the
main bar. Banana-like orbits around the stable Lagrangian points build a forest
of 2D and 3D families as well. The importance of the 3D x1-tree families at the
outer parts of the bar depends critically on whether they are introduced in the
system as bifurcations in $z$ or in $\dot{z}$.
