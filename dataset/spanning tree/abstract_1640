The classical Ramsey theorem was generalized in two major ways: to the dual
Ramsey theorem, by Graham and Rothschild, and to Ramsey theorems for trees,
initially by Deuber and Leeb. Bringing these two lines of thought together, we
prove the dual Ramsey theorem for trees. Galois connections between partial
orders are used in formulating this theorem, while the abstract approach to
Ramsey theory, we developed earlier, is used in its proof.
