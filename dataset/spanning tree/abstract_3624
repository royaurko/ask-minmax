We discuss the duality theorem, which provides a relation between loop
integrals and phase space integrals. We rederive the duality relation for the
one-loop case and extend it to two and higher-order loops. We explicitly show
its application to two- and three-loop scalar master integrals and discuss the
structure of the occurring cuts.
