We study the Bergman complex B(M) of a matroid M: a polyhedral complex which
arises in algebraic geometry, but which we describe purely combinatorially. We
prove that a natural subdivision of the Bergman complex of M is a geometric
realization of the order complex of its lattice of flats. In addition, we show
that the Bergman fan B'(K_n) of the graphical matroid of the complete graph K_n
is homeomorphic to the space of phylogenetic trees T_n.
