We prove that the linearly controlled asymptotic dimension of the fundamental
group of any 3-dimensional graph-manifold does not exceed 7. As applications we
obtain that the universal cover of such a graph-manifold is an absolute
Lipschitz retract and it admits a quasisymmetric embedding into the product of
8 metric trees.
