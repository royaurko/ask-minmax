In order to study the dust properties of different galaxies in the nearby
Universe, the SPIRE extragalactic group selected a volume limited (15$<$ $D$
$<$25 Mpc), complete sample of 313 galaxies spanning the whole range in
morphological type (from ellipticals to late-type spirals) and luminosity (8.5
$<$ log $L_H$ $<$ 12 L$_H\odot$, -22 $<$ $M_B$ $<$ -16) extracted from 2MASS,
to be observed in guaranteed time with Herschel. The 250-360-520 $\mu$m SPIRE
data, combined with those collected at other frequencies, will be used to trace
the dust properties of normal galaxies and provide a reference sample for
studies at high redshift.
