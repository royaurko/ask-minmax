This paper is a copy of an unpublished study of the filtering effect of red
maple trees (acer rubrum) on fission product fallout near Binghamton, NY, USA
following the 1986 Chernobyl accident. The conclusions of this work may offer
some insight into what is happening in the forests exposed to fallout from the
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant accident. This posting is in memory of Noel K.
Yeh.
