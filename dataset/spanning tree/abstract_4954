As demonstrated in Barden et al. (2013) for ${\boldsymbol T}_{\!4}$, the
space of phylogenetic trees with four leaves, the global, as well as the local,
topological structure of the space plays an important role in the non-classical
limiting behaviour of the sample Fr\'echet means of a probability distribution
on ${\boldsymbol T}_{\!4}$. Nevertheless, the techniques used in that paper
were specific to ${\boldsymbol T}_{\!4}$ and cannot be adapted to analyse
Fr\'echet means in the space ${\boldsymbol T}_{\!m}$ of phylogenetic trees with
$m(\geqslant5)$ leaves. To investigate the latter, this paper first studies the
log map of ${\boldsymbol T}_{\!m}$, a generalisation of the inverse of the
exponential map on a Riemannian manifold. Then, in terms of a modified version
of the log map, we characterise Fr\'echet means in ${\boldsymbol T}_{\!m}$ and
derive the limiting distributions for sample Fr\'echet means, generalising the
results in Barden et al. (2013). In particular, the results show that, although
they are related to the Gaussian distribution, the forms taken by the limiting
distributions depend on the co-dimensions of the strata in which the Fr\'echet
means lie.
