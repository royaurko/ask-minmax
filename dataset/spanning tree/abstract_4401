The number of self-adjoint extensions of a symmetric operator acting on a
complex Hilbert space is characterized by its deficiency indices. Given a
locally finite unoriented simple tree, we prove that the deficiency indices of
any discrete Schr\"odinger operator are either null or infinite. We also prove
that almost surely, there is a tree such that all discrete Schr\"odinger
operators are essentially self-adjoint. Furthermore, we provide several
criteria of essential self-adjointness. We also adress some importance to the
case of the adjacency matrix and conjecture that, given a locally finite
unoriented simple graph, its the deficiency indices are either null or
infinite. Besides that, we consider some generalizations of trees and weighted
graphs.
