We construct quasi-isometry invariants of a one-ended finitely presented
group by considering the tree of cylinders of a two-ended JSJ decomposition of
the group. When the group satisfies additional quasi-isometric rigidity
hypotheses we construct finer invariants by also considering relative amounts
of stretching across edges of the tree of cylinders.
