We study dynamical behaviors of one-dimensional stochastic lattice gases with
repulsive interactions whose span can be arbitrary large. We endow the system
with a zero-temperature dynamics, so that the hops to empty sites which would
have led to the increase of energy are forbidden. We assume that the strength
of interactions sufficiently quickly decreases with the separation between the
particles, so that interactions can be treated in a lexicographic order. For
such repulsion processes with symmetric nearest-neighbor hopping we
analytically determine the density-dependent diffusion coefficient. We also
compute the variance of the displacement of a tagged particle.
