Evolutionary models of languages are usually considered to take the form of
trees. With the development of so-called tree constraints the plausibility of
the tree model assumptions can be addressed by checking whether the moments of
observed variables lie within regions consistent with trees. In our linguistic
application, the data set comprises acoustic samples (audio recordings) from
speakers of five Romance languages or dialects. We wish to assess these
functional data for compatibility with a hereditary tree model at the language
level. A novel combination of canonical function analysis (CFA) with a
separable covariance structure provides a method for generating a
representative basis for the data. This resulting basis is formed of components
which emphasize language differences whilst maintaining the integrity of the
observational language-groupings. A previously unexploited Gaussian tree
constraint is then applied to component-by-component projections of the data to
investigate adherence to an evolutionary tree. The results indicate that while
a tree model is unlikely to be suitable for modeling all aspects of the
acoustic linguistic data, certain features of the spoken Romance languages
highlighted by the separable-CFA basis may indeed be suitably modeled as a
tree.
