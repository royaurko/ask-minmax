We introduce generalizations of Aldous' Brownian Continuous Random Tree as
scaling limits for multicritical models of discrete trees. These discrete
models involve trees with fine-tuned vertex-dependent weights ensuring a k-th
root singularity in their generating function. The scaling limit involves
continuous trees with branching points of order up to k+1. We derive explicit
integral representations for the average profile of this k-th order
multicritical continuous random tree, as well as for its history distributions
measuring multi-point correlations. The latter distributions involve
non-positive universal weights at the branching points together with fractional
derivative couplings. We prove universality by rederiving the same results
within a purely continuous axiomatic approach based on the resolution of a set
of consistency relations for the multi-point correlations. The average profile
is shown to obey a fractional differential equation whose solution involves
hypergeometric functions and matches the integral formula of the discrete
approach.
