This paper has two parts, on Baumslag-Solitar groups and on general G-trees.
  In the first part we establish bounds for stable commutator length (scl) in
Baumslag-Solitar groups. For a certain class of elements, we further show that
scl is computable and takes rational values. We also determine exactly which of
these elements admit extremal surfaces.
  In the second part we establish a universal lower bound of 1/12 for scl of
suitable elements of any group acting on a tree. This is achieved by
constructing efficient quasimorphisms. Calculations in the group BS(2,3) show
that this is the best possible universal bound, thus answering a question of
Calegari and Fujiwara. We also establish scl bounds for acylindrical tree
actions.
  Returning to Baumslag-Solitar groups, we show that their scl spectra have a
uniform gap: no element has scl in the interval (0, 1/12).
