We investigate (lower) packing and (lower) open packing numbers in graphs. We
bound these two parameters from below in terms of order, maximum degree and the
number of support vertices. These sharp lower bounds can be applied for trees,
appropriately. Also, we give upper bounds on (total) domination number of
trees.
