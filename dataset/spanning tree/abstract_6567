We study the abelian sandpile model on a random binary tree. Using a transfer
matrix approach introduced by Dhar & Majumdar, we prove exponential decay of
correlations, and in a small supercritical region (i.e., where the branching
process survives with positive probability) exponential decay of avalanche
sizes. This shows a phase transition phenomenon between exponential decay and
power law decay of avalanche sizes. Our main technical tools are: (1) A
recursion for the ratio between the numbers of weakly and strongly allowed
configurations which is proved to have a well-defined stochastic solution; (2)
quenched and annealed estimates of the eigenvalues of a product of $n$ random
transfer matrices.
