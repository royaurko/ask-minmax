When the boundary of a familiar object is shown by a series of isolated dots,
humans can often recognize the object with ease. This ability can be sustained
with addition of distracting dots around the object. However, such capability
has not been reproduced algorithmically on computers. We introduce a new
algorithm that groups a set of dots into multiple non-disjoint subsets. It
connects the dots into a spanning tree using the proximity cue. It then applies
the straight polygon transformation to an initial polygon derived from the
spanning tree. The straight polygon divides the space into polygons recursively
and each polygon can be viewed as grouping of a subset of the dots. The number
of polygons generated is O($n$). We also introduce simple shape selection and
recognition algorithms that can be applied to the grouping result. We used both
natural and synthetic images to show effectiveness of these algorithms.
