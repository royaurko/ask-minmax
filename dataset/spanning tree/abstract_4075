We propose a model for a market which structure is of the tree form. Each
branch of the tree is composed by identical firms, its root (the branch of the
first level) is formed by the firms producing raw material, and the branches of
the last level are the retail outlets. The branching points (tree nodes) are
micromarkets for firms forming branches connected with a given node. The prices
and the production rate are controlled by the ballance in supply and demand,
the competition is assumed to be perfect. We show that such a market functions
perfectly: the prices are specified by the production expense only, whereas
demand determines the production rate.
  We construct an efficiency functional which extremal gives the governing
equations for the market. It turns out that this ideal market is degenerated
with respect to its structure. It is shown, that such market functions ideally:
the prices are determined by the costs on production of the goods, and the
level of production of the goods of any kind defined only by demand for the
goods of this sort.
