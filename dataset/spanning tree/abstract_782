It is well known that the edge vector space of an oriented graph can be
decomposed in terms of cycles and cocycles (alias cuts, or bonds), and that a
basis for the cycle and the cocycle spaces can be generated by adding and
removing edges to an arbitrarily chosen spanning tree. In this paper we show
that the edge vector space can also be decomposed in terms of cycles and the
generating edges of cocycles (called cochords), or of cocycles and the
generating edges of cycles (called chords). From this observation follows a
construction in terms of oblique complementary projection operators. We employ
this algebraic construction to prove several properties of unweighted
Kirchhoff-Symanzik matrices, encoding the mutual superposition between cycles
and cocycles. In particular, we prove that dual matrices of planar graphs have
the same spectrum (up to multiplicities). We briefly comment on how this
construction provides a refined formalization of Kirchhoff's mesh analysis of
electrical circuits, which has lately been applied to generic thermodynamic
networks.
