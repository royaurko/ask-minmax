We define an analog of Plancherel measure for the set of rooted unlabeled
trees on n vertices, and a Markov chain which has this measure as its
stationary distribution. Using the combinatorics of commutation relations, we
show that order n^2 steps are necessary and suffice for convergence to the
stationary distribution.
