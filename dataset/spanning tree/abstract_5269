We show that for any set A in a finite Abelian group G that has at least c
|A|^3 solutions to a_1 + a_2 = a_3 + a_4, where a_i belong A there exist sets
A' in A and L in G, |L| \ll c^{-1} log |A| such that A' is contained in Span of
L and A' has approximately c |A|^3 solutions to a'_1 + a'_2 = a'_3 + a'_4,
where a'_i belong A'. We also study so-called symmetric sets or, in other
words, sets of large values of convolution.
