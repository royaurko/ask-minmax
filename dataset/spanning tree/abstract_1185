This paper uses dualities between facet ideal theory and Stanley-Reisner
theory to show that the facet ideal of a simplicial tree is sequentially
Cohen-Macaulay. The proof involves showing that the Alexander dual (or the
cover dual, as we call it here) of a simplicial tree is a componentwise linear
ideal. We conclude with additional combinatorial properties of simplicial
trees.
