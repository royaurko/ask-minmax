In this paper we consider bi-Cohen-Macaulay graphs, and give a complete
classification of such graphs in the case they are bipartite or chordal.
General bi-Cohen-Macaulay graphs are classified up to separation. The
inseparable bi-Cohen-Macaulay graphs are determined. We establish a bijection
between the set of all trees and the set of inseparable bi-Cohen-Macaulay
graphs.
