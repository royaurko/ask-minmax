Birth-and-death models are now a common mathematical tool to describe
branching patterns observed in real-world phylogenetic trees. Liggett and
Schinazi (2009) is one such example. The contributors propose a simple
birth-and-death model that is compatible with phylogenetic trees of both
influenza and HIV, depending on the birth rate parameter. An interesting
special case of this model is the critical case where the birth rate equals the
death rate. This is a non-trivial situation and to study its asymptotic
behaviour we employed the Laplace transform. With this we correct the proof of
Liggett and Schinazi (2009) in the critical case.
