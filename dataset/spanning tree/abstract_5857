The latest progress in calculating electroweak gauge boson production in
association with QCD jets at hadron colliders is summarized. Particular
emphasis is given to the recently completed QCD one-loop calculations of
W+3jets and Wb final states. Furthermore recent developments in improving Monte
Carlo event generators by means of combining tree-level matrix elements with
parton showers is reviewed.
