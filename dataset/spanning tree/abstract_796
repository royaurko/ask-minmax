We provide an exact expression for the statistics of the fluxes of Markov
jump processes at all times, improving on asymptotic results from large
deviation theory. The main ingredient is a generalization of the BEST theorem
in enumeratoric graph theory to Eulerian tours with open ends. In the long-time
limit we reobtain Sanov's theorem for Markov processes, which expresses the
exponential suppression of fluctuations in terms of relative entropy. The
finite-time power-law term, increasingly important with the system size, is a
spanning-tree determinant that, by introducing Grassmann variables, can be
absorbed into the effective Lagrangian of a Fermionic ghost field on a metric
space, coupled to a gauge potential. With reference to concepts in
nonequilibrium stochastic thermodynamics, the metric is related to the
dynamical activity that measures net communication between states, and the
connection is made to a previous gauge theory for diffusion processes.
