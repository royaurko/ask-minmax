Building on work by Desjarlais, Molina, Faase, and others, a general method
is obtained for counting the number of spanning trees of graphs that are a
product of an arbitrary graph and either a path or a cycle, of which grid
graphs are a subclass. Results are obtained pertaining to recurrences obtained
in this manner, and numerous new integer sequences are found.
