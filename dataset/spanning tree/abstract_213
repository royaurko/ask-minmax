The integrand of any multi-loop integral is characterised after Feynman
parametrisation by two polynomials. In this review we summarise the properties
of these polynomials. Topics covered in this article include among others:
Spanning trees and spanning forests, the all-minors matrix-tree theorem,
recursion relations due to contraction and deletion of edges, Dodgson's
identity and matroids.
