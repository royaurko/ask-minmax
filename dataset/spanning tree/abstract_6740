We consider the problem of constructing efficient P2P overlays for sensornets
providing "Energy-Level Application and Services". The method presented in
\cite{SOPXM09} presents a novel P2P overlay for Energy Level discovery in a
sensornet. However, this solution is not dynamic, since requires periodical
restructuring. In particular, it is not able to support neither join of
sensor\_nodes with energy level out of the ranges supported by the existing p2p
overlay nor leave of \emph{empty} overlay\_peers to which no sensor\_nodes are
currently associated. On this purpose and based on the efficient P2P method
presented in \cite{SPSTMT10}, we design a dynamic P2P overlay for Energy Level
discovery in a sensornet, the so-called SART (Sensors' Autonomous Range Tree).
The adaptation of the P2P index presented in \cite{SPSTMT10} guarantees the
best-known dynamic query performance of the above operation. We experimentally
verify this performance, via the D-P2P-Sim simulator (D-P2P-Sim is publicly
available at http://code.google.com/p/d-p2p-sim/).
