We establish upper and lower bounds on the dimension of the space spanned by
the symmetric powers of the natural character of generalised symmetric groups.
We adapt the methods of Savitt and Stanley from their paper `A note on the
symmetric powers of the standard representation of $S_n$' (The Electronic
Journal of Combinatorics 7 (2000), R6) to obtain bounds both over the complex
numbers and in prime characteristic.
