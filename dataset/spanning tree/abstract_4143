Free ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory (in the large $N$ limit) is dual to
an, as yet, intractable closed string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$. We aim to
implement open-closed string duality in this system and thereby recast the free
field correlation functions as amplitudes in $AdS$. The basic strategy is to
implement this duality directly on planar field theory correlation functions in
the worldline (or first quantised) formulation. The worldline loops (remnants
of the worldsheet holes) close to form tree diagrams. These tree diagrams are
then to be manifested as tree amplitudes in $AdS$ by a change of variables on
the worldline moduli space (i.e. Schwinger parameter space). Restricting to
twist two operators, we are able to carry through this program for two and
three point functions. However, it appears that this strategy can be
implemented for four and higher point functions as well. An analogy to
electrical networks is very useful in this regard.
