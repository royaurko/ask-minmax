In [9] Kaimanovich introduced the concept of augmented tree on the symbolic
space of a self-similar set. It is hyperbolic in the sense of Gromov, and it
was shown in [13] that under the open set condition, a self-similar set can be
identified with the hyperbolic boundary of the tree. In the paper, we
investigate in detail a class of simple augmented trees and the Lipschitz
equivalence of such trees. The main purpose is to use this to study the
Lipschitz equivalence problem of the totally disconnected self-similar sets
which has been undergoing some extensive development recently.
