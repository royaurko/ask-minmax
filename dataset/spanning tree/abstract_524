The paper addresses a new class of combinatorial problems which consist in
restructuring of solutions (as structures) in combinatorial optimization. Two
main features of the restructuring process are examined: (i) a cost of the
restructuring, (ii) a closeness to a goal solution. This problem corresponds to
redesign (improvement, upgrade) of modular systems or solutions. The
restructuring approach is described and illustrated for the following
combinatorial optimization problems: knapsack problem, multiple choice problem,
assignment problem, spanning tree problems. Examples illustrate the
restructuring processes.
