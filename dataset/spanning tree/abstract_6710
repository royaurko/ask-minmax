The usefulness of annotated corpora is greatly increased if there is an
associated tool that can allow various kinds of operations to be performed in a
simple way. Different kinds of annotation frameworks and many query languages
for them have been proposed, including some to deal with multiple layers of
annotation. We present here an easy to learn query language for a particular
kind of annotation framework based on 'threaded trees', which are somewhere
between the complete order of a tree and the anarchy of a graph. Through
'typed' threads, they can allow multiple levels of annotation in the same
document. Our language has a simple, intuitive and concise syntax and high
expressive power. It allows not only to search for complicated patterns with
short queries but also allows data manipulation and specification of arbitrary
return values. Many of the commonly used tasks that otherwise require writing
programs, can be performed with one or more queries. We compare the language
with some others and try to evaluate it.
