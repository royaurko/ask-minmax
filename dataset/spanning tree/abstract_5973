We provide combinatorial rules to compute Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials for
the Hermitian symmetric pair $(B_N,A_{N-1})$ when the Hecke algebra has unequal
parameters. They are obtained by filling regions delimited by paths with ballot
strips. We also extend the binary tree algorithm introduced by Lascoux and
Sch\"utzenberger to our case.
