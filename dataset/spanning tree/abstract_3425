The program MadGraph is presented which automatically generates postscript
Feynman diagrams and Fortran code to calculate arbitrary tree level helicity
amplitudes by calling HELAS[1] subroutines. The program is written in Fortran
and is available in Unix and VMS versions. MadGraph currently includes standard
model interactions of QCD and QFD, but is easily modified to include additional
models such as supersymmetry.
