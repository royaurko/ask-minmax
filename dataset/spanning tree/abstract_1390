We consider random binary trees that appear as the output of certain standard
algorithms for sorting and searching if the input is random. We introduce the
subtree size metric on search trees and show that the resulting metric spaces
converge with probability 1. This is then used to obtain almost sure
convergence for various tree functionals, together with representations of the
respective limit random variables as functions of the limit tree.
