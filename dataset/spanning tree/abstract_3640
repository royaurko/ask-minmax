This paper deals with the replica placement problem on fully homogeneous tree
networks known as the Replica Placement optimization problem. The client
requests are known beforehand, while the number and location of the servers are
to be determined. We investigate the latter problem using the Closest access
policy when adding QoS and bandwidth constraints. We propose an optimal
algorithm in two passes using dynamic programming.
