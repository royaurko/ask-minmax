We identify a premouse inner model $L[\mathbb{E}]$, such that for any
coarsely iterable background universe $R$ modelling $\mathsf{ZFC}$,
$L[\mathbb{E}]^R$ is a proper class premouse of $R$ inheriting all strong and
Woodin cardinals from $R$, and iteration trees on $L[\mathbb{E}]^R$ lift to
coarse iteration trees on $R$.
  We also prove that a slight weakening of $(k+1)$-condensation follows from
$(k,\omega_1+1)$-iterability in place of $(k,\omega_1,\omega_1+1)$-iterability.
We also prove that full $(k+1)$-condensation follows from
$(k,\omega_1+1)$-iterability and $(k+1)$-solidity.
  We also prove general facts regarding generalizations of bicephali; these
facts are needed in the proofs of the results above.
