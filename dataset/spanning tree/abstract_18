A drawing of a given (abstract) tree that is a minimum spanning tree of the
vertex set is considered aesthetically pleasing. However, such a drawing can
only exist if the tree has maximum degree at most 6. What can be said for trees
of higher degree? We approach this question by supposing that a partition or
covering of the tree by subtrees of bounded degree is given. Then we show that
if the partition or covering satisfies some natural properties, then there is a
drawing of the entire tree such that each of the given subtrees is drawn as a
minimum spanning tree of its vertex set.
