We prove existence and regularity of minimizers for Lipschitz integrands over
general surfaces of arbitrary dimension and codimension in \( \R^n \),
satisfying a cohomological boundary condition. Our result specializes to a
version of Plateau's problem in the case of a constant integrand. We generalize
and extend methods of Reifenberg, Besicovitch, and Adams; in particular, we
prove an asymptotic monotonicity result (density exists in the absence of true
monotonicity,) we generalize a type of minimizing sequence used by Reifenberg
(whose limits have nice properties, including lower bounds on lower density and
finite Hausdorff measure,) and develop cohomological spanning conditions.
