A subgraph $H$ of a graph $G$ is called spanning, if any vertex of $G$ is not
isolated in $H$, while it is called maximum $k$-edge-colorable, if $H$ is
$k$-edge-colorable and contains as many edges as possible. We introduce three
parameters that are related with spanning $k$-edge-colorable subgraphs. Our
first result states that these parameters are the same. This allows us to
introduce the fourth parameter $sp(G)$ that equals to the common value of the
mentioned three parameters. We show that $\Delta(G)$ is an upper bound for
$sp(G)$, and then we offer a characterization of graphs with $sp(G)=\Delta(G)$.
Finally, we prove some bounds for $sp(G)$ that involve well-known
graph-theoretic parameters.
