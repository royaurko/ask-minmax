We examine the hadronic interactions of quarkonia, focusing on the decays
psi(2s)->psi pi pi and upsilon(2s)-> upsilon pi pi. The leading gluonic
operators in the multipole expansion are matched onto the chiral lagrangian
with the coefficients fit to available data, both at tree-level and loop-level
in the chiral expansion. A comparison is made with naive expectations loosely
based on the large-$N_c$ limit of QCD in an effort to determine the reliability
of this limit for other observables, such as the binding of $\ps$ to nuclei.
Crossing symmetry is used to estimate the cross-section for inelastic
$\pi\ps\to\pi\pss$ scattering, potentially relevant for heavy ion collisions.
The radiative decays psi(2s)->psi pi pi gamma and upsilon(2s)-> upsilon pi pi
gamma are determined at tree-level in the chiral lagrangian. Measurement of
such decays will provide a test of the multipole and chiral expansions. We
briefly discuss decays from the upsilon(3s) and also the contribution from
pions to the electromagnetic polarizability of quarkonia.
