We (1) characterize the Schubert varieties that arise as variations of Hodge
structure (VHS); (2) show that the isotropy orbits of the infinitesimal
Schubert VHS `span' the space of all infinitesimal VHS; and (3) show that the
cohomology classes dual the Schubert VHS form a basis of the invariant
characteristic cohomology associated to the infinitesimal period relation
(a.k.a. Griffiths transversality).
