Progressive methods offer efficient and reasonably good solutions to the
multiple sequence alignment problem. However, resulting alignments are biased
by guide-trees, especially for relatively distant sequences.
  We propose MSARC, a new graph-clustering based algorithm that aligns sequence
sets without guide-trees. Experiments on the BAliBASE dataset show that MSARC
achieves alignment quality similar to best progressive methods and
substantially higher than the quality of other non-progressive algorithms.
Furthermore, MSARC outperforms all other methods on sequence sets with the
similarity structure hardly represented by a phylogenetic tree. Furthermore,
MSARC outperforms all other methods on sequence sets whose evolutionary
distances are hardly representable by a phylogenetic tree. These datasets are
most exposed to the guide-tree bias of alignments.
