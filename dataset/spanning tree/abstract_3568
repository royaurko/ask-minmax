The ferromagnetic properties of the spin-1 BEG model on finite-size Cayley
tree are investigated using the exact recursion method. The spontaneous
magnetization of the system is studied in detail for different values of the
reduced crystal-field interaction D/J, and it is found that there is an unusual
behavior (anti-Curie temperature) when D/J>2.0. We also obtain the Curie
temperature of this finite-size system. When the system size is large enough,
our results will fit well with that in the thermodynamic limit.
