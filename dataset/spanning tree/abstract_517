Uniform spanning trees on finite graphs and their analogues on infinite
graphs are a well-studied area. On a Cayley graph of a group, we show that they
are related to the first $\ell^2$-Betti number of the group. Our main aim,
however, is to present the basic elements of a higher-dimensional analogue on
finite and infinite CW-complexes, which relate to the higher $\ell^2$-Betti
numbers. One consequence is a uniform isoperimetric inequality extending work
of Lyons, Pichot, and Vassout. We also present an enumeration similar to recent
work of Duval, Klivans, and Martin.
