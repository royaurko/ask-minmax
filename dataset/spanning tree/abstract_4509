We construct the tree-valued Fleming-Viot process pathwise from the lookdown
model. The tree-valued Fleming-Viot process was introduced by Greven,
Pfaffelhuber, and Winter [Probab. Theory Related Fields (2013)], it has a.s.
continuous paths. We generalize this process to include the cases with multiple
reproduction events and simultaneous multiple reproduction events. In
particular, we include the case with dust. We obtain a process with a.s.
c\`adl\`ag paths and jumps at the times of large reproduction events. We state
well-posed martingale problems. In case that the associated coalescent comes
down from infinity, the construction from the lookdown model allows to read off
a process with values in the space of measure-preserving isometry classes of
compact metric measure spaces, endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prohorov
metric. This process has a.s. c\`adl\`ag paths with additional jumps at the
times when old families become extinct.
