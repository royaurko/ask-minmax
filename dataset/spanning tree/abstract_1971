Pairwise ordered tree alignment is an important pattern matching problem,
motivated by RNA secondary structure comparison for example, that can be solved
efficiently using Dynamic Programming (DP). An inquiry into the multiplicity of
optimal solutions, as well as the existence of potentially interesting
sub-optimal solutions, naturally motivates the question of exploring the space
of all, optimal and sub-optimal, tree alignments. There are well-known DP-based
techniques that allow for such an exploration, but they require completeness
and unambiguity of the DP scheme, i.e. the existence of a score-preserving
bijection between the search space and the set of possible derivations of the
DP scheme. In this paper, we present the first unambiguous and complete dynamic
programming algorithm for the alignment of a pair of ordered rooted trees. Our
algorithm optimally aligns two trees of size $n\_1$ and $n\_2$ in $\Theta(n\_1
n\_2 max(n\_1, n\_2)^2)$ time in the worst-case scenario. Assuming
uniformly-drawn random trees as input, it has average-case time and space
complexities in $\Theta(n\_1 n\_2)$.
