We show that the independence polytope of every regular matroid has an
extended formulation of size quadratic in the size of its ground set. This
generalizes a similar statement for (co-)graphic matroids, which is a simple
consequence of Martin's extended formulation for the spanning-tree polytope. In
our construction, we make use of Seymour's decomposition theorem for regular
matroids. As a consequence, the extended formulations can be computed in
polynomial time.
