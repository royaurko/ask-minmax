The presence of light scalars can have profound effects on early universe
cosmology, influencing its thermal history as well as paradigms like inflation
and baryogenesis. Effective supergravity provides a framework to make
quantifiable, model-independent studies of these effects. The Riemanian
curvature of the Kahler manifold spanned by scalars belonging to chiral
superfields, evaluated along supersymmetry breaking directions, provides an
order parameter (in the sense that it must necessarily take certain values) for
phenomena as diverse as slow roll modular inflation, non-thermal cosmological
histories, and the viability of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. Within certain
classes of UV completions, the order parameter for theories with $n$ scalar
moduli is conjectured to be related to invariants of $n$-ary cubic forms (for
example, for models with three moduli, the order parameter is given by the ring
of invariants spanned by the Aronhold invariants). Within these completions,
and under the caveats spelled out, this may provide an avenue to obtain
necessary conditions for the above phenomena that are in principle calculable
given nothing but the intersection numbers of a Calabi-Yau compactification
geometry. As an additional result, abstract relations between holomorphic
sectional and bisectional curvatures are utilized to constrain Affleck-Dine
baryogenesis on a wide class of Kahler geometries.
