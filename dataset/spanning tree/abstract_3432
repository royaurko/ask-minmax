Supersymmetry without R-parity contains new tree-level contributions to
B-decays. A brief summary is provided of the current experimental bounds on
those tree-level contributions which are relevant to B physics. Signals to look
for are outlined in the context of CP violation and rare decays. For the first
time, the signature of general R-parity violating models is described.
B-factory experiments will provide an opportunity to look for this signal.
