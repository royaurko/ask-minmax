We study coupled maps on a Cayley tree, with local (nearest-neighbor)
interactions, and with a variety of boundary conditions. The homogeneous state
(where every lattice site has the same value) and the node-synchronized state
(where sites of a given generation have the same value) are both shown to occur
for particular values of the parameters and coupling constants. We study the
stability of these states and their domains of attraction. As the number of
sites that become synchronized is much higher compared to that on a regular
lattice, control is easier to effect. A general procedure is given to deduce
the eigenvalue spectrum for these states. Perturbations of the synchronized
state lead to different spatio-temporal structures. We find that a mean-field
like treatment is valid on this (effectively infinite dimensional) lattice.
