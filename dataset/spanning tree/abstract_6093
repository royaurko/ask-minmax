In this article we study Hamiltonian flows of smooth functions
$H:\mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}$ restricted to energy levels close to critical
levels. We assume the existence of a saddle-center equilibrium point $p_c \in
H^{-1}(0)$ lying on a strictly convex singular subset $S_0 \subset H^{-1}(0)$.
Then for all $E>0$ small, the energy level $H^{-1}(E)$ contains a subset $S_E$
near $S_0$, diffeomorphic to the closed $3$-ball, admitting a system of
transversal sections $\mathcal{F}_E$, called a $2-3$ foliation. $\mathcal{F}_E$
is a singular foliation of $S_E$ and contains two periodic orbits
$P_{2,E}\subset \partial S_E$ and $P_{3,E}\subset S_E\setminus \partial S_E$ as
binding orbits. $P_{2,E}$ is the hyperbolic orbit lying on the center manifold
of $p_c$, has Conley-Zehnder index $2$ and spans two rigid planes in $\partial
S_E$. $P_{3,E}$ has Conley-Zehnder index $3$ and spans a one parameter family
of planes in $S_E \setminus \partial S_E$. A rigid cylinder connecting
$P_{3,E}$ to $P_{2,E}$ completes $\mathcal{F}_E$. All regular leaves are
transverse to the Hamiltonian vector field. The existence of a homoclinic orbit
to $P_{2,E}$ in $S_E\setminus \partial S_E$ follows from this foliation.
