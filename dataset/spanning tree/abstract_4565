Concurrent time series commonly arise from monitoring of the environment such
as air quality measurement networks, weather stations, oceanographic buoys, or
in paleo form such as lake sediments, tree rings, ice cores, or coral isotopes,
with each monitoring or sampling site providing one of the time series. The
goal is to extract a common time trend or signal in the observed data. Other
examples where the goal is to extract a common time trend for multiple time
series are in stock price time series, neurological time series, and quality
control time series. For this purpose we develop properties of MAF [Maximum
Autocorrelation Factors] that linearly combines time series in order to
maximize the resulting signal-to-noise-ratio [SNR]. We quantify the SNR
advantages of MAF in comparison with PCA [Principal Components Analysis], a
commonly used method for linearly combining time series. We compare statistical
sample properties of MAF and PCA. Then, we apply both MAF and PCA to 21
concurrent tree-ring time series from the western US and compare the extracted
common time trends covering the period 1850-1998.
