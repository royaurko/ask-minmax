Convergence of binomial tree method and explicit difference schemes for the
variational inequality model of American put options with time dependent
coefficients is studied. When volatility is time dependent, it is not
reasonable to assume that the dynamics of the underlying asset's price forms a
binomial tree if a partition of time interval with equal parts is used. A time
interval partition method that allows binomial tree dynamics of the underlying
asset's price is provided. Conditions under which the prices of American put
option by BTM and explicit difference scheme have the monotonic property on
time variable are found. Convergence of BTM and explicit difference schemes for
the variational inequality model of American put options to viscosity solution
is proved.
