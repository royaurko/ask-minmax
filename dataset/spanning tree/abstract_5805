We show that nontrivial classical pretzel knots L(p,q,r) are hyperbolic with
eight exceptions which are torus knots. We find Conway polynomials of n-pretzel
links using a new computation tree. As applications, we compute the genera of
n-pretzel links using these polynomials and find the basket number of pretzel
links by showing that the genus and the canonical genus of a pretzel link are
the same.
