Consider a regular $d$-dimensional metric tree $\Gamma$ with root $o$. Define
the Schroedinger operator $-\Delta - V$, where $V$ is a non-negative, symmetric
potential, on $\Gamma$, with Neumann boundary conditions at $o$. Provided that
$V$ decays like $x^{-\gamma}$ at infinity, where $1 < \gamma \leq d \leq 2,
\gamma \neq 2$, we will determine the weak coupling behavior of the bottom of
the spectrum of $-\Delta - V$. In other words, we will describe the
asymptotical behavior of $\inf \sigma(-\Delta - \alpha V)$ as $\alpha \to 0+$
