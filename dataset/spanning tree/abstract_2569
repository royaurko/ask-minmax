The new 4D geometry whose Killing vectors span the Poincar\'e algebra is
presented and its structure is analyzed. The new geometry can be regarded as
the Poincar\'e-invariant solution of the degenerate extension of the vacuum
Einstein field equations with a negative cosmological constant and provides a
static cosmological space-time with a Lobachevsky space. The motion of free
particles in the space-time is discussed.
