We present the classical Stern-Brocot tree and provide a new proof of the
fact that every rational number between 0 and 1 appears in the tree. We then
generalize theStern-Brocot tree to allow for arbitrary choice of starting
terms, and prove that in all cases the tree maintains the property that every
rational number between the two starting terms appears exactly once.
