We present an approach to email filtering based on the suffix tree data
structure. A method for the scoring of emails using the suffix tree is
developed and a number of scoring and score normalisation functions are tested.
Our results show that the character level representation of emails and classes
facilitated by the suffix tree can significantly improve classification
accuracy when compared with the currently popular methods, such as naive Bayes.
We believe the method can be extended to the classification of documents in
other domains.
