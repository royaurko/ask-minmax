When combined properly, search techniques can reveal the full potential of
sophisticated branching heuristics. We demonstrate this observation on the
well-known class of random 3-SAT formulae. First, a new branching heuristic is
presented, which generalizes existing work on this class. Much smaller search
trees can be constructed by using this heuristic. Second, we introduce a
variant of discrepancy search, called ALDS. Theoretical and practical evidence
support that ALDS traverses the search tree in a near-optimal order when
combined with the new heuristic. Both techniques, search and heuristic, have
been implemented in the look-ahead solver march. The SAT 2009 competition
results show that march is by far the strongest complete solver on random k-SAT
formulae.
