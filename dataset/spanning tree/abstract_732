IRAS 20050+2720 is young star forming region at a distance of 700 pc without
apparent high mass stars. We present results of our multiwavelength study of
IRAS 20050+2720 which includes observations by Chandra and Spitzer, and 2MASS
and UBVRI photometry. In total, about 300 YSOs in different evolutionary stages
are found. We characterize the distribution of young stellar objects (YSOs) in
this region using a minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis. We newly identify a
second cluster core, which consists mostly of class II objects, about 10 arcmin
from the center of the cloud. YSOs of earlier evolutionary stages are more
clustered than more evolved objects. The X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of
IRAS 20050+2720 is roughly lognormal, but steeper than the XLF of the more
massive Orion nebula complex. IRAS 20050+2720 shows a lower N_H/A_K ratio
compared with the diffuse ISM.
