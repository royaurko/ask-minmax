Tree shape statistics quantify some aspect of the shape of a phylogenetic
tree. They are commonly used to compare reconstructed trees to evolutionary
models and to find evidence of tree reconstruction bias. Historically, to find
a useful tree shape statistic, formulas have been invented by hand and then
evaluated for utility. This article presents the first method which is capable
of optimizing over a class of tree shape statistics, called Binary Recursive
Tree Shape Statistics (BRTSS). After defining the BRTSS class, a set of
algebraic expressions is defined which can be used in the recursions. The tree
shape statistics definable using these expressions in the BRTSS is very
general, and includes many of the statistics with which phylogenetic
researchers are already familiar. We then present a practical genetic algorithm
which is capable of performing optimization over BRTSS given any objective
function. The chapter concludes with a successful application of the methods to
find a new statistic which indicates a significant difference between two
distributions on trees which were previously postulated to have similar
properties.
