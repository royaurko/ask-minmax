We present 30 new nearby (d<30 pc) red dwarf candidates, with estimated
spectral types M6 to M8. 26 were directly selected from the DENIS database, and
another 4 were first extracted from the LHS catalogue and cross-identified with
a DENIS counterpart. Their proper motions were measured on the MAMA measuring
machine from plates spanning 13 to 48 years, and are larger than 0.1 arcsec/yr,
ruling out the possibility that they are giants. Their distances were estimated
from the DENIS colours and IR colour-magnitude relations and range between 15
and 30 pc.
