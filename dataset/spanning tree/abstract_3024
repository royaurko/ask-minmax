We consider branching random walks built on Galton--Watson trees with
offspring distribution having a bounded support, conditioned to have $n$ nodes,
and their rescaled convergences to the Brownian snake. We exhibit a notion of
``globally centered discrete snake'' that extends the usual settings in which
the displacements are supposed centered. We show that under some additional
moment conditions, when $n$ goes to $+\infty$, ``globally centered discrete
snakes'' converge to the Brownian snake. The proof relies on a precise study of
the lineage of the nodes in a Galton--Watson tree conditioned by the size, and
their links with a multinomial process [the lineage of a node $u$ is the vector
indexed by $(k,j)$ giving the number of ancestors of $u$ having $k$ children
and for which $u$ is a descendant of the $j$th one]. Some consequences
concerning Galton--Watson trees conditioned by the size are also derived.
