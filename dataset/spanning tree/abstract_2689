We construct natural representations of the Connes-Kreimer Lie algebras on
rooted trees/Feynman graphs arising from Hecke correspondences in the
categories $\LRF, \LFG$ constructed by K. Kremnizer and the contributor. We thus
obtain the insertion/elimination representations constructed by Connes-Kreimer
as well as an isomorphic pair we term top-insertion/top-elimination. We also
construct graded finite-dimensional sub/quotient representations of these
arising from "truncated" correspondences.
