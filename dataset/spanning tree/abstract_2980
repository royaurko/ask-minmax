We study the phenomenology of new heavy vector-like fermions that couple to
the third generation quarks via Yukawa interactions, covering all the allowed
representations under the standard model gauge groups. We first review tree and
loop level bounds on these states. We then discuss tree level decays and
loop-induced decays to photon or gluon plus top. The main decays at tree level
are to W b and/or Z and Higgs plus top via the new Yukawa couplings. The
radiative loop decays turn out to be quite close to the naive estimate: in all
cases, in the allowed perturbative parameter space, the branching ratios are
mildly sensitive on the new Yukawa couplings and small. We therefore conclude
that the new states can be observed at the LHC and that the tree level decays
can allow to distinguish the different representations. Moreover, the
observation of the radiative decays at the LHC would suggest a large Yukawa
coupling in the non-perturbative regime.
