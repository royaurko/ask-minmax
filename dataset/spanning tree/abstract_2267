Erikkson showed that singular value decomposition(SVD) of flattenings
determined a partition of a phylogenetic tree to be a split. In this paper,
based on his work, we develop new statistically consistent algorithms fit for
grid computing to construct a phylogenetic tree by computing SVD of flattenings
with the small fixed number of rows.
