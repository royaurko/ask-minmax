We study the spanning properties of Theta-Theta graphs. Similar in spirit
with the Yao-Yao graphs, Theta-Theta graphs partition the space around each
vertex into a set of k cones, for some fixed integer k > 1, and select at most
one edge per cone. The difference is in the way edges are selected. Yao-Yao
graphs select an edge of minimum length, whereas Theta-Theta graphs select an
edge of minimum orthogonal projection onto the cone bisector. It has been
established that the Yao-Yao graphs with parameter k = 6k' have spanning ratio
11.67, for k' >= 6. In this paper we establish a first spanning ratio of $7.82$
for Theta-Theta graphs, for the same values of $k$. We also extend the class of
Theta-Theta spanners with parameter 6k', and establish a spanning ratio of
$16.76$ for k' >= 5. We surmise that these stronger results are mainly due to a
tighter analysis in this paper, rather than Theta-Theta being superior to
Yao-Yao as a spanner. We also show that the spanning ratio of Theta-Theta
graphs decreases to 4.64 as k' increases to 8. These are the first results on
the spanning properties of Theta-Theta graphs.
