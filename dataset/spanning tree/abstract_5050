An overview of advanced dynamical algorithms capable of spanning the widely
disparate time scales that govern the decay of metastable phases in discrete
spin models is presented. The algorithms discussed include constrained
transfer-matrix, Monte Carlo with Absorbing Markov Chains (MCAMC), and
projective dynamics (PD) methods. The strengths and weaknesses of each of these
algorithms are discussed, with particular emphasis on identifying the parameter
regimes (system size, temperature, and field) in which each algorithm works
best.
