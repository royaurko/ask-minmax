We present here the notion of breadth-first signature and its relationship
with numeration system theory. It is the serialisation into an infinite word of
an ordered infinite tree of finite degree. We study which class of languages
corresponds to which class of words and,more specifically, using a known
construction from numeration system theory, we prove that the signature of
rational languages are substitutive sequences.
