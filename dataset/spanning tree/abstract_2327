Recently, considerable effort has been put into developing fast algorithms to
reconstruct a rooted phylogenetic network that explains two rooted phylogenetic
trees and has a minimum number of hybridization vertices. With the standard
approach to tackle this problem being combinatorial, the reconstructed network
is rarely unique. From a biological point of view, it is therefore of
importance to not only compute one network, but all possible networks. In this
paper, we make a first step towards approaching this goal by presenting the
first algorithm---called allMAAFs---that calculates all
maximum-acyclic-agreement forests for two rooted binary phylogenetic trees on
the same set of taxa.
