Network-on-chip (NoC) is a new aspect for designing of future System-On-Chips
(SoC) where a vast number of IP cores are connected through interconnection
network. The communication between the nodes occurred by routing packets rather
than wires. It supports high degree of scalability, reusability and parallelism
in communication. In this paper, we present a Mesh routing architecture, which
is called Diametrical 2D Mesh of Tree, based on Mesh-of-Tree (MoT) routing and
Diametrical 2D Mesh. It has the advantage of having small diameter as well as
large bisection width and small node degree clubbed with being the fastest
network in terms of speed. The routing algorithm ensures that the packets will
always reach from source to sink through shortest path and is deadlock free.
