Representation of coalescent process using pruning of trees has been used by
Goldschmidt and Martin for the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent and by Abraham
and Delmas for the $\beta(3/2,1/2)$-coalescent. By considering a pruning
procedure on stable Galton-Watson tree with $n$ labeled leaves, we give a
representation of the discrete $\beta(1+\alpha,1-\alpha)$-coalescent, with
$\alpha\in [1/2,1)$ starting from the trivial partition of the $n$ first
integers. The construction can also be made directly on the stable continuum
L{\'e}vy tree, with parameter $1/\alpha$, simultaneously for all $n$. This
representation allows to use results on the asymptotic number of coalescence
events to get the asymptotic number of cuts in stable Galton-Watson tree (with
infinite variance for the reproduction law) needed to isolate the root. Using
convergence of the stable Galton-Watson tree conditioned to have infinitely
many leaves, one can get the asymptotic distribution of blocks in the last
coalescence event in the $\beta(1+\alpha,1-\alpha)$-coalescent.
