A graph is a $k$-leaf power of a tree $T$ if its vertices are leaves of $T$
and two vertices are adjacent in $T$ if and only if their distance in $T$ is at
most $k$. Then $T$ is a $k$-leaf root of $G$. This notion was introduced by
Nishimura, Ragde, and Thilikos [2002] motivated by the search for underlying
phylogenetic trees. We study here an extension of the $k$-leaf power graph
recognition problem. This extension is motivated by a new biological question
for the evaluation of the latteral gene transfer on a population of viruses. We
allow the host graph to slightly differs from a tree and allow some cycles. In
fact we study phylogenetic galled networks in which cycles are pairwise vertex
disjoint. We show some structural results and propose polynomial algorithms for
the cases $k=3$ and $k=4$. As a consequence, squares of galled networks can
also be recognized in polynomial time.
