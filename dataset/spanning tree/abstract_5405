We address an old (1977) conjecture of a subset of the contributors (a variant of
Ryser's conjecture): in every r-coloring of the edges of a biclique [A,B]
(complete bipartite graph), the vertex set can be covered by the vertices of at
most 2r-2 monochromatic connected components. We reduce this conjecture to
design-like conjectures, where the monochromatic components of the color
classes are bicliques [X,Y] with nonempty blocks X and Y. We prove this
conjecture for r<6.
  We show that the width (the number of bicliques) in every color class of any
spanning r-coloring is at most 2^{r-1} (and this is best possible).
