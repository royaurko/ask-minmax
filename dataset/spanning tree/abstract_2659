We show that every countable non-abelian free group $\Gamma $ admits a
spherically transitive action on a rooted tree $T$ such that the action of
$\Gamma $ on the boundary of $T$ is not essentially free. This reproves a
result of Bergeron and Gaboriau.
  The existence of such an action answers a question of Grigorchuk,
Nekrashevich and Sushchanskii.
