In this paper, we show that the failure of the unique branch hypothesis (UBH)
for tame trees (see \rdef{tame iteration tree}) implies that in some homogenous
generic extension of $V$ there is a transitive model $M$ containing $Ord \cup
\mathbb{R}$ such that $M\vDash AD^+ + \Theta > \theta_0$. In particular, this
implies the existence (in $V$) of a non-tame mouse. The results of this paper
significantly extend Steel's earlier results from \cite{steel2002core} for tame
trees.
