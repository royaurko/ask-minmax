Chemical tagging of stellar debris from disrupted open clusters and
associations underpins the science cases for next-generation multi-object
spectroscopic surveys. As part of the Galactic Archaeology project TraCD
(Tracking Cluster Debris), a preliminary attempt at reconstructing the birth
clouds of now phase-mixed thin disk debris is undertaken using a parametric
minimum spanning tree (MST) approach. Empirically-motivated chemical abundance
pattern uncertainties (for a 10-dimensional chemistry-space) are applied to
NBODY6-realised stellar associations dissolved into a background sea of field
stars, all evolving in a Milky Way potential. We demonstrate that significant
population reconstruction degeneracies appear when the abundance uncertainties
approach 0.1 dex and the parameterised MST approach is employed; more
sophisticated methodologies will be required to ameliorate these degeneracies.
