We perform a detailed semi-analytical analysis of the electroweak phase
transition (EWPT) property in NMSSM, which serves as a good benchmark model in
which the 126 GeV Higgs mixes with a singlet. In this case, a strongly first
order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) is achieved by the tree-level
effects and the phase transition strength $\gamma_c$ is determined by the vacua
energy gap at $T=0$. We make an anatomy of the energy gap at both tree-level
and loop-level and extract out a dimensionless phase transition parameter
$R_\kappa \equiv 4 \kappa v_s / A_\kappa$, which can replace $A_\kappa$ in the
parameterization and affect the light CP odd and even Higgs spectra. We find
that SFOEWPT only occurs in $R_\kappa \sim -1$ and positive $R_\kappa \lesssim
\mathcal{O}(10)$, which in the non-PQ limit case would prefer either a
relatively light CP odd or CP even Higgs boson $\sim (60, 100)$ GeV, therefore
serves as a smoking gun signal and requires new search strategies at the LHC.
