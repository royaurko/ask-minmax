Let T be a (not necessarily positive) weighted tree with n leaves numbered by
the set {1,...,n}. Define the k-weights of the tree D_{i_1,....,i_k}(T) as the
sum of the lengths of the edges of the minimal subtree connecting i_1,....,i_k.
We will call such numbers "k-weights" of the tree. In this paper, we
characterize the sets of real numbers indexed by the subsets of any cardinality
>= 2 of a n-set to be the weights of a tree with n leaves.
