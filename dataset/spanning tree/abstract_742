We investigated the network structures of the Japanese stock market through
the minimum spanning tree. We defined grouping coefficient to test the validity
of conventional grouping by industrial categories, and found a decreasing in
trend for the coefficient. This phenomenon supports the increasing external
influences on the market due to the globalization. To reduce this influence, we
used S&P500 index as the international market and removed its correlation with
every stock. We found stronger grouping in this measurement, compared to the
original analysis, which agrees with our assumption that the international
market influences to the Japanese market.
