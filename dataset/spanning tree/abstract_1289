To enable data aggregation among the event sources in wireless sensor
networks and to reduce the communication cost there is a need to establish a
coveraged tree structure inside any given event region to allow data reports to
be aggregated at a single processing point prior to transmission to the
network. In this paper we propose a novel technique to create one such tree
which maximizes the lifetime of the event sources while they are constantly
transmitting for data aggregation. We use the term Centralized Lifetime
Maximizing Tree (CLMT) to denote this tree. CLMT features with identification
of bottleneck node among the given set of nodes. This node collects the data
from every other node via routes with the highest branch energy subject to
condition loop is not created. By constructing tree in such a way, protocol is
able to reduce the frequency of tree reconstruction, minimize the delay and
maximize the functional lifetime of source nodes by minimizing the additional
energy involved in tree reconstruction.
