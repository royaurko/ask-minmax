In 1986 Goldman introduced a Lie algebra structure on the linear span L of
conjugacy classes of the fundamental group of a closed oriented surface. It is
easy to see that the class e_1 of the trivial loop is a central element in L.
We prove that any central element of L is a multiple of e_1 (a conjecture
communicated to the contributor by Chas and Sullivan), and moreover that any central
element of the Poisson algebra SL is a polynomial of e_1.
