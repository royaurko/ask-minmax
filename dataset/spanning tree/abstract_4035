The geometric median as well as the Frechet mean of points in an Hadamard
space are important in both theory and applications. Surprisingly, no
algorithms for their computation are hitherto known. To address this issue, we
use a split version of the proximal point algorithm for minimizing a sum of
convex functions and prove that this algorithm produces a sequence converging
to a minimizer of the objective function, which extends a recent result of D.
Bertsekas (2001) into Hadamard spaces. The method is quite robust and not only
does it yield algorithms for the median and the mean, but it also applies to
various other optimization problems. We moreover show that another algorithm
for computing the Frechet mean can be derived from the law of large numbers due
to K.-T. Sturm (2002). In applications, computing medians and means is probably
most needed in tree space, which is an instance of an Hadamard space, invented
by Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann (2001) as a tool for averaging phylogenetic
trees. It turns out, however, that it can be also used to model numerous other
tree-like structures. Since there now exists a polynomial-time algorithm for
computing geodesics in tree space due to M. Owen and S. Provan (2011), we
obtain efficient algorithms for computing medians and means, which can be
directly used in practice.
