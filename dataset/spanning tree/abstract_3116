Critical ideals of a graph are the determinantal ideals of the generalized
Laplacian matrix associated to it. In this paper we give an explicit
description of a set of generators of the critical ideals of a tree $T$, that
is, a simple connected graph without cycles. As a consequence we prove that the
only simple graph with $n$ vertices and $n-1$ trivial critical ideals is the
path with $n$ vertices. Also, we prove that if $T$ has $n$ vertices, then the
set of generates that we found is a Gro\"ebner basis for its $n-1$-critical
ideal. Moreover, we conjecture that is true for any of the critical ideals of
$T$. Using the description that we get of the critical ideals of a tree we
recovery some results obtained by Levine and Toumpakari about the critical
group of a wired regular tree.
