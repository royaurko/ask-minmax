We prove several criteria for quasi-isometry between non-locally-finite
graphs and their structure trees. Results of M\"oller in \cite{moeller92ends2}
for locally finite and transitive graphs are generalized. We also give a
criterion which describes quasi-isometry by how edge-ends are split up by the
cuts of a structure tree.
