We prove some asymptotic results for the radius and the profile of large
random rooted planar maps with faces of arbitrary degrees. Using a bijection
due to Bouttier, Di Francesco and Guitter between rooted planar maps and
certain four-type trees with positive labels, we derive our results from a
conditional limit theorem for four-type spatial Galton-Watson trees.
