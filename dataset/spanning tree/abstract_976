We show that the set of balanced binary trees is closed by interval in the
Tamari lattice. We establish that the intervals [T0, T1] where T0 and T1 are
balanced trees are isomorphic as posets to a hypercube. We introduce tree
patterns and synchronous grammars to get a functional equation of the
generating series enumerating balanced tree intervals.
