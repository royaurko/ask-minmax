In a graph, a spanning tree is said to be a tree t-spanner of the graph if
the distance between any two vertices in is at most times their distance in .
The tree t-spanner has many applications in networks and distributed
environments. In this paper, an algorithm is presented to find a tree -spanner
on trapezoid graphs in time, where is the number of vertices of the graph.
