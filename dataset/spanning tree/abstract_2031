Recently, we have shown that satisfiability for $\mathsf{ECTL}^*$ with
constraints over $\mathbb{Z}$ is decidable using a new technique. This approach
reduces the satisfiability problem of $\mathsf{ECTL}^*$ with constraints over
some structure A (or class of structures) to the problem whether A has a
certain model theoretic property that we called EHD (for "existence of
homomorphisms is decidable"). Here we apply this approach to concrete domains
that are tree-like and obtain several results. We show that satisfiability of
$\mathsf{ECTL}^*$ with constraints is decidable over (i) semi-linear orders
(i.e., tree-like structures where branches form arbitrary linear orders), (ii)
ordinal trees (semi-linear orders where the branches form ordinals), and (iii)
infinitely branching trees of height h for each fixed $h\in \mathbb{N}$. We
prove that all these classes of structures have the property EHD. In contrast,
we introduce Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse-games for $\mathsf{WMSO}+\mathsf{B}$ (weak
$\mathsf{MSO}$ with the bounding quantifier) and use them to show that the
infinite (order) tree does not have property EHD. As a consequence, a different
approach has to be taken in order to settle the question whether satisfiability
of $\mathsf{ECTL}^*$ (or even $\mathsf{LTL}$) with constraints over the
infinite (order) tree is decidable.
