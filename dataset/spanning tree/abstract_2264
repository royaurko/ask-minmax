In molecular phylogeny, relationships among organisms are reconstructed using
DNA or protein sequences and are displayed as trees. A linear increase in the
number of sequences results in an exponential increase of possible trees. Thus,
inferring trees from molecular data was shown to be NP-hard. This causes
problems, if large data sets are used. This review gives an introduction to
molecular phylogenetic methods and to the problems biologists are facing in
molecular phylogenetic analyses.
