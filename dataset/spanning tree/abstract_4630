Characters of rational vertex operator algebras (RVOAs) arising in
2-dimensional conformal field theories often belong (after suitable
normalization) to the (multiplicative) semigroup E^+ of modular units whose
Fourier expansions are in 1+q Z_{>=0}[[q]], up to a fractional power of q. If
even all characters of a RVOA share this property then we have an example of
what we call modular sets, i.e. finite subsets of E^+ whose elements
(additively) span a vector space which is invariant under the usual action of
SL(2,Z). The classification of modular sets and RVOAs seem to be closely
related. In this article we give an explicit description of the group of
modular units generated by E^+, we prove a certain finiteness result for
modular sets contained in a natural semi-subgroup E_* of E^+, and we discuss
consequences.
