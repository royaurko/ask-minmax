Classification is widely used technique in the data mining domain, where
scalability and efficiency are the immediate problems in classification
algorithms for large databases. We suggest improvements to the existing C4.5
decision tree algorithm. In this paper attribute oriented induction (AOI) and
relevance analysis are incorporated with concept hierarchys knowledge and
HeightBalancePriority algorithm for construction of decision tree along with
Multi level mining. The assignment of priorities to attributes is done by
evaluating information entropy, at different levels of abstraction for building
decision tree using HeightBalancePriority algorithm. Modified DMQL queries are
used to understand and explore the shortcomings of the decision trees generated
by C4.5 classifier for education dataset and the results are compared with the
proposed approach.
