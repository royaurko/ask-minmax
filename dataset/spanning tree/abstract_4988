The possibility that the magnetic field is strongly correlated with the
large-scale structure of the universe has been recently proposed in the
literature. In this scenario the intergalactic magnetic field has a strong (m
Gauss) regular component spanning tens of Mpc. This could have severe
consequences on the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays, and the
observed spectra, isotropy and composition. A quantitative discussion of these
effects is given in the present work.
