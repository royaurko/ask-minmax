A new construction is given of non-standard uniserial modules over certain
valuation domains; the construction resembles that of a special Aronszajn tree
in set theory. A consequence is the proof of a sufficient condition for the
existence of non-standard uniserial modules; this is a theorem of ZFC which
complements an earlier independence result.
