In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with bilinear R-parity
violation, only one neutrino eigenstate acquires a mass at tree level,
consequently experimental data on neutrinos cannot be accommodated at tree
level. We show that in the Next-to-Minimal extension, where a gauge singlet
superfield is added to primarily address the so-called $\mu$-problem, it is
possible to generate two massive neutrino states at tree level. Hence, the
global three-flavour neutrino data can be reproduced at tree level, without
appealing to loop dynamics which is vulnerable to model-dependent
uncertainties. We give analytical expressions for the neutrino mass eigenvalues
and present examples of realistic parameter choices.
