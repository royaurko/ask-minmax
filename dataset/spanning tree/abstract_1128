This paper presents two new deterministic algorithms for constructing
consensus trees. Given an input of k phylogenetic trees with identical leaf
label sets and n leaves each, the first algorithm constructs the majority rule
(+) consensus tree in O(kn) time, which is optimal since the input size is
Omega(kn), and the second one constructs the frequency difference consensus
tree in min(O(kn^2), O(kn (k+log^2 n))) time.
