The Small Subgraph Conditioning Method has been used to study the almost sure
existence and the asymptotic distribution of the number of regular spanning
subgraphs of various types in random \emph{d}-regular graphs. In this paper we
use the method to determine the asymptotic distribution of the number of 3-star
factors in random \emph{d}-regular graphs for $d \geq 4$
