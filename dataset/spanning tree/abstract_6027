This paper considers some work done by the contributor and Catlin [CD1,CD2,CD3]
concerning positivity conditions for bihomogeneous polynomials and metrics
on bundles over certain complex manifolds.  It presents a simpler proof of
a special case of the main result in [CD3], providing also a self-contained
proof of a generalization of the main result from [CD1].  Some new examples
and applications appear here as well.  The idea is to use the Bergman
kernel function and some operator theory to prove purely algebraic theorems
about matrices of polynomials.
  Theorem 1. [Catlin-D'Angelo]. Suppose that $f$ is a bihomogeneous
real-valued polynomial on ${\bf C^n}$ of degree $2m$.  Then $f$ is positive
away from the origin if and only there is an integer $d$ and a holomorphic
homogeneous polynomial mapping $A$, whose components span the space of
homogeneous polynomials of degree $m+d$, such that $$ ||z||^{2d}
f(z,{\overline z}) = ||A(z)||^2.$$ Suppose that $F(z,{\overline z})$ is an
$r$ by $r$ matrix whose entries are bihomogeneous polynomials of degree
$2m$.  Then $F(z,{\overline z})$ is positive-definite at each point $z \ne
0$ if and only if there is an integer $d$ and a holomorphic homogeneous
polynomial matrix $A$, whose row vectors span the space of $r$-tuples of
homogeneous polynomials of degree $m+d$, such that
  $$||z||^{2d} F(z,{\overline z}) = A(z)^* A(z).$$
