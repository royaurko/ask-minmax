The profusion of online news articles makes it difficult to find interesting
articles, a problem that can be assuaged by using a recommender system to bring
the most relevant news stories to readers. However, news recommendation is
challenging because the most relevant articles are often new content seen by
few users. In addition, they are subject to trends and preference changes over
time, and in many cases we do not have sufficient information to profile the
reader.
  In this paper, we introduce a class of news recommendation systems based on
context trees. They can provide high-quality news recommendation to anonymous
visitors based on present browsing behaviour. We show that context-tree
recommender systems provide good prediction accuracy and recommendation
novelty, and they are sufficiently flexible to capture the unique properties of
news articles.
