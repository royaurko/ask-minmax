A class of branching processes in varying environments is exhibited which
become extinct almost surely even though the means M_n grow fast enough so that
sum M_n^{-1} is finite. In fact, such a process is constructed for every
offspring distribution of infinite variance, and this establishes the converse
of a previously known fact: that if a distribution has finite variance then sum
M_n^{-1}=infty is equivalent to almost sure extinction. This has as an
immediate consequence the converse to a theorem on equipolarity of
Galton-Watson trees.
