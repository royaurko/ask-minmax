We consider quotients of complex Stiefel manifolds by finite cyclic groups
whose action is induced by the scalar multiplication on the corresponding
complex vector space. We obtain a description of their tangent bundles, compute
their mod p cohomology and obtain estimates for their span (with respect to
their standard differentiable structure). We compute the Pontrjagin and
Stiefel-Whitney classes of these manifolds and give applications to their
stable parallelizability.
