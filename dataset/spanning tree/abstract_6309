Let $f:\hat{C}\to\hat{C}$ be a subhyperbolic rational map of degree $d$. We
construct a set of coding maps $Cod(f)=\{\pi_r:\Sigma\to J\}_r$ of the Julia
set $J$ by geometric coding trees, where the parameter $r$ ranges over mappings
from a certain tree to the Riemann sphere. Using the universal covering space
$\phi:\tilde S\to S$ for the corresponding orbifold, we lift the inverse of $f$
to an iterated function system $I=(g_i)_{i=1,2,...,d}$. For the purpose of
studying the structure of $Cod(f)$, we generalize Kenyon and Lagarias-Wang's
results : If the attractor $K$ of $I$ has positive measure, then $K$ tiles
$\phi^{-1}(J)$, and the multiplicity of $\pi_r$ is well-defined. Moreover, we
see that the equivalence relation induced by $\pi_r$ is described by a finite
directed graph, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for two coding
maps $\pi_r$ and $\pi_{r'}$ to be equal.
