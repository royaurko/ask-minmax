We propose a statistical method to test whether two phylogenetic trees with
given alignments are significantly incongruent. Our method compares the two
distributions of phylogenetic trees given by the input alignments, instead of
comparing point estimations of trees. This statistical approach can be applied
to gene tree analysis for example, detecting unusual events in genome evolution
such as horizontal gene transfer and reshuffling. Our method uses difference of
means to compare two distributions of trees, after embedding trees in a vector
space. Bootstrapping alignment columns can then be applied to obtain p-values.
To compute distances between means, we employ a "kernel trick" which speeds up
distance calculations when trees are embedded in a high-dimensional feature
space, e.g. splits or quartets feature space. In this pilot study, first we
test our statistical method's ability to distinguish between sets of gene trees
generated under coalescence models with species trees of varying dissimilarity.
We follow our simulation results with applications to various data sets of
gophers and lice, grasses and their endophytes, and different fungal genes from
the same genome. A companion toolkit, {\tt Phylotree}, is provided to
facilitate computational experiments.
