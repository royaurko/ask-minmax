A b-coloring of a graph is a proper coloring such that every color class
contains a vertex that is adjacent to all other color classes. The b-chromatic
number of a graph G, denoted by \chi_b(G), is the maximum number t such that G
admits a b-coloring with t colors. A graph G is called b-continuous if it
admits a b-coloring with t colors, for every t = \chi(G),\ldots,\chi_b(G), and
b-monotonic if \chi_b(H_1) \geq \chi_b(H_2) for every induced subgraph H_1 of
G, and every induced subgraph H_2 of H_1.
  We investigate the b-chromatic number of graphs with stability number two.
These are exactly the complements of triangle-free graphs, thus including all
complements of bipartite graphs. The main results of this work are the
following:
  - We characterize the b-colorings of a graph with stability number two in
terms of matchings with no augmenting paths of length one or three. We derive
that graphs with stability number two are b-continuous and b-monotonic.
  - We prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether the b-chromatic number of
co-bipartite graph is at most a given threshold.
  - We describe a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm to compute the
b-chromatic number of co-trees.
  - Extending several previous results, we show that there is a polynomial time
dynamic programming algorithm for computing the b-chromatic number of
tree-cographs. Moreover, we show that tree-cographs are b-continuous and
b-monotonic.
