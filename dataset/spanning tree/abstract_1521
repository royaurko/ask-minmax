Annotated pushdown automata provide an automaton model of higher-order
recursion schemes, which may in turn be used to model higher-order programs for
the purposes of verification. We study Ground Annotated Stack Tree Rewrite
Systems -- a tree rewrite system where each node is labelled by the
configuration of an annotated pushdown automaton. This allows the modelling of
fork and join constructs in higher-order programs and is a generalisation of
higher-order stack trees recently introduced by Penelle.
  We show that, given a regular set of annotated stack trees, the set of trees
that can reach this set is also regular, and constructible in n-EXPTIME for an
order-n system, which is optimal. We also show that our construction can be
extended to allow a global state through which unrelated nodes of the tree may
communicate, provided the number of communications is subject to a fixed bound.
