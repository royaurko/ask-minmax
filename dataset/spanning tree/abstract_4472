We define a multi-type coalescent point process of a general branching
process with finitely many types. This multi-type coalescent fully describes
the genealogy of the (quasi-stationary) standing population, providing types
along ancestral lineages of all individuals in the standing population. We show
that this point-process is a functional of a certain Markov chain defined by
the planar embedding of the branching process. This Markov chain is further
used to determine statistical properties of the ancestral tree, such as the
time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of two consecutive individuals
in the standing population, as well as of two individuals of the same type.
These formulae are particularly simple for branching processes with a
multi-type linear-fractional (LF) offspring distribution. We illustrate their
use by showing how an (a)symmetrical offspring distribution affects features of
the ancestral tree in a two-type LF branching processes.
