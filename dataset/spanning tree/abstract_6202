We compare the effects of different quark diagram topologies on the weak
hadronic width of heavy-light mesons in the large N_c limit. We enumerate the
various topologies and show that the only one dominant (or even comparable) in
powers of N_c to the noninteracting spectator "tree" diagram is the
"annihilation" diagram, in which the valence quark-antiquark pair annihilate
weakly. We compute the amplitude for this diagram in the 't Hooft model (QCD in
1+1 spacetime dimensions with a large number of colors N_c) at the hadronic
level and compare to the Born term partonic level. We find that quark-hadron
duality is not well satisfied, even after the application of a smearing
procedure to the hadronic result. A number of interesting subtleties absent
from the tree diagram case arise in the annihilation diagram case, and are
described in detail.
