Invasion bond percolation (IBP) is mapped exactly into Prim's algorithm for
finding the shortest spanning tree of a weighted random graph. Exploring this
mapping, which is valid for arbitrary dimensions and lattices, we introduce a
new IBP model that belongs to the same universality class as IBP and generates
the minimal energy tree spanning the IBP cluster.
