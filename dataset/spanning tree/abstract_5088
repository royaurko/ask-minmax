This research analyzes complex networks in open-source software at the
inter-package level, where package dependencies often span across projects and
between development groups. We review complex networks identified at ``lower''
levels of abstraction, and then formulate a description of interacting software
components at the package level, a relatively ``high'' level of abstraction. By
mining open-source software repositories from two sources, we empirically show
that the coupling of modules at this granularity creates a small-world and
scale-free network in both instances.
