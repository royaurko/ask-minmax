This paper describes a relationship between essentially finite groupoids and
2-vector spaces. In particular, we show to construct 2-vector spaces of
Vect-valued presheaves on such groupoids. We define 2-linear maps corresponding
to functors between groupoids in both a covariant and contravariant way, which
are ambidextrous adjoints. This is used to construct a representation--a weak
functor--from Span(Gpd) (the bicategory of groupoids and spans of groupoids)
into 2Vect. In this paper we prove this and give the construction in detail.
