The subdivision graph $\mathcal{S}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph obtained
by inserting a new vertex into every edge of $G$. Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be two
vertex disjoint graphs. The \emph{subdivision-vertex corona} of $G_1$ and
$G_2$, denoted by $G_1\odot G_2$, is the graph obtained from $\mathcal{S}(G_1)$
and $|V(G_1)|$ copies of $G_2$, all vertex-disjoint, by joining the $i$th
vertex of $V(G_1)$ to every vertex in the $i$th copy of $G_2$. The
\emph{subdivision-edge corona} of $G_1$ and $G_2$, denoted by $G_1\circleddash
G_2$, is the graph obtained from $\mathcal{S}(G_1)$ and $|I(G_1)|$ copies of
$G_2$, all vertex-disjoint, by joining the $i$th vertex of $I(G_1)$ to every
vertex in the $i$th copy of $G_2$, where $I(G_1)$ is the set of inserted
vertices of $\mathcal{S}(G_1)$. In this paper we determine the adjacency
spectra, the Laplacian spectra and the signless Laplacian spectra of $G_1\odot
G_2$ (respectively, $G_1\circleddash G_2$) in terms of the corresponding
spectra of $G_1$ and $G_2$. As applications, the results on the spectra of
$G_1\odot G_2$ (respectively, $G_1\circleddash G_2$) enable us to construct
infinitely many pairs of cospectral graphs. The adjacency spectra of $G_1\odot
G_2$ (respectively, $G_1\circleddash G_2$) help us to construct many infinite
families of integral graphs. By using the Laplacian spectra, we also obtain the
number of spanning trees and Kirchhoff index of $G_1\odot G_2$ and
$G_1\circleddash G_2$, respectively.
