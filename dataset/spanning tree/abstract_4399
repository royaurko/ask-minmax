Neutrino mass patterns and mixing have been studied in the context of
next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) with three gauge singlet
neutrino superfields. We consider the case with the assumption of R-parity
conservation. The vacuum expectation value of the singlet scalar field $S$ of
NMSSM induces the Majorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos as well as the
usual $\mu$-term. The contributions to the light neutrino mass matrix at the
tree level as well as one-loop level are considered, consistent with the
tri-bimaximal pattern of neutrino mixing. Light neutrino masses arise at the
tree level through a TeV scale seesaw mechanism involving the right-handed
neutrinos. Although all the three light neutrinos acquire non-zero masses at
the tree-level, we show that the one-loop contributions can be comparable in
size under certain conditions.
