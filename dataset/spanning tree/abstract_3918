We study the problem of eliminating recursion from monadic datalog programs
on trees with an infinite set of labels. We show that the boundedness problem,
i.e., determining whether a datalog program is equivalent to some nonrecursive
one is undecidable but the decidability is regained if the descendant relation
is disallowed. Under similar restrictions we obtain decidability of the problem
of equivalence to a given nonrecursive program. We investigate the connection
between these two problems in more detail.
