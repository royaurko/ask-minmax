We first show that increasing trees are in bijection with set compositions,
extending simultaneously a recent result on trees due to Tonks and a classical
result on increasing binary trees. We then consider algebraic structures on the
linear span of set compositions (the twisted descent algebra). Among others, a
number of enveloping algebra structures are introduced and studied in detail.
For example, it is shown that the linear span of trees carries an enveloping
algebra structure and embeds as such in an enveloping algebra of increasing
trees. All our constructions arise naturally from the general theory of twisted
Hopf algebras.
