We call a finitely complete category diexact if every Mal'cev relation admits
a pushout which is stable under pullback and itself a pullback. We prove three
results relating to diexact categories: firstly, that a category is a pretopos
if and only if it is diexact with a strict initial object; secondly, that a
category is diexact if and only if it is Barr-exact, and every pair of
monomorphisms admits a pushout which is stable and a pullback; and thirdly,
that a small category with finite limits and pushouts of Mal'cev spans is
diexact if and only if it admits a full structure-preserving embedding into a
Grothendieck topos.
