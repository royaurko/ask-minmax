We study a variation of Mumford's quotient for the action of a maximal torus
$T$ on a flag variety $G/B$ depending on projective embedding $G/B
\hookrightarrow \Bbb P(V(\chi))$, where $T$-linearization is induced by the
standard $G$-linearization. We describe the linear spans of the supports of
semistable orbits, that allow us to calculate the rank of the Picard group of
quotient $(G/B)^{ss}//T$, when $G$ does not contain simple factors of type
$A_n$.
