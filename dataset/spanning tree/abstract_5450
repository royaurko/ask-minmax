The time-dependent probability distribution function of the height for the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation with sharp wedge initial conditions has been
obtained recently as a convolution between the Gumbel distribution and a
difference of two Fredholm determinants. We evaluate numerically this
distribution over the whole time span. The crossover from the short time
behavior, which is Gaussian, to the long time behavior, which is governed by
the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution, is clearly visible.
