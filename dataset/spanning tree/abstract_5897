We analyze the WW scattering in scenarios of dynamical electroweak symmetry
breaking of walking technicolor type. We show that in these theories there are
regions of the parameters space allowed by the electroweak precision data, in
which unitarity violation is delayed at tree level up to around 3-4 TeV without
the inclusion of any sub-TeV resonances.
