In this note, we prove optimal extension results for roughly isometric
relations between metric (R-)trees and injective metric spaces. This yields
sharp stability estimates, in terms of the Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) distance, for
certain metric spanning constructions: The GH distance of two metric trees
spanned by some subsets is smaller than or equal to the GH distance of these
sets. The GH distance of the injective hulls, or tight spans, of two metric
spaces is at most twice the GH distance between themselves.
