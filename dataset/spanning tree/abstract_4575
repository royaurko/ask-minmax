In this paper, we study the single and double soft behaviors of tree level
off-shell currents and on-shell amplitudes in nonlinear sigma model(NLSM). We
first propose and prove the leading soft behavior of the tree level currents
with a single soft particle. In the on-shell limit, this single soft emission
becomes the Adler's zero. Then we establish the leading and sub-leading soft
behaviors of tree level currents with two adjacent soft particles. With a
careful analysis of the on-shell limit, we obtain the double soft behaviors of
on-shell amplitudes where the two soft particles are adjacent to each other. By
applying Kleiss-Kuijf (KK) relation, we further obtain the leading and
sub-leading behaviors of amplitudes with two nonadjacent soft particles.
