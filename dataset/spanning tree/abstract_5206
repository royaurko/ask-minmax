When the Hamiltonian of a system is represented by a finite matrix,
constructed from a discrete basis, the matrix representation of the resolvent
covers only one branch. We show how all branches can be specified by the phase
of a complex unit of time. This permits the Hamiltonian matrix to be
constructed on a real basis; the only duty of the basis is to span the
dynamical region of space, without regard for the particular asymptotic
boundary conditions that pertain to the problem of interest.
