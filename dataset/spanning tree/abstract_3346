We provide a new extension of entanglement witnesses for
$\mathbb{C}^{d_{1}}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d_{2}}$ systems. Our construction
preserves the properties of indecomposability and spanning property of
entanglement witnesses. We show how our concept of extended entanglement
witnesses is connected with the idea of measurement device independent
entanglement witnesses.
