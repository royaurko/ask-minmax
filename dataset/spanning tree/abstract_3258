We present an atlas of 129 spectral energy distributions for nearby galaxies,
with wavelength coverage spanning from the UV to the mid-infrared. Our atlas
spans a broad range of galaxy types, including ellipticals, spirals, merging
galaxies, blue compact dwarfs and luminous infrared galaxies. We have combined
ground-based optical drift-scan spectrophotometry with infrared spectroscopy
from Spitzer and Akari, with gaps in spectral coverage being filled using
MAGPHYS spectral energy distribution models. The spectroscopy and models were
normalized, constrained and verified with matched-aperture photometry measured
from Swift, GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, Spitzer and WISE images. The availability of 26
photometric bands allowed us to identify and mitigate systematic errors present
in the data. Comparison of our spectral energy distributions with other
template libraries and the observed colors of galaxies indicates that we have
smaller systematic errors than existing atlases, while spanning a broader range
of galaxy types. Relative to the prior literature, our atlas will provide
improved K-corrections, photometric redshifts and star-formation rate
calibrations.
