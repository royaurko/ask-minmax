We study certain consistent families $(F_\lambda)_{\lambda\ge 0}$ of
Galton-Watson forests with lifetimes as edge lengths and/or immigrants as
progenitors of the trees in $F_\lambda$. Specifically, consistency here refers
to the property that for each $\mu\le\lambda$, the forest $F_\mu$ has the same
distribution as the subforest of $F_\lambda$ spanned by the black leaves in a
Bernoulli leaf colouring, where each leaf of $F_\lambda$ is coloured in black
independently with probability $\mu/\lambda$. The case of exponentially
distributed lifetimes and no immigration was studied by Duquesne and Winkel and
related to the genealogy of Markovian continuous-state branching processes. We
characterise here such families in the framework of arbitrary lifetime
distributions and immigration according to a renewal process, related to
Sagitov's (non-Markovian) generalisation of continuous-state branching renewal
processes, and similar processes with immigration.
