We experimentally and numerically study dispersive wave emission, soliton
fission and supercontinuum generation in a silicon wire at telecommunication
wavelengths. Through dispersion engineering, we experimentally confirm a
previously reported numerical study [1] and show that the emission of resonant
radiation from the solitons can lead to the generation of a supercontinuum
spanning over 500 nm. An excellent agreement with numerical simulations is
observed.
