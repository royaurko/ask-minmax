The election is a classical problem in distributed algorithmic. It aims to
design and to analyze a distributed algorithm choosing a node in a graph, here,
in a tree. In this paper, a class of randomized algorithms for the election is
studied. The election amounts to removing leaves one by one until the tree is
reduced to a unique node which is then elected. The algorithm assigns to each
leaf a probability distribution (that may depends on the information
transmitted by the eliminated nodes) used by the leaf to generate its remaining
random lifetime. In the general case, the probability of each node to be
elected is given. For two categories of algorithms, close formulas are
provided.
