In this paper we show that graphs of "neighbourly" cubical complexes --
cubical complexes in which every pair of vertices spans a (unique) cube -- have
good expansion properties, using a technique based on multicommodity flows. By
showing that graphs of stable set polytopes are graphs of neighbourly cubical
complexes we give a new proof that graphs of stable set polytopes have edge
expansion 1.
