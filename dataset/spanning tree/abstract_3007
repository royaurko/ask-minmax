We present a binary routing tree protocol for distributed hash table
overlays. Using this protocol each peer can independently route messages to its
parent and two descendants on the fly without any maintenance, global context,
and synchronization. The protocol is then extended to support tree change
notification with similar efficiency. The resulting tree is almost perfectly
dense and balanced, and has O(1) stretch if the distributed hash table is
symmetric Chord. We use the tree routing protocol to overcome the main
impediment for implementation of local thresholding algorithms in peer-to-peer
systems -- their requirement for cycle free routing. Direct comparison of a
gossip-based algorithm and a corresponding local thresholding algorithm on a
majority voting problem reveals that the latter obtains superior accuracy using
a fraction of the communication overhead.
