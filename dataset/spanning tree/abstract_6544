We compute the present-day Wino dark matter annihilation cross-section
including the one-loop radiative corrections together with the fully treated
electroweak Sommerfeld effect. We discuss what is the consistent way of
incorporating these two corrections simultaneously and why simply using the
running coupling constants values at the Wino mass scale is not correct. The
results show that up to a few TeV scale the full one-loop computation makes the
cross-section smaller up to about 30% with respect to the Sommerfeld enhanced
tree level result and are considerably larger than the tree or one-loop level
without the Sommerfeld effect.
