The broadband, coherent nature of narrow-linewidth fiber frequency combs is
exploited to measure the full complex spectrum of a molecular gas through
multi-heterodyne spectroscopy. We measure the absorption and phase shift
experienced by each of 155,000 individual frequency comb lines, spaced by 100
MHz and spanning from 1495 nm to 1620 nm, after passing through a hydrogen
cyanide gas. The measured phase spectrum agrees with Kramers-Kronig
transformation of the absorption spectrum. This technique can provide a full
complex spectrum rapidly, over wide bandwidths, and with hertz-level accuracy.
