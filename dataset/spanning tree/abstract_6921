In this paper, we introduce a new sparse signal recovery algorithm, referred
to as sparse Kalman tree search (sKTS), that provides a robust reconstruction
of the sparse vector from the sequence of correlated observation vectors. The
proposed sKTS algorithm builds on expectation-maximization algorithm and
consists of two main operations: 1) Kalman smoothing for obtaining the a
posteriori statistics of the source signal vectors and 2) identification of the
support of the signal vectors via greedy tree search algorithm. The performance
of the sKTS algorithm is evaluated in the context of sparse channel estimation
for wireless communications. Through computer simulations, we demonstrate that
sKTS outperforms conventional sparse recovery algorithms and also performs
close to the Oracle (genie-based) Kalman estimator.
