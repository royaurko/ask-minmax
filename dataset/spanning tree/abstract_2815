We prove that if $X$ is a complex strictly monotone sequence space with
$1$-unconditional basis, $Y \subseteq X$ has no bands isometric to $\ell_2^2$
and $Y$ is the range of norm-one projection from $X$, then $Y$ is a closed
linear span a family of mutually disjoint vectors in $X$.
  We completely characterize $1$-complemented subspaces and norm-one
projections in complex spaces $\ell_p(\ell_q)$ for $1 \leq p, q < \infty$.
  Finally we give a full description of the subspaces that are spanned by a
family of disjointly supported vectors and which are $1$-complemented in (real
or complex) Orlicz or Lorentz sequence spaces. In particular if an Orlicz or
Lorentz space $X$ is not isomorphic to $\ell_p$ for some $1 \leq p < \infty$
then the only subspaces of $X$ which are $1$-complemented and disjointly
supported are the closed linear spans of block bases with constant
coefficients.
