We compute the virtual cohomological dimension (VCD) of the group of
partially symmetric outer automorphisms of a free group. We use this to obtain
new upper and lower bounds on the VCD of the outer automorphism group of a
two-dimensional right-angled Artin group. In the case of a right-angled group
with defining graph a tree, the bounds agree.
