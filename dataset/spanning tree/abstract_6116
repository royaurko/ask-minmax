We investigate the effect of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) on the
density profiles of $V_{\rm max} \simeq 40~km~s^{-1}$ isolated dwarf dark
matter halos -- the scale of relevance for the too big to fail problem (TBTF)
-- using very high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations. Each halo has
millions of particles within its virial radius. We find that SIDM models with
cross sections per unit mass spanning the range \sigma/m = $0.5 - 50$
$cm^2~g^{-1}$ alleviate TBTF and produce constant density cores of size
300-1000 pc, comparable to the half-light radii of $M_\star$ ~ $10^{5-7}$
$M_\odot$ dwarfs. The largest, lowest density cores develop for cross sections
in the middle of this range, \sigma/m ~ $5-10~cm^2~g^{-1}$. Our largest SIDM
cross section run (\sigma/m = $50~cm^2~g^{-1}$) develops a slightly denser core
owing to mild core-collapse behavior, but it remains less dense than the CDM
case and retains a constant density core profile. Our work suggests that SIDM
cross sections as large or larger than $50~cm^2~g^{-1}$ remain viable on
velocity scales of dwarf galaxies ($v_{\rm rms}$ ~ $40~km~s^{-1}$). The range
of SIDM cross sections that alleviate TBTF and the cusp/core problem spans at
least two orders of magnitude and therefore need not be particularly
fine-tuned.
