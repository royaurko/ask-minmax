We define new families of noncommutative symmetric functions and
quasi-symmetric functions depending on two matrices of parameters, and more
generally on parameters associated with paths in a binary tree. Appropriate
specializations of both matrices then give back the two-vector families of
Hivert, Lascoux, and Thibon and the noncommutative Macdonald functions of
Bergeron and Zabrocki.
