For a fixed digraph $\mathbb H$, the $\mathbb H$-coloring problem is the
problem of deciding whether a given input digraph $\mathbb G$ admits a
homomorphism to $\mathbb H$. The CSP dichotomy conjecture of Feder and Vardi is
equivalent to proving that, for any $\mathbb H$, the $\mathbb H$-coloring
problem is in in P or NP-complete. We confirm this dichotomy for a certain
class of oriented trees, which we call special trees (generalizing earlier
results on special triads and polyads). Moreover, we prove that every tractable
special oriented tree has bounded width, i.e., the corresponding $\mathbb
H$-coloring problem is solvable by local consistency checking. Our proof relies
on recent algebraic tools, namely characterization of congruence
meet-semidistributivity via pointing operations and absorption theory.
