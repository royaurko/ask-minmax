We report the infrared (IR) response of Cu-O chains in the high-$T_{c}$
superconductor YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{y}$ over the doping range spanning $%
y=6.28-6.75$. We find evidence for a power law scaling at mid-IR frequencies
consistent with predictions for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, thus supporting the
notion of one-dimensional transport in the chains. We analyze the role of
coupling to the CuO$_{2}$ planes in establishing metallicity and
superconductivity in disordered chain fragments.
