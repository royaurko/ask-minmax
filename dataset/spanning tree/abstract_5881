We prove simplicity for incomplete rank 2 Kac-Moody groups over algebraic
closures of finite fields with trivial commutation relations between root
groups corresponding to prenilpotent pairs. We don't use the (yet unknown)
simplicity of the corresponding finitely generated groups (i.e., when the
ground field is finite). Nevertheless we use the fact that the latter groups
are just infinite (modulo center).
