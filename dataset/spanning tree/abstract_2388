The BCFW recursion relation allows to find out the tree-level scattering
amplitudes for gluons and tensor gauge bosons in generalized Yang-Mills theory.
We demonstrate that the corresponding MHV amplitudes for the tensor gauge
bosons of spin-s and n gluons are invariant under conformal group
transformations. We discuss and compare the tree-level scattering amplitudes
for the charged tensor bosons with the corresponding scattering amplitudes for
gravitons, stressing their differences and similarities.
