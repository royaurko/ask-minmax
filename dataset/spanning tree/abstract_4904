We study the Minimum Latency Submodular Cover problem (MLSC), which consists
of a metric $(V,d)$ with source $r\in V$ and $m$ monotone submodular functions
$f_1, f_2, ..., f_m: 2^V \rightarrow [0,1]$. The goal is to find a path
originating at $r$ that minimizes the total cover time of all functions. This
generalizes well-studied problems, such as Submodular Ranking [AzarG11] and
Group Steiner Tree [GKR00]. We give a polynomial time $O(\log \frac{1}{\eps}
\cdot \log^{2+\delta} |V|)$-approximation algorithm for MLSC, where
$\epsilon>0$ is the smallest non-zero marginal increase of any
$\{f_i\}_{i=1}^m$ and $\delta>0$ is any constant.
  We also consider the Latency Covering Steiner Tree problem (LCST), which is
the special case of \mlsc where the $f_i$s are multi-coverage functions. This
is a common generalization of the Latency Group Steiner Tree
[GuptaNR10a,ChakrabartyS11] and Generalized Min-sum Set Cover [AzarGY09,
BansalGK10] problems. We obtain an $O(\log^2|V|)$-approximation algorithm for
LCST.
  Finally we study a natural stochastic extension of the Submodular Ranking
problem, and obtain an adaptive algorithm with an $O(\log 1/ \eps)$
approximation ratio, which is best possible. This result also generalizes some
previously studied stochastic optimization problems, such as Stochastic Set
Cover [GoemansV06] and Shared Filter Evaluation [MunagalaSW07, LiuPRY08].
