This is the last paper of a series of four papers in which we prove the
following relaxation of the Loebl-Komlos-Sos Conjecture: For every $\alpha>0$
there exists a number~$k_0$ such that for every $k>k_0$ every $n$-vertex graph
$G$ with at least $(\frac12+\alpha)n$ vertices of degree at least $(1+\alpha)k$
contains each tree $T$ of order $k$ as a subgraph.
  In the first two papers of this series, we decomposed the host graph $G$, and
found a suitable combinatorial structure inside the decomposition. In the third
paper, we refined this structure, and proved that any graph satisfying the
conditions of the above approximate version of the Loebl-Komlos-Sos Conjecture
contains one of ten specific configurations. In this paper we embed the tree
$T$ in each of the ten configurations.
