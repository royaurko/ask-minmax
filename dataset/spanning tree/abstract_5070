We consider two different systems exhibiting a continuous phase transition
into an absorbing state. Both models belong to the same universality class,
i.e., they are characterized by the same scaling functions and the same
critical exponents. Varying the range of interactions we examine the crossover
from the mean-field-like to the non-mean-field scaling behavior. A
phenomenological scaling form is applied in order to describe the full
crossover region which spans several decades. Our results strongly supports the
hypotheses that the crossover function is universal.
