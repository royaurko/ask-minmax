Xu introduced a family of root-tree-diagram nilpotent Lie algebras of
differential operators, in connection with evolution partial differential
equations. We generalized his notion to more general oriented tree diagrams.
These algebras are natural analogues of the maximal nilpotent Lie subalgebras
of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. In this paper, we use Hodge
Laplacian to study the cohomology of these Lie algebras. The "total rank
conjecture" and "$b_2$-conjecture" for the algebras are proved. Moreover, we
find the generating functions of the Betti numbers by means of Young tableaux
for the Lie algebras associated with certain tree diagrams of single branch
point. By these functions and Euler-Poincare principle, we obtain analogues of
the denominator identity for finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. The result
is a natural generalization of the Bott's classical result in the case of
special linear Lie algebras.
