Let $T$ be an infinite rooted tree with weights $w_e$ assigned to its edges.
Denote by $m_n(T)$ the minimum weight of a path from the root to a node of the
$n$th generation. We consider the possible behaviour of $m_n(T)$ with focus on
the two following cases: we say $T$ is explosive if \[ \lim_{n\to \infty}m_n(T)
< \infty, \] and say that $T$ exhibits linear growth if \[ \liminf_{n\to
\infty} \frac{m_n(T)}{n} > 0. \]
  We consider a class of infinite randomly weighted trees related to the
Poisson-weighted infinite tree, and determine precisely which trees in this
class have linear growth almost surely. We then apply this characterization to
obtain new results concerning the event of explosion in infinite randomly
weighted spherically-symmetric trees, answering a question of Pemantle and
Peres. As a further application, we consider the random real tree generated by
attaching sticks of deterministic decreasing lengths, and determine for which
sequences of lengths the tree has finite height almost surely.
