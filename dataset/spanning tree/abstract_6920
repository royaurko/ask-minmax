A generalisation of the narrow-width approximation (NWA) is formulated which
allows for a consistent treatment of interference effects between nearly
mass-degenerate particles in the factorisation of a more complicated process
into production and decay parts. It is demonstrated that interference effects
of this kind arising in BSM models can be very large, leading to drastic
modifications of predictions based on the standard NWA. The application of the
generalised NWA is demonstrated both at tree level and at one-loop order for an
example process where the neutral Higgs bosons $h$ and $H$ of the MSSM are
produced in the decay of a heavy neutralino and subsequently decay into a
fermion pair. The generalised NWA, based on on-shell matrix elements or their
approximations leading to simple weight factors, is shown to produce UV- and
IR-finite results which are numerically close to the result of the full process
at tree level and at one-loop order, where an agreement of better than $1\%$ is
found for the considered process. The most accurate prediction for this process
based on the generalised NWA, taking into account also corrections that are
formally of higher orders, is briefly discussed.
