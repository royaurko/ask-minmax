Thomas proved that every undirected graph admits a linked tree decomposition
of width equal to its treewidth. In this paper, we generalize Thomas's theorem
to digraphs. We prove that every digraph G admits a linked directed path
decomposition and a linked DAG decomposition of width equal to its directed
pathwidth and DAG-width respectively.
