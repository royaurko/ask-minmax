We are interested in characterising pairs $S,T$ of $F$-linear subspaces in a
field extension $L/F$ such that the linear span $ST$ of the set of products of
elements of $S$ and of elements of $T$ has small dimension. Our central result
is a linear analogue of Vosper's Theorem, which gives the structure of vector
spaces $S,T$ in a prime extension $L$ of a finite field $F$ for which
$\dim_F(ST) =\dim_F(S)+\dim_F(T)-1$, when $\dim_F(S), \dim_F(T) >1$ and
$\dim_F(ST) < [L:F]-1$.
