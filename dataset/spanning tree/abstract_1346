We show that the class of finite rooted binary plane trees is a Ramsey class
(with respect to topological embeddings that map leaves to leaves). That is,
for all such trees P,H and every natural number k there exists a tree T such
that for every k-coloring of the (topological) copies of P in T there exists a
(topological) copy H' of H in T such that all copies of P in H' have the same
color. When the trees are represented by the so-called rooted triple relation,
the result gives rise to a Ramsey class of relational structures with respect
to induced substructures.
