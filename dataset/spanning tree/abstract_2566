One of the interesting problems on optimal indecomposable entanglement
witnesses is whether there exists an optimal indecomposable witness which
neither has the spanning property nor is associated with extremal positive
linear map. Here, we answer this question negatively by examining the
extremality of the positive linear maps constructed by Qi and Hou [J. Phys. A
{\bf 44}, 215305 (2100)].
