In this article we consider several probabilistic processes defining random
grapha. One of these processes appeared recently in connection with a
factorization problem in the symmetric group. For each of the probabilistic
processes, we prove that the probability for the random graph to be a tree has
an extremely simple expression, which is independent of most parameters of the
problem. This raises many open questions.
