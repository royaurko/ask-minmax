Consider a random walk in random environment on a supercritical
Galton--Watson tree, and let $\tau_n$ be the hitting time of generation $n$.
The paper presents a large deviation principle for $\tau_n/n$, both in quenched
and annealed cases. Then we investigate the subexponential situation, revealing
a polynomial regime similar to the one encountered in one dimension. The paper
heavily relies on estimates on the tail distribution of the first regeneration
time.
