We study the dependence of the dimensional character of the charge-density
wave (CDW) in TiSe2 by a controlled variation of the number of available charge
carriers in the conduction band. A change of dimensionality is realised by H2O
exposure and monitored by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. The CDW
spanning vector changes from 2x2x1 towards 1x1x2 in a narrow population range,
just before a complete suppression of the CDW. Our findings enable a new view
on the excitonic origin of the CDW, the relation between CDW spanning vector
and periodic lattice distortion, and suggest modifications in the picture of
the recently discovered chirality of the CDW.
