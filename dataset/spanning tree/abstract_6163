We study the long-time dynamics of a forest-fire model with deterministic
tree growth and instantaneous burning of entire forests by stochastic lightning
strikes. Asymptotically the system organizes into a coarsening self-similar
mosaic of synchronized patches within which trees regrow and burn
simultaneously. We show that the average patch length <L> grows linearly with
time as t-->oo. The number density of patches of length L, N(L,t), scales as
<L>^{-2}M(L/<L>), and within a mean-field rate equation description we find
that this scaling function decays as e^{-1/x} for x-->0, and as e^{-x} for
x-->oo. In one dimension, we develop an event-driven cluster algorithm to study
the asymptotic behavior of large systems. Our numerical results are consistent
with mean-field predictions for patch coarsening.
