In this paper we show that during an elementary extension of a context each
of the classification trees of the newly created box extent lattice can be
obtained by the modification of the classification trees of the box extent
lattice of the original, smaller context. We construct also an algorithm which,
starting from a classification tree of the box extent lattice of the smaller
context $(H,M,I\cap H\times M),$ gives a classification tree of the extended
context $(G,M,I)$ which contains the new elements inserted. The effectiveness
of the method is that it ensures that there is enough to know the original
context, the classification tree of the box extent lattice and its box extents,
we do not need a new box extension of the extended context mesh elements
(except for one, which is the new element box extension).
