The Bost conjecture with C*-algebra coefficients for locally compact
Hausdorff groups passes to open subgroups. We also prove that if a locally
compact Hausdorff group acts on a tree, then the Bost conjecture with
C*-coefficients is true for the group if and only if it is true for the
stabilisers of the vertices.
