We prove almost sure convergence of the maximum degree in an evolving tree
model combining local choice and preferential attachment. At each step in the
growth of the graph, a new vertex is introduced. A fixed, finite number of
possible neighbors are sampled from the existing vertices with probability
proportional to degree. Of these possibilities, the vertex with the largest
degree is chosen. The maximal degree in this model has linear or near-linear
behavior. This contrasts sharply with what is seen in the same choice model
without preferential attachment. The proof is based showing the tree has a
persistent hub by comparison with the standard preferential attachment model,
as well as martingale and random walk arguments.
