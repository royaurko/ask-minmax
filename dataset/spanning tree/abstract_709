We presented the results of several statistical tests of the randomness in
the angular sky-distribution of gamma-ray bursts in BATSE Catalog. Thirteen
different tests were presented based on Voronoi tesselation, Minimal spanning
tree and Multifractal spectrum for five classes (short1, short2, intermediate,
long1, long2) of gamma-ray bursts, separately. The long1 and long2 classes are
distributed randomly. The intermediate subclass, in accordance with the earlier
results of the contributors, is distributed non-randomly. Concerning the short
subclass earlier statistical tests also suggested some departure from the
random distribution, but not on a high enough confidence level. The new tests
presented in this article suggest also non-randomness here.
