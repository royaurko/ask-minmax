This paper gives a first step toward extending the theory of
Fourier-Stieltjes algebras from groups to groupoids. If G is a locally compact
(second countable) groupoid, we show that B(G), the linear span of the Borel
positive definite functions on G, is a Banach algebra when represented as an
algebra of completely bounded maps on a C^*-algebra associated with G. This
necessarily involves identifying equivalent elements of B(G). An example shows
that the linear span of the continuous positive definite functions need not be
complete. For groups, B(G) is isometric to the Banach space dual of C^*(G).
For groupoids, the best analog of that fact is to be found in a representation
of B(G) as a Banach space of completely bounded maps from a C^*-algebra
associated with G to a C^*-algebra associated with the equivalence relation
induced by G. This paper adds weight to the clues in the earlier study of
Fourier-Stieltjes algebras that there is a much more general kind of duality
for Banach algebras waiting to be explored.
