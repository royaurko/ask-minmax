We report point contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) spectroscopy studies on
Ni3Al with composition range (24, 26 and 27 at. % of Al in the solid solution)
spanning the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase boundary. PCAR studies
performed using Nb tip as counter electrode reveal that the superconducting
quasiparticle lifetime (\tao) and superconducting energy gap (\delta) decreases
with increasing spin fluctuation in the normal metal electrode. Our study
reveals that PCAR could be a useful probe to study spin fluctuations in systems
which are on the verge of a magnetic instability.
