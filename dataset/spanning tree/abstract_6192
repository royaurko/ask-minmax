We have investigated some phenomenological aspects of an $SU(2)\times U(1)$
scenario where scalars belonging to arbitrary representations of $SU(2)$ are
involved in electroweak symmetry breaking. The resulting interaction terms are
derived. Some constraints are obtained on the arbitrary scalar sector from the
requirement of tree-level unitarity in longitudinal gauge boson scattering. We
also show that, in cases where the scalars ensure $\rho=1$ at tree-level,
useful restrictions on their parameter space follow from precision measurements
of the $Zb\bar b$ vertex. Finally, some salient features about the production
of such Higgs bosons in $e^+e^-$ collision are discussed.
