We study the Partial Degree Bounded Edge Packing (PDBEP) problem introduced
in [5] by Zhang. They have shown that this problem is NP-Hard even for uniform
degree constraint. They also presented approximation algorithms for the case
when all the vertices have degree constraint of 1 and 2 with approximation
ratio of 2 and 32=11 respectively. In this work we study general degree
constraint case (arbitrary degree constraint for each vertex) and present two
combinatorial approximation algorithms with approximation factors 4 and 2. We
also study integer program based solution and present an iterative rounding
algorithm with approximation factor 3/(1 - \epsilon)^2 for any positive
\epsilon. Next we study the same problem with weighted edges. In this case we
present an O(log n) approximation algorithm. Zhang has given an exact O(n^2)
complexity algorithm for trees in case of uniform degree constraint. We improve
their result by giving O(nlog n) complexity exact algorithm for trees with
general degree constraint.
