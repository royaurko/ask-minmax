For planar landmark based shapes, taking into account the non-Euclidean
geometry of the shape space, a statistical test for a common mean first
geodesic principal component (GPC) is devised. It rests on one of two
asymptotic scenarios, both of which are identical in a Euclidean geometry. For
both scenarios, strong consistency and central limit theorems are established,
along with an algorithm for the computation of a Ziezold mean geodesic. In
application, this allows to verify the geodesic hypothesis for leaf growth of
Canadian black poplars and to discriminate genetically different trees by
observations of leaf shape growth over brief time intervals. With a test based
on Procrustes tangent space coordinates, not involving the shape space's
curvature, neither can be achieved.
