We present a new grid of model photospheres for the SDSS-III/APOGEE survey of
stellar populations of the Galaxy, calculated using the ATLAS9 and MARCS codes.
New opacity distribution functions were generated to calculate ATLAS9 model
photospheres. MARCS models were calculated based on opacity sampling
techniques. The metallicity ([M/H]) spans from -5 to 1.5 for ATLAS and -2.5 to
0.5 for MARCS models. There are three main differences with respect to previous
ATLAS9 model grids: a new corrected H2O linelist, a wide range of carbon
([C/M]) and alpha element [alpha/M] variations, and solar reference abundances
from Asplund et al. 2005. The added range of varying carbon and alpha element
abundances also extends the previously calculated MARCS model grids. Altogether
1980 chemical compositions were used for the ATLAS9 grid, and 175 for the MARCS
grid. Over 808 thousand ATLAS9 models were computed spanning temperatures from
3500K to 30000K and log g from 0 to 5, where larger temperatures only have high
gravities. The MARCS models span from 3500K to 5500K, and log g from 0 to 5.
All model atmospheres are publically available online.
