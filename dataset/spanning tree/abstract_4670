Genetic association tests involving copy-number variants (CNVs) are
complicated by the fact that CNVs span multiple markers at which measurements
are taken. The power of an association test at a single marker is typically
low, and it is desirable to pool information across the markers spanned by the
CNV. However, CNV boundaries are not known in advance, and the best way to
proceed with this pooling is unclear. In this article, we propose a
kernel-based method for aggregation of marker-level tests and explore several
aspects of its implementation. In addition, we explore some of the theoretical
aspects of marker-level test aggregation, proposing a permutation-based
approach that preserves the family-wise error rate of the testing procedure,
while demonstrating that several simpler alternatives fail to do so. The
empirical power of the approach is studied in a number of simulations
constructed from real data involving a pharmacogenomic study of gemcitabine,
and compares favorably with several competing approaches.
