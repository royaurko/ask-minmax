We present a new method for the numerical evaluation of loop integrals which
is based on the Feynman Tree Theorem. The loop integrals are replaced by
phase-space integration over fictitious extra on-shell particles. This
integration can be performed alongside with the Monte-Carlo integration of
ordinary phase space, avoiding the time-consuming nesting of loop evaluation
inside the integrand, and directly leading to NLO event generation. We
systematically construct subtractions, necessary to cancel both ultraviolet
divergences and the extra threshold singularities in phase-space which arise in
the numerical evaluation. Infrared singularities can be dealt with by standard
methods. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to NLO Bhabha scattering in
QED and construct the corresponding NLO Monte Carlo event generator.
