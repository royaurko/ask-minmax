Simple representation for the average value of the W-boson one-loop
polarization tensor in a magnetic field B=const, calculated in the ground state
of the tree-level spectrum, is derived. It corresponds to Demeur's formula for
electron in QED. The energy of this state, describing effective particle mass,
is computed by solving the Schwinger-Dyson equation. As application, we
investigate the effective mass squared at the threshold of the tree-level
instability, $B \to B_c = m^2/e$, and show that it is positive. In this way the
stability of the W-boson spectrum is established. Some peculiarities of the
results obtained and other applications are discussed.
