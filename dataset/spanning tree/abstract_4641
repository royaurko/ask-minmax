This paper presents a novel approach for web video categorization by
leveraging Wikipedia categories (WikiCs) and open resources describing the same
content as the video, i.e., content-duplicated open resources (CDORs). Note
that current approaches only col-lect CDORs within one or a few media forms and
ignore CDORs of other forms. We explore all these resources by utilizing WikiCs
and commercial search engines. Given a web video, its discrimin-ative Wikipedia
concepts are first identified and classified. Then a textual query is
constructed and from which CDORs are collected. Based on these CDORs, we
propose to categorize web videos in the space spanned by WikiCs rather than
that spanned by raw tags. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
both the proposed CDOR collection method and the WikiC voting catego-rization
algorithm. In addition, the categorization model built based on both WikiCs and
CDORs achieves better performance compared with the models built based on only
one of them as well as state-of-the-art approach.
