In this paper we work in perturbative Quantum Gravity coupled to Scalar
Matter at tree level and we introduce a new effective model in analogy with the
Fermi theory of weak interaction and in relation with a previous work where we
have studied only the gravity and its self-interaction. This is an extension of
the I.T.B model (Intermediate-Tensor-Boson) for gravity also to gravitational
interacting scalar matter. We show that in a particular gauge the infinite
series of interactions containing "n" gravitons and two scalars could be
rewritten in terms of only two Lagrangians containing a massive field, the
graviton and, obviously, the scalar field. Using the S-matrix we obtain that
the low energy limit of the amplitude reproduce the local Lagrangian for the
scalar matter coupled to gravity.
