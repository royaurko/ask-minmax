In this paper we develop two characterizations for the isomorphism of graphs.
The first characterization is obtained by associating certain bitableaux with
the graphs, which are the usual adjacency and incidence matrices used in the
matrix representation of graphs expressed in a bi-tabular form. We order these
bitableaux by suitably defined lexicographic order and denote the bitableau
that is least in this order as the standard representation for the associated
graph. The standard representation characterizes the graph uniquely. The second
characterization is obtained in terms of associated rooted, unordered, pseudo
trees. We show that the isomorphism of two given graphs is implied by the
isomorphism of their associated pseudo trees. We discuss in brief the
complexity of these characterizations described in this paper for deciding
isomorphism of graphs. Finally, we discuss the k-clique problem in the light of
these characterizations towards the end of the paper.
