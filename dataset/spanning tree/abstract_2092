We study very small trees from the point of view of reducing systems of free
factors, which are analogues of reducing systems of curves for a surface
lamination; a non-trivial, proper free factor $F \leq \FN$ reduces $T$ if and
only if $F$ acts on some subtree of $T$ with dense orbits. We characterize
those trees, called arational, which do not admit a reduction by any free
factor: $T$ is arational if and only if either $T$ is free and indecomposable
or $T$ is dual to a surface with one boundary component equipped with an
arational measured foliation. To complement this result, we establish some
results giving control over the collection of all factors reducing a given
tree. As an application, we deduce a form of the celebrated Bestvina-Handel
classification theorem for elements of $Out(\FN)$. We also include an appendix
containing examples of very small trees. The results of this paper are used in
Bestvina and Reynolds (2012), where we describe the Gromov boundary of the
complex of free factors.
