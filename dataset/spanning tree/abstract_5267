We present the historic photographic light curves of three little known
Blazars (two BL Lacs and one FSRQ), BZB J1058+5628, BZQ J1148+5254 and BZB
J1209+4119 spanning a time interval of about 50 years, mostly built using the
Asiago plate archive. All objects show evident long-term variability, over
which short-term variations are superposed. One source, BZB J1058+5628, showed
a marked quasi-periodic variability of 1 mag on time scale of about 6.3 years,
making it one of the few BL Lac objects with a quasi-periodic behavior.
