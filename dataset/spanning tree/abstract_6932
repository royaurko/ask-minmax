The Georgi-Machacek model adds scalar triplets to the Standard Model Higgs
sector in such a way as to preserve custodial SU(2) symmetry in the scalar
potential. This allows the triplets to have a non-negligible vacuum expectation
value while satisfying constraints from the rho parameter. Depending on the
parameters, the 125~GeV neutral Higgs particle can have couplings to WW and ZZ
larger than in the Standard Model due to mixing with the triplets. The model
also contains singly- and doubly-charged Higgs particles that couple to vector
boson pairs at tree level (WZ and like-sign WW, respectively).
  GMCALC is a self-contained FORTRAN program that, given a set of input
parameters, calculates the particle spectrum and tree-level couplings in the
Georgi-Machacek model, checks theoretical and indirect constraints, and
computes the branching ratios and total widths of the scalars. It also
generates a param_card.dat file for MadGraph5 to be used with the corresponding
FeynRules model implementation.
