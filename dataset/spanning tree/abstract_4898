We prove a "uniform" version of the finite density Halpern-L\"{a}uchli
Theorem. Specifically, we say that a tree $T$ is homogeneous if it is uniquely
rooted and there is an integer $b\geq 2$, called the branching number of $T$,
such that every $t\in T$ has exactly $b$ immediate successors. We show the
following.
  For every integer $d\geq 1$, every $b_1,...,b_d\in\mathbb{N}$ with $b_i\geq
2$ for all $i\in\{1,...,d\}$, every integer $k\meg 1$ and every real
$0<\epsilon\leq 1$ there exists an integer $N$ with the following property. If
$(T_1,...,T_d)$ are homogeneous trees such that the branching number of $T_i$
is $b_i$ for all $i\in\{1,...,d\}$, $L$ is a finite subset of $\mathbb{N}$ of
cardinality at least $N$ and $D$ is a subset of the level product of
$(T_1,...,T_d)$ satisfying \[|D\cap \big(T_1(n)\times ...\times T_d(n)\big)|
\geq \epsilon |T_1(n)\times ...\times T_d(n)|\] for every $n\in L$, then there
exist strong subtrees $(S_1,...,S_d)$ of $(T_1,...,T_d)$ of height $k$ and with
common level set such that the level product of $(S_1,...,S_d)$ is contained in
$D$. The least integer $N$ with this property will be denoted by
$UDHL(b_1,...,b_d|k,\epsilon)$.
  The main point is that the result is independent of the position of the
finite set $L$. The proof is based on a density increment strategy and gives
explicit upper bounds for the numbers $UDHL(b_1,...,b_d|k,\epsilon)$.
