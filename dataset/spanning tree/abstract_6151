We describe, analyze, and evaluate experimentally a new probabilistic model
for word-sequence prediction in natural language based on prediction suffix
trees (PSTs). By using efficient data structures, we extend the notion of PST
to unbounded vocabularies. We also show how to use a Bayesian approach based on
recursive priors over all possible PSTs to efficiently maintain tree mixtures.
These mixtures have provably and practically better performance than almost any
single model. We evaluate the model on several corpora. The low perplexity
achieved by relatively small PST mixture models suggests that they may be an
advantageous alternative, both theoretically and practically, to the widely
used n-gram models.
