We show that the critical probability for percolation on a d-regular
non-amenable graph of large girth is close to the critical probability for
percolation on an infinite d-regular tree. This is a special case of a
conjecture due to O. Schramm on the locality of p_c. We also prove a finite
analogue of the conjecture for expander graphs.
