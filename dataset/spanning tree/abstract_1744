Recently, 2-protected nodes were studied in the context of ordered trees and
$k$-trees. These nodes have a distance of at least 2 to each leaf. Here, we
study digital search trees, which are binary trees, but with a different
probability distribution underlying. Our result says, that \emph{grosso modo}
some 31% of the nodes are 2-protected. Methods include exponential generating
functions, contour integration, and some elements from $q$-analysis.
