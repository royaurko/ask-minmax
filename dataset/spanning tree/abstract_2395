We consider finite range Gibbs fields and provide a purely combinatorial
proof of the exponential tree decay of semi--invariants, supposing that the
logarithm of the partition function can be expressed as a sum of suitable local
functions of the boundary conditions. This hypothesis holds for completely
analytical Gibbs fields; in this context the tree decay of semi--invariants has
been proven via analyticity arguments. However the combinatorial proof given
here can be applied also to the more complicated case of disordered systems in
the so called Griffiths' phase when analyticity arguments fail.
