We consider ferromagnetic Ising models on graphs that converge locally to
trees. Examples include random regular graphs with bounded degree and uniformly
random graphs with bounded average degree. We prove that the "cavity"
prediction for the limiting free energy per spin is correct for any positive
temperature and external field. Further, local marginals can be approximated by
iterating a set of mean field (cavity) equations. Both results are achieved by
proving the local convergence of the Boltzmann distribution on the original
graph to the Boltzmann distribution on the appropriate infinite random tree.
