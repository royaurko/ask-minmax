A self-stabilizing is naturally resilient to transients faults (that is,
faults of finite duration). Recently, a new class of protocol appears. These
protocols are self-stabilizing and are moreover resilient to a limited number
of permanent faults. In this article, we interest in self-stabilizing protocols
that tolerate very hard permanent faults: Byzantine faults. We introduce two
new scheme of Byzantine containment in self-stabilizing systems. We show that,
for the problem of BFS spanning tree construction, the well known
self-stabilizing protocol min+1 provides without significant modification the
best Byzantine containment with respect to these new schemes.
