LRM-Trees are an elegant way to partition a sequence of values into sorted
consecutive blocks, and to express the relative position of the first element
of each block within a previous block. They were used to encode ordinal trees
and to index integer arrays in order to support range minimum queries on them.
We describe how they yield many other convenient results in a variety of areas,
from data structures to algorithms: some compressed succinct indices for range
minimum queries; a new adaptive sorting algorithm; and a compressed succinct
data structure for permutations supporting direct and indirect application in
time all the shortest as the permutation is compressible.
