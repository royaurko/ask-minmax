We have developed a 3-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer model which computes
line and continuum polarization variability for a binary system with an
optically thick non-axisymmetric envelope. This allows us to investigate the
complex (phase-locked) line and continuum polarization variability features
displayed by many massive binaries: W-R+O, O+O, etc. An 8-way tree data
structure constructed via a ``cell-splitting'' method allows for high precision
with efficient use of computer resources. The model is not restricted to binary
systems; it can easily be adapted to a system with an arbitrary density
distribution and large density gradients. As an application to a real system,
the phase dependent Stokes parameters (I, Q, U) and the phase dependent He I
(5876) profiles of the massive binary system V444 Cyg (WN5+O6 III-V) are
computed.
