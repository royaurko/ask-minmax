The fundamental PP reaction has never been attempted in the laboratory as
theory states it cannot be measured within the human life span. This forms the
foundation of stellar nucleosynthesis and the standard solar model. Yet
numerous observations including the Sun's obvious variability argue the theory
is flawed and the reaction occurs in times many orders of magnitude shorter
than prediction. Considering the consequence to accepted models and controlled
fusion, testing is warranted.
