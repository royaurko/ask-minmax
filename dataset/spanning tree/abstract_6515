Scattering amplitudes of gluons coupled with a pair of massive scalars,
so-called massive scalar amplitudes, provide the simplest yet physically useful
examples of massive amplitudes. In this paper we construct an S-matrix
functional for the massive scalar amplitudes in a recently developed holonomy
formalism in supertwistor space. From the S-matrix functional we derive ultra
helicity violating (UHV), as well as next-to-UHV (NUHV), massive scalar
amplitudes at tree level in a form that agrees with previously known results.
We also obtain recursive expressions for non-UHV tree amplitudes in general.
These results will open up a new avenue to the study of phenomenology in the
spinor-helicity formalism.
