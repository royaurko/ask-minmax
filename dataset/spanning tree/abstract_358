Multifragmentation is the most extensively studied phenomena in this energy
domain. In the past people have tried to develop various methods of
clusterization[1]. Among these methods minimum spanning tree[1] is one of the
fastest method. In the present study our aim is to understand the role of
spatial constraints on fragmentation.
