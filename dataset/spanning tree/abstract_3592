We discuss an analogon to the Farrell-Jones Conjecture for homotopy algebraic
K-theory. In particular, we prove that if a group G acts on a tree and all
isotropy groups satisfy this conjecture, then G satisfies this conjecture. This
result can be used to get rational injectivity results for the assembly map in
the Farrell-Jones Conjecture in algebraic K-theory.
