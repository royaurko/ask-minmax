Given a bounded valence, bushy tree T, we prove that any cobounded
quasi-action of a group G on T is quasiconjugate to an action of G on another
bounded valence, bushy tree T'. This theorem has many applications:
quasi-isometric rigidity for fundamental groups of finite, bushy graphs of
coarse PD(n) groups for each fixed n; a generalization to actions on Cantor
sets of Sullivan's Theorem about uniformly quasiconformal actions on the
2-sphere; and a characterization of locally compact topological groups which
contain a virtually free group as a cocompact lattice. Finally, we give the
first examples of two finitely generated groups which are quasi-isometric and
yet which cannot act on the same proper geodesic metric space, properly
discontinuously and cocompactly by isometries.
