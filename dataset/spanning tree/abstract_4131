In the light of new experimental results on B -> K pi decays, we critically
study the decay processes B -> K pi in a phenomenological way. Using the quark
diagram approach and the currently available data, we determine the allowed
values of the relevant theoretical parameters, corresponding to the electroweak
(EW) penguin, the color-suppressed tree contribution, etc. In order to find the
most likely values of the parameters in a statistically reliable way, we use
the chi^2 minimization technique. Our result shows that the current data for B
to K pi decays strongly indicate (large) enhancements of both the EW penguin
and the color-suppressed tree contributions. In particular, the
color-suppressed tree effect needs to be enhanced by about an order of
magnitude to fit the present data.
