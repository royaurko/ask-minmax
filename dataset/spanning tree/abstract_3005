Sturm's oscillation theorem states that the n-th eigenfunction of a
Sturm-Liouville operator on the interval has n-1 zeros (nodes). This result was
generalized for all metric tree graphs and an analogous theorem was proven for
discrete tree graphs. We prove the converse theorems for both discrete and
metric graphs. Namely, if for all n, the n-th eigenfunction of the graph has
n-1 zeros then the graph is a tree. Our proofs use a recently obtained
connection between the graph's nodal count and the magnetic stability of its
eigenvalues. In the course of the proof we show that it is not possible for all
(or even almost all, in the metric case) the eigenvalues to exhibit a
diamagnetic behaviour. In addition, we develop a notion of 'discretized'
versions of a metric graph and prove that their nodal counts are related to
this of the metric graph.
