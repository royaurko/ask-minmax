We report the results of BeppoSAX and ASCA observations of the X-ray source
1E1743.1-2843, located in the region of the galactic center, performed between
1993 and 1998.
 Observations spanning almost twenty years show that 1E1743.1-2843 is a
persistent X-ray source, most likely powered by accretion onto a compact
galactic object. The absence of periodic pulsations and the relatively soft
X-ray spectrum favour a Low Mass X-ray Binary containing a neutron star.
However, no Type I X-ray bursts have been observed in more than 650 ks of
observations, leaving other interpretations possible.
