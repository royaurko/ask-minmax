Owing to the dramatic evolution of telescopes as well as optical detectors in
the last 20 yrs, we are now able to measure anew the proper motion of the Crab
pulsar, after the classical result of Wyckoff and Murray (1977) in a time span
40 times shorter. The proper motion is aligned with the axis of symmetry of the
inner Crab nebula and, presumably, with the pulsar spin axis.
