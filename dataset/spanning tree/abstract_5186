The statistical properties of fluid particles transported by a fully
developed turbulent flow are investigated by means of high resolution direct
numerical simulations. Single trajectory statistics is investigated in a time
range spanning more than three decades, from less than a tenth of the
Kolmogorov timescale up to one large-eddy turnover time. Acceleration and
velocity statistics show a neat quantitative agreement with recent experimental
results. Trapping effects in vortex filaments give rise to enhanced small-scale
intermittency on Lagrangian observables.
