Inferential summaries of tree estimates are useful in the setting of
evolutionary biology, where phylogenetic trees have been built from DNA data
since the 1960's. In bioinformatics, psychometrics and data mining,
hierarchical clustering techniques output the same mathematical objects, and
practitioners have similar questions about the stability and `generalizability'
of these summaries. This paper provides an implementation of the geometric
distance between trees developed by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann (2001) [BHV]
equally applicable to phylogenetic trees and hieirarchical clustering trees,
and shows some of the applications in statistical inference for which this
distance can be useful. In particular, since BHV have shown that the space of
trees is negatively curved (a CAT(0) space), a natural representation of a
collection of trees is a tree. We compare this representation to the Euclidean
approximations of treespace made available through Multidimensional Scaling of
the matrix of distances between trees. We also provide applications of the
distances between trees to hierarchical clustering trees constructed from
microarrays. Our method gives a new way of evaluating the influence both of
certain columns (positions, variables or genes) and of certain rows (whether
species, observations or arrays).
