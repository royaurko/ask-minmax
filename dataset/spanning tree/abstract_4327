We present results on the chiral transition temperature Tc in 2+1 flavor QCD
extrapolated to the continuum limit and the physical light quark mass. The
extrapolations are based on the data from simulations on lattices with temporal
extent Ntau=6, 8 and 12 with the HISQ/tree and Ntau=8 and 12 with the asqtad
action. The chiral transition is analyzed in terms of universal O(N) scaling
functions. After performing simultaneous asqtad and HISQ/tree continuum
extrapolation the chiral transition temperature is Tc=154 +/- 9 MeV. We also
discuss the deconfinement aspects of the transition in terms of the
renormalized Polyakov loop, fluctuations and correlations of several conserved
charges and the trace anomaly.
