We apply the renormalization group approach to the sandpile on the triangular
lattice. The only attractive fixed point is found. The obtained fixed point
height probabilities are compared with numerical simulations. The value of
critical exponent of avalanche size distribution is found to be $\tau=1.36$.
The probabilities of the sand transition are compared with the branching
probabilities of the spanning trees on the triangular lattice which are also
evaluated.
