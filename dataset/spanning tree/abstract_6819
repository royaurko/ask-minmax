We introduce a technique using non-backtracking random walk for estimating
the spectral radius of simple random walk. This technique relates the density
of non-trivial cycles in simple random walk to that in non-backtracking random
walk. We apply this to infinite Ramanujan graphs, which are regular graphs
whose spectral radius equals that of the tree of the same degree. Kesten showed
that the only infinite Ramanujan graphs that are Cayley graphs are trees. This
result was extended to unimodular random rooted regular graphs by Ab\'ert,
Glasner and Vir\'ag. We show that an analogous result holds for all regular
graphs: the frequency of times spent by simple random walk in a non-trivial
cycle is a.s. 0 on every infinite Ramanujan graph. We also give quantitative
versions of that result, which we apply to answer another question of Ab\'ert,
Glasner and Vir\'ag, showing that on an infinite Ramanujan graph, the
probability that simple random walk encounters a short cycle tends to 0 a.s. as
the time tends to infinity.
