We prove that any graph $G$ with $n$ points has a distribution $\mathcal{T}$
over spanning trees such that for any edge $(u,v)$ the expected stretch $E_{T
\sim \mathcal{T}}[d_T(u,v)/d_G(u,v)]$ is bounded by $\tilde{O}(\log n)$. Our
result is obtained via a new approach of building ``highways'' between portals
and a new strong diameter probabilistic decomposition theorem.
