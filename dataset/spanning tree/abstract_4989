The possibility that the magnetic field is strongly correlated with the
large-scale structure of the universe has been recently considered in the
literature. In this scenario the intergalactic magnetic field has a strong
($\mu$G) regular component spanning tens of Mpc but localized in sheets and
filaments, while the vast voids in between are almost free of magnetic field.
If true, this could have important consequences on the propagation of
ultra-high energy cosmic rays, and severely affect our capacity of doing
astronomy with charged particles. A quantitative discussion of these effects is
given in the present work.
