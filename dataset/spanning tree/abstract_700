What conditions ensure that a graph G contains some given spanning subgraph
H? The most famous examples of results of this kind are probably Dirac's
theorem on Hamilton cycles and Tutte's theorem on perfect matchings. Perfect
matchings are generalized by perfect F-packings, where instead of covering all
the vertices of G by disjoint edges, we want to cover G by disjoint copies of a
(small) graph F. It is unlikely that there is a characterization of all graphs
G which contain a perfect F-packing, so as in the case of Dirac's theorem it
makes sense to study conditions on the minimum degree of G which guarantee a
perfect F-packing.
  The Regularity lemma of Szemeredi and the Blow-up lemma of Komlos, Sarkozy
and Szemeredi have proved to be powerful tools in attacking such problems and
quite recently, several long-standing problems and conjectures in the area have
been solved using these. In this survey, we give an outline of recent progress
(with our main emphasis on F-packings, Hamiltonicity problems and tree
embeddings) and describe some of the methods involved.
