We introduce a new formalism for defining and computing the volumes of
completely general polytopes in any dimension. The expressions that we obtain
for these volumes are independent of any triangulation, and manifestly depend
only on the vertices of the underlying polytope. As one application of this
formalism, we obtain new expressions for tree-level, n-point NMHV amplitudes in
N=4 Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory.
