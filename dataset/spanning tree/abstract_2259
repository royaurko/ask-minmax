We answer a question of Laszlo Babai concerning the abelian sandpile model.
Given a graph, the model yields a finite abelian group of recurrent
configurations which is closely related to the combinatorial Laplacian of the
graph. We explicitly describe the group elements and operations in the case of
thick trees with loops--that is, graphs which are obtained from trees by
setting arbitrary edge multiplicities and adding loops at vertices. We do this
both concretely (by describing the so-called recurrent and identity
configurations) and abstractly (by computing the group's abstract structure),
and define maps identifying the two.
