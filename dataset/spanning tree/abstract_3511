In this series of articles we study connections between combinatorics of
multidimensional generalizations of Cauchy identity and continuous objects such
as multidimensional Brownian motions and Brownian bridges.
  In Part I of the series we present a bijective proof of multidimensional
generalizations of the Cauchy identity. Our bijection uses oriented planar
trees equipped with some linear orders.
