In this paper, we present the description of a simplified model of the
dynamic of a mono-specific even-aged forest. The model studied is a tree-growth
model based on a system of two ordinary differential equations concerning the
tree basal area and the number of trees. The analytical study of this model
permits us to predict the behavior of the system solutions. We are trying to
highlight the influence of economic parameters and growth parameters on the
system solutions, in the framework of the optimization of silviculture.
