We explore mechanical properties of top down fabricated, singly clamped
inverted conical GaAs nanowires. Combining nanowire lengths of 2-9 $\mu$m with
foot diameters of 36-935 nm yields fundamental flexural eigenmodes spanning two
orders of magnitude from 200 kHz to 42 MHz. We extract a size-independent value
of Young's modulus of (45$\pm$3) GPa. With foot diameters down to a few tens of
nanometers, the investigated nanowires are promising candidates for
ultra-flexible and ultra-sensitive nanomechanical devices.
