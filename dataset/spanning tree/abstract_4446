There is a large discrepancy in our understanding of uncapacitated and
capacitated versions of network location problems. This is perhaps best
illustrated by the classical k-center problem: there is a simple tight
2-approximation algorithm for the uncapacitated version whereas the first
constant factor approximation algorithm for the general version with capacities
was only recently obtained by using an intricate rounding algorithm that
achieves an approximation guarantee in the hundreds.
  Our paper aims to bridge this discrepancy. For the capacitated k-center
problem, we give a simple algorithm with a clean analysis that allows us to
prove an approximation guarantee of 9. It uses the standard LP relaxation and
comes close to settling the integrality gap (after necessary preprocessing),
which is narrowed down to either 7, 8 or 9. The algorithm proceeds by first
reducing to special tree instances, and then solves such instances optimally.
Our concept of tree instances is quite versatile, and applies to natural
variants of the capacitated k-center problem for which we also obtain improved
algorithms. Finally, we give evidence to show that more powerful preprocessing
could lead to better algorithms, by giving an approximation algorithm that
beats the integrality gap for instances where all non-zero capacities are
uniform.
