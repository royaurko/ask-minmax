Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used to
characterize an amorphous layer observed at the interface in graphite and
graphene films grown via thermal decomposition of C-face 4H-SiC. The amorphous
layer does not to cover the entire interface, but uniform contiguous regions
span microns of cross-sectional interface. Annular dark field scanning
transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) images and electron energy loss
spectroscopy (EELS) demonstrate that the amorphous layer is a carbon-rich
composition of Si/C. The amorphous layer is clearly observed in samples grown
at 1600{\deg}C for a range of growth pressures in argon, but not at
1500{\deg}C, suggesting a temperature-dependent formation mechanism.
