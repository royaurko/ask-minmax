In the last three decades, researchers have tried to establish universal
patterns about the structure of food webs. Recently was proposed that the
exponent $\eta$ characterizing the efficiency of the energy transportation of
the food web had a universal value ($\eta=1.13$). Here we establish a lower
bound and an upper one for this exponent in a general spanning tree with the
number of trophic species and the trophic levels fixed. When the number of
species is large the lower and upper bounds are equal to 1, implying that the
result $\eta=1.13$ is due to finite size effects. We also evaluate analytically
and numerically the exponent $\eta$ for hierarchical and random networks. In
all cases the exponent $\eta$ depends on the number of trophic species $K$ and
when $K$ is large we have that $\eta\to 1$. Moreover, this result holds for any
number $M$ of trophic levels. This means that food webs are very efficient
resource transportation systems.
