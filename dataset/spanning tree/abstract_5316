Motivated by the usual D2-D0 system, we consider a configuration composed of
flat membrane and fuzzy sphere membrane in plane-wave matrix model, and
investigate the interaction between them. The configuration is shown to lead to
a non-trivial interaction potential, which indicates that the fuzzy sphere
membrane really behaves like a graviton, giant graviton. Interestingly, the
interaction is of r^{-3} type rather than r^{-5} type. We interpret it as the
interaction incorporating the smearing effect due to the fact that the
considered supersymmetric flat membrane should span and spin in four
dimensional subspace of plane-wave geometry.
