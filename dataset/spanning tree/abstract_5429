Non-uniform B-spline dictionaries on a compact interval are discussed. For
each given partition, dictionaries of B-spline functions for the corresponding
spline space are constructed. It is asserted that, by dividing the given
partition into subpartitions and joining together the bases for the concomitant
subspaces, slightly redundant dictionaries of B-splines functions are obtained.
Such dictionaries are proved to span the spline space associated to the given
partition. The proposed construction is shown to be potentially useful for the
purpose of sparse signal representation. With that goal in mind, spline spaces
specially adapted to produce a sparse representation of a given signal are
considered.
