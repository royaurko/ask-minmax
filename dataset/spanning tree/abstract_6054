The prolific magnetar SGR 1900+14 showed two outbursts in the last decade and
has been closely monitored in the X-rays to track the changes in its radiative
properties. We use archival Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of SGR 1900+14
to construct a history of its spectrum and persistent X-ray flux spanning a
period of about seven years. We show that the decline of its X-ray flux in
these two outburst episodes follows the same trend. The flux begins to decline
promptly and rapidly subsequent to the flares, then decreases gradually for
about 600 days, at which point it resumes a more rapid decline. Utilizing the
high quality spectral data in each epoch, we also study the spectral
coevolution of the source with its flux. We find that neither the magnetic
field strength nor the magnetospheric properties change over the period spanned
by the observations, while the surface temperature as well as the inferred
emitting area both decline with time following both outbursts. We also show
that the source reached the same minimum flux level in its decline from these
two subsequent outbursts, suggesting that this flux level may be its steady
quiescent flux.
