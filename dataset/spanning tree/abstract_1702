In a recent paper we introduced a new framework for the study of call by need
computations to normal form and root-stable form in term rewriting. Using
elementary tree automata techniques and ground tree transducers we obtained
simple decidability proofs for classes of rewrite systems that are much larger
than earlier classes defined using the complicated sequentiality concept. In
this paper we show that we can do without ground tree transducers in order to
arrive at decidability proofs that are phrased in direct tree automata
constructions. This allows us to derive better complexity bounds.
