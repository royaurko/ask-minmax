We evaluate the inclusive semileptonic B decay spectrum as a function of the
final-state hadrons energy to second order in the inverse quark mass expansion
and tree level in $\alpha_{s}$. We argue that there is an energy interval below
the $c$ production threshold that could be used to determine $V_{ub}$.
