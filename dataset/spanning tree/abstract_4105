In key management schemes that realize secure multicast communications
encrypted by group keys on a public network, tree structures are often used to
update the group keys efficiently. Selcuk and Sidhu have proposed an efficient
scheme which updates dynamically the tree structures based on the withdrawal
probabilities of members. In this paper, it is shown that Selcuk-Sidhu scheme
is asymptotically optimal for the cost of withdrawal. Furthermore, a new key
management scheme, which takes account of key update costs of joining in
addition to withdrawal, is proposed. It is proved that the proposed scheme is
also asymptotically optimal, and it is shown by simulation that it can attain
good performance for nonasymptotic cases.
