Let $G$ be a finite tree with root $r$ and associate to the internal vertices
of $G$ a collection of transition probabilities for a simple nondegenerate
Markov chain. Embedd $G$ into a graph $G^\prime$ constructed by gluing finite
linear chains of length at least 2 to the terminal vertices of $G.$ Then
$G^\prime$ admits distinguished boundary layers and the transition
probabilities associated to the internal vertices of $G$ can be augmented to
define a simple nondegenerate Markov chain $X$ on the vertices of $G^\prime.$
We show that the transition probabilities of $X$ can be recovered from the
joint distribution of first hitting time and first hitting place of $X$ started
at the root $r$ for the distinguished boundary layers of $G^\prime.$
