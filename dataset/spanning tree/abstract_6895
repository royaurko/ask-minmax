Color-ordered tree level scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theories can be
written as a sum over terms which display the various propagator poles of
Feynman diagrams. The numerators in these expressions which are obtained by
straightforward application of Feynman rules are not satisfying any particular
relations, typically. However, by reshuffling terms, it is known that one can
arrive at a set of numerators which satisfy the same Jacobi identity as the
corresponding color factors. By extending previous work by us we show how this
can be systematically accomplished within a Lagrangian framework. We construct
an effective Lagrangian which yields tree-level color-kinematic symmetric
numerators in Yang-Mills theories in a light-like gauge at five-points. The
five-point effective Lagrangian is non-local and it is zero by Jacobi identity.
The numerators obtained from it respect the original pole structure of the
color-ordered amplitude. We discuss how this procedure can be systematically
extended to higher order.
