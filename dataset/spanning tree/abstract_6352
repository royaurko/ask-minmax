The problem of extracting information on new and known $N^{*}$ resonances by
fitting isobar models to photonuclear data is addressed. A new fitting
strategy, incorporating a genetic algorithm, is outlined. As an example, the
method is applied to a typical tree-level analysis of published
$p(\gamma,K^{+})\Lambda$ data. It is shown that, within the limitations of this
tree-level analysis, a resonance in addition to the known set is required to
obtain a reasonable fit. An additional $P_{11}$ resonance, with a mass of about
1.9 GeV, gives the best agreement with the published data, but additional
$S_{11}$ or $D_{13}$ resonances cannot be ruled out. Our genetic algorithm
method predicts that photon beam asymmetry and double polarization
$p(\gamma,K^{+})\Lambda$ measurements should provide the most sensitive
information with respect to missing resonances.
