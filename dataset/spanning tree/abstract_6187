The propagator of a virtual $\phi$-field with emission of $n$ on-mass-shell
particles all being exactly at rest is calculated at the tree-level in $\lambda
\phi^4$ theory by directly solving recursion equations for the sum of Feynman
graphs. It is shown that the generating function for these propagators is
equivalent to a Fourier transform of the recently found Green's function within
the background-field technique for summing graphs at threshold suggested by
Lowell Brown. Also the derivation of the result that the tree-level
on-mass-shell scattering amplitudes of the processes $2 \to n$ are exactly
vanishing at threshold for $n > 4$ is thus given in the more conventional
Feynman diagram technique.
