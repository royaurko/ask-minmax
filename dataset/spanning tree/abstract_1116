This paper presents a novel approach to multiple access control called coded
splitting tree protocol. The approach builds on the known tree splitting
protocols, code structure and successive interference cancellation (SIC).
Several instances of the tree splitting protocol are initiated, each instance
is terminated prematurely and subsequently iterated. The combined set of leaves
from all the tree instances can then be viewed as a graph code, which is
decodable using belief propagation. The main design problem is determining the
order of splitting, which enables successful decoding as early as possible.
Evaluations show that the proposed protocol provides considerable gains over
the standard tree splitting protocol applying SIC. The improvement comes at the
expense of an increased feedback and receiver complexity.
