We discuss the enumeration of Feynman diagrams at tree order for processes
with external lines of different types. We show how this can be done by
iterating algebraic Schwinger-Dyson equations. Asymptotic estimates for very
many external lines are derived. Applications include QED, QCD and scalar QED,
and the asymptotic estimates are numerically confronted with the exact results.
