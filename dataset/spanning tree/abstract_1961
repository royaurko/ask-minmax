Consider the logging process of the Brownian continuum random tree (CRT)
$\cal T$ using a Poisson point process of cuts on its skeleton [Aldous and
Pitman, Ann. Probab., vol. 26, pp. 1703--1726, 1998]. Then, the cut tree
introduced by Bertoin and Miermont describes the genealogy of the fragmentation
of $\cal T$ into connected components [Ann. Appl. Probab., vol. 23, pp.
1469--1493, 2013]. This cut tree cut$(\cal T)$ is distributed as another
Brownian CRT, and is a function of the original tree $\cal T$ and of the
randomness in the logging process. We are interested in reversing the
transformation of $\cal T$ into cut$(\cal T)$: we define a shuffling operation,
which given a Brownian CRT $\cal H$, yields another one shuff$(\cal H)$
distributed in such a way that $(\cal T$,cut$(\cal T))$ and $($shuff$(\cal H),
\cal H)$ have the same distribution.
