The category Rel(Set) of sets and relations can be described as a category of
spans and as the Kleisli category for the powerset monad. A set-functor can be
lifted to a functor on Rel(Set) iff it preserves weak pullbacks. We show that
these results extend to the enriched setting, if we replace sets by posets or
preorders. Preservation of weak pullbacks becomes preservation of exact lax
squares. As an application we present Moss's coalgebraic over posets.
