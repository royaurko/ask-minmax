We introduces the umodules, a generalisation of the notion of graph module.
The theory we develop captures among others undirected graphs, tournaments,
digraphs, and $2-$structures. We show that, under some axioms, a unique
decomposition tree exists for umodules. Polynomial-time algorithms are provided
for: non-trivial umodule test, maximal umodule computation, and decomposition
tree computation when the tree exists. Our results unify many known
decomposition like modular and bi-join decomposition of graphs, and a new
decomposition of tournaments.
