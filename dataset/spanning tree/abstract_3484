Let (X,d) be a tree (T) of hyperbolic metric spaces satisfying the
quasi-isometrically embedded condition. Let $v$ be a vertex of $T$. Let
$({X_v},d_v)$ denote the hyperbolic metric space corresponding to $v$. Then $i
: X_v \rightarrow X$ extends continuously to a map $\hat{i} : \widehat{X_v}
\rightarrow \widehat{X}$. This generalizes a Theorem of Cannon and Thurston.
The techniques are used to give a new proof of a result of Minsky: Thurston's
ending lamination conjecture for certain Kleinian groups. Applications to
graphs of hyperbolic groups and local connectivity of limit sets of Kleinian
groups are also given.
