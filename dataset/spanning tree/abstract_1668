We characterise the affine span of the midpoints sets for Thompson's metric
on symmetric cones in terms of a translation of the zero-component of the
Peirce decomposition of an idempotent. As a consequence we derive an explicit
formula for the dimension of the affine span of the midpoints sets in case the
associated Euclidean Jordan algebra is simple.
