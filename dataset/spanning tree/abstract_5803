For finite q, we classify the countable, descendant-homogeneous digraphs in
which the descendant set of any vertex is a q-valent tree. We also give
conditions on a rooted digraph G which allow us to construct a countable
descendant-homogeneous digraph in which the descendant set of any vertex is
isomorphic to G.
