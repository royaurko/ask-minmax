We use molecular simulations to demonstrate the connection between transverse
water-water correlations and wetting phenomena for a range of hydrophobic to
hydrophilic solid surfaces.Near superhydrophobic surfaces, the correlations are
long ranged, system spanning, and are well described by the capillary wave
theory. With increasing surface-water attractions, the correlations are
quenched. At the critical attraction at which long range correlations
disappear, the density profile normal to the surface changes from sigmoidal to
layered, and the fluid begins to wet the surface. This behavior is displayed by
both water and a Lennard-Jones fluid, highlighting the universality of the
underlying physics.
