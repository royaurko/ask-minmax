We explore how rotational invariance is systematically recovered from
calculations on hyper-cubic lattices through the use of smeared lattice
operators that smoothly evolve into continuum operators with definite angular
momentum as the lattice-spacing is reduced. Perturbative calculations of the
angular momentum violation associated with such operators at tree-level and at
one-loop are presented in phi^4 theory and QCD. Contributions from these
operators that violate rotational invariance occur at tree-level, with
coefficients that are suppressed by O(a^2) in the continuum limit. Quantum
loops do not modify this behavior in phi^4, nor in QCD if the gauge-fields are
smeared over a comparable spatial region. Consequently, the use of this type of
operator should, in principle, allow for Lattice QCD calculations of the higher
moments of the hadron structure functions.
