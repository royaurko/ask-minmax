A proper vertex of a rooted tree with totally ordered vertices is a vertex
that is less than all its proper descendants. We count several kinds of labeled
rooted trees and forests by the number of proper vertices. Our results are all
expressed in terms of the polynomials P_n(a,b,c)=
c(a+(n-1)b+c)(2a+(n-2)b+c)...((n-1)a+b+c) which reduce to (n+1)^{n-1} for
a=b=c=1.
  Our study of proper vertices was motivated by A. Postnikov's hook length
formula for binary trees (arXiv:math.CO/0507163), which was also proved by W.
Y. C. Chen and L. L. M. Yang (arXiv:math.CO/0507163) and generalized by R. R.
X. Du and F. Liu (arXiv:math.CO/0501147). Our approach gives a new proof of Du
and Liu's results and gives new hook length formulas.
  We also find an interpretation of the polynomials P_n(a,b,c) in terms of
parking functions: we count parking functions according to the number of cars
that park in their preferred parking spaces.
