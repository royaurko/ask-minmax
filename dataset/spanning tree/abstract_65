The problem of spanning trees is closely related to various interesting
problems in the area of statistical physics, but determining the number of
spanning trees in general networks is computationally intractable. In this
paper, we perform a study on the enumeration of spanning trees in a specific
small-world network with an exponential distribution of vertex degrees, which
is called a Farey graph since it is associated with the famous Farey sequence.
According to the particular network structure, we provide some recursive
relations governing the Laplacian characteristic polynomials of a Farey graph
and its subgraphs. Then, making use of these relations obtained here, we derive
the exact number of spanning trees in the Farey graph, as well as an
approximate numerical solution for the asymptotic growth constant
characterizing the network. Finally, we compare our results with those of
different types of networks previously investigated.
