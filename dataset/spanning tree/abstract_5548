We report on an experimental and theoretical study of the high-frequency
mixing properties of ion-irradiated YBa2Cu3O7 Josephson junctions embedded in
THz antennas. We investigated the influence of the local oscillator power and
frequency on the device performances. The experimental data are compared with
theoretical predictions of the general three-port model for mixers, in which
the junction is described by the resistively shunted junction model. A good
agreement is obtained for the conversion efficiency in different frequency
ranges, spanning above and below the characteristic frequencies fc of the
junctions.
