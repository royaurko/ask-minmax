We discover another one-parameter generalization of Postnikov's hook length
formula for binary trees. The particularity of our formula is that the hook
length $h_v$ appears as an exponent. As an application, we derive another
simple hook length formula for binary trees when the underlying parameter takes
the value 1/2.
