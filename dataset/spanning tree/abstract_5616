We find a good characterization for the following problem: Given an integral
row vector $c=(c_{1}\ldots,c_{n})$ where each $c_{i}\in\{-1,0,1\}$ and a
lattice $\Lambda\subset\mathbf{R}^{n}$ which contains the integer lattice
$\mathbf{Z}^{n}$, do all lattice points of $\Lambda$ in the half-open unit cube
$[0,1)^{n}$ lie on the hyperplane $\{x:cx=0\}$? The result is a direct
generalization of the well-known Terminal Lemma of Reid, which in turn is based
upon earlier work of Morrison and Stevens on the classification of terminal
quotient singularities.
