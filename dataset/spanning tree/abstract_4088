We analyse the statistical properties of genealogical trees in a neutral
model of a closed population with sexual reproduction and non-overlapping
generations. By reconstructing the genealogy of an individual from the
population evolution, we measure the distribution of ancestors appearing more
than once in a given tree. After a transient time, the probability of
repetition follows, up to a rescaling, a stationary distribution which we
calculate both numerically and analytically. This distribution exhibits a
universal shape with a non-trivial power law which can be understood by an
exact, though simple, renormalization calculation. Some real data on human
genealogy illustrate the problem, which is relevant to the study of the real
degree of diversity in closed interbreeding communities.
