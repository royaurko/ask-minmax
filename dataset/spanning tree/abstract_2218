This paper constructs a tree structure for the music rhythm using the
L-system. It models the structure as an automata and derives its complexity. It
also solves the complexity for the L-system. This complexity can resolve the
similarity between trees. This complexity serves as a measure of psychological
complexity for rhythms. It resolves the music complexity of various
compositions including the Mozart effect K488.
