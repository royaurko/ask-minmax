We introduce a Bernstein-Bezier basis for the pyramid, whose restriction to
the face reduces to the Bernstein-Bezier basis on the triangle or
quadrilateral. The basis satisfies the standard positivity and partition of
unity properties common to Bernstein polynomials, and spans the same space as
non-polynomial pyramid bases in the literature.
