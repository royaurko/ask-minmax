Radio labeling is a variation of Hale's channel assignment problem, in which
one seeks to assign positive integers to the vertices of a graph $G$ subject to
certain constraints involving the distances between the vertices. Specifically,
a radio labeling of a connected graph $G$ is a function $c:V(G) \rightarrow
\mathbb Z_+$ such that $$d(u,v)+|c(u)-c(v)|\geq 1+\text{diam}(G)$$ for every
two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$ (where $d(u,v)$ is the distance
between $u$ and $v$). The span of a radio labeling is the maximum integer
assigned to a vertex. The radio number of a graph $G$ is the minimum span,
taken over all radio labelings of $G$. This paper establishes the radio number
of the Cartesian product of a cycle graph with itself (i.e., of $C_n\square
C_n$.)
