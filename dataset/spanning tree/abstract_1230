We show that an algorithmic construction of sequences of recursive trees
leads to a direct proof of the convergence of random recursive trees in an
associated Doob-Martin compactification; it also gives a representation of the
limit in terms of the input sequence of the algorithm. We further show that
this approach can be used to obtain strong limit theorems for various tree
functionals, such as path length or the Wiener index.
