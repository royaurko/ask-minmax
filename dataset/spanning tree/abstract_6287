We calculate bosonic open string one-loop massive scattering amplitudes for
some low-lying string states. By using the periodicity relations of Jacobi
theta functions, we explicitly prove an infinite number of one-loop type I
stringy Ward identities derived from type I zero-norm states in the old
covariant first quantized (OCFQ) spectrum of open bosonic string. The subtlety
in the proofs of one-loop type II stringy Ward identities is discussed by
comparing with those of string-tree cases. High-energy limit of these stringy
Ward identities can be used to fix the proportionality constants between
one-loop massive high-energy scattering amplitudes of different string states
with the same momenta. These proportionality constants can not be calculated
directly from sample calculations as we did previously in the cases of
string-tree scattering amplitudes.
