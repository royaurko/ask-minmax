For coprime dimension vectors certain torus fixed points of the Kronecker
moduli space are indecomposable tree modules. They are indecomposable
representations of the regular m-tree and can be glued in order to get stable
torus fixed point for every coprime dimension vector. Using their stability and
the reflection functor we show that for arbitrary roots there exist
indecomposable tree modules of the Kronecker quiver as factor modules of these
torus fixed points.
