We study a statistical mechanical model for the dynamics of lung inflation
which incorporates recent experimental observations on the opening of
individual airways by a cascade or avalanche mechanism. Using an exact mapping
of the avalanche problem onto percolation on a Cayley tree, we analytically
derive the exponents describing the size distribution of the first avalanches
and test the analytical solution by numerical simulations. We find that the
tree-like structure of the airways together with the simplest assumptions
concerning opening threshold pressures of each airway, is sufficient to explain
the existence of power-law distributions observed experimentally.
