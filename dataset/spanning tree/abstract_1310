We develop a general statistical framework for analyzing large
tree-structured data with a focus on developing asymptotic goodness-of-fit
tests. The tests use the distributional properties of the Continuum Random Tree
(CRT), introduced by Aldous [1993], which arises as the invariant limit for a
broad class of models for tree-structured data based on conditioned
Galton-Watson processes. On the basis of two characterizations of the CRT that
involve a special class of subtrees and Brownian excursion, we evaluate its
utility in distinguishing between populations of trees. The proposed generative
probability models for tree-structured data are easily interpretable and lead
to an efficient scheme for simulating a large number of trees with arbitrary
sizes. The resulting test statistics for the goodness-of-fit tests are simple
to compute and are asymptotically distributed as Chi-square and F random
variables, allowing for a thorough examination of their properties. We
illustrate our methods on an important application of detecting tumour
heterogeneity in brain cancers. A novel approach with tree-based
representations of magnetic resonance images is used wherein the developed
tests are employed to ascertain tumour heterogeneity between two groups of
patients.
