We generalize the matroid-theoretic approach to greedy algorithms to the
setting of poset matroids, in the sense of Barnabei, Nicoletti and Pezzoli
(1998) [BNP]. We illustrate our result by providing a generalization of Kruskal
algorithm (which finds a minimum spanning subtree of a weighted graph) to
abstract simplicial complexes.
