We review two novel techniques used to calculate tree-level scattering
amplitudes efficiently: MHV diagrams, and on-shell recursion relations. For the
MHV diagrams, we consider applications to tree-level amplitudes and focus in
particular on the N=4 supersymmetric formulation. We also briefly describe the
derivation of loop amplitudes using MHV diagrams. For the recursion relations,
after presenting their general proof, we discuss several applications to
massless theories with and without supersymmetry, to theories with massive
particles, and to graviton amplitudes in General Relativity. This article is an
invited review for a special issue of Journal of Physics A devoted to
"Scattering Amplitudes in Gauge Theories".
