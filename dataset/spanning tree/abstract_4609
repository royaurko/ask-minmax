We correct an unfortunate error in an earlier work of the contributor, and show
that in center-vortex QCD (gauge group SU(3)) the baryonic area law is the
so-called $Y$ law, described by a minimal area with three surfaces spanning the
three quark world lines and meeting at a central Steiner line joining the two
common meeting points of the world lines. (The earlier claim was that this area
law was a so-called $\Delta$ law, involving three extremal areas spanning the
three pairs of quark world lines.) We give a preliminary discussion of the
extension of these results to $SU(N), N>3$. These results are based on the
(correct) baryonic Stokes' theorem given in the earlier work claiming a
$\Delta$ law. The $Y$-form area law for SU(3) is in agreement with the most
recent lattice calculations.
