Deliberation plays an important role in the design of rational agents
embedded in the real-world. In particular, deliberation leads to the formation
of intentions, i.e., plans of action that the agent is committed to achieving.
In this paper, we present a branching time possible-worlds model for
representing and reasoning about, beliefs, goals, intentions, time, actions,
probabilities, and payoffs. We compare this possible-worlds approach with the
more traditional decision tree representation and provide a transformation from
decision trees to possible worlds. Finally, we illustrate how an agent can
perform deliberation using a decision-tree representation and then use a
possible-worlds model to form and reason about his intentions.
