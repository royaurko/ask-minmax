We report results from a high resolution numerical study of fluid particles
transported by a fully developed turbulent flow. Single particle trajectories
were followed for a time range spanning more than three decades, from less than
a tenth of the Kolmogorov time-scale up to one large-eddy turnover time. We
present results concerning acceleration statistics and the statistics of
trapping by vortex filaments conditioned to the local values of vorticity and
enstrophy. We distinguish two different behaviors between the joint statistics
of vorticity and centripetal acceleration or vorticity and longitudinal
acceleration.
