We revisit tree compression with top trees (Bille et al, ICALP'13) and
present several improvements to the compressor and its analysis. By
significantly reducing the amount of information stored and guiding the
compression step using a RePair-inspired heuristic, we obtain a fast compressor
achieving good compression ratios, addressing an open problem posed by Bille et
al. We show how, with relatively small overhead, the compressed file can be
converted into an in-memory representation that supports basic navigation
operations in worst-case logarithmic time without decompression. We also show a
much improved worst-case bound on the size of the output of top-tree
compression (answering an open question posed in a talk on this algorithm by
Weimann in 2012).
