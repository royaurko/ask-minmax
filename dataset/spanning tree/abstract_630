We consider a special case of the generalized minimum spanning tree problem
(GMST) and the generalized travelling salesman problem (GTSP) where we are
given a set of points inside the integer grid (in Euclidean plane) where each
grid cell is $1 \times 1$. In the MST version of the problem, the goal is to
find a minimum tree that contains exactly one point from each non-empty grid
cell (cluster). Similarly, in the TSP version of the problem, the goal is to
find a minimum weight cycle containing one point from each non-empty grid cell.
We give a $(1+4\sqrt{2}+\epsilon)$ and $(1.5+8\sqrt{2}+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for these two problems in the described setting, respectively.
  Our motivation is based on the problem posed in [7] for a constant
approximation algorithm. The contributors designed a PTAS for the more special case
of the GMST where non-empty cells are connected end dense enough. However,
their algorithm heavily relies on this connectivity restriction and is
unpractical. Our results develop the topic further.
