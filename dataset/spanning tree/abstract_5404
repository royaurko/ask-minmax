We propose to use slot micro/nano-fiber (SMNF) to enhance the second-harmonic
generation based on surface dipole nonlinearity. The slot structure is simple
and promising to manufacture with high accuracy and reliability by mature
micromachining techniques. Light field can be enhanced and confined, and the
surface area can be increased in the sub-wavelength low-refractive-index air
slot. The maximum conversion efficiency of the SMNFs in our calculations is
about 24 times higher than that of circular micro/nano-fibers. It is promising
to provide a competing platform for a new class of fiber-based ultra-tiny light
sources spanning the UV- to the mid-infrared spectrum.
