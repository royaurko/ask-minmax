We study a model of random $\mathcal{R}$-enriched trees that is based on
weights on the $\mathcal{R}$-structures and allows for a unified treatment of a
large variety of random trees, graphs and tree-like structures. As their size
tends to infinity, these random structures converge locally to an infinite
enriched tree and we give applications of this convergence to random graphs. We
consider random metrics on random labelled and unlabelled enriched trees
patched together from independently drawn metrics on the
$\mathcal{R}$-structures. Under certain conditions we show convergence in the
Gromov-Hausdorff sense towards the Brownian continuum random tree and sharp
tail bounds for their diameter. We apply our results to models of random graphs
and trees, in particular to first passage percolation on random unlabelled
graphs drawn from a subcritical block-class, random P\'olya trees drawn
according to weights on the vertex outdegrees, and loop-trees of critical
Galton-Watson trees conditioned to be large.
