Recent research of the contributor has given an explicit geometric description of
free (two-sided) adequate semigroups and monoids, as sets of labelled directed
trees under a natural combinatorial multiplication. In this paper we show that
there are natural embeddings of each free right adequate and free left adequate
semigroup or monoid into the corresponding free adequate semigroup or monoid.
The corresponding classes of trees are easily described and the resulting
geometric representation of free left adequate and free right adequate
semigroups is even easier to understand than that in the two-sided case. We use
it to establish some basic structural properties of free left and right
adequate semigroups and monoids.
