The objective of this research was to identify factors affecting tree damage
in the historical Minot flood of 2011. We hypothesized that tree height,
identity, origin, and maximum water height affect in the severity of damage
sustained by a tree in a flood event. All these factors were significant but
highly interactive. The results from this research can influence planting
practices in valleys and other flood prone areas to mitigate future damage.
