An improved characteristic set algorithm for solving Boolean polynomial
systems is proposed. This algorithm is based on the idea of converting all the
polynomials into monic ones by zero decomposition, and using additions to
obtain pseudo-remainders. To improve the efficiency, two important techniques
are applied in the algorithm. One is eliminating variables by new generated
linear polynomials, and the other is optimizing the order of choosing
polynomial for zero decomposition. We present some complexity bounds of the
algorithm by analyzing the structure of the zero decomposition tree. Some
experimental results show that this new algorithm is more efficient than
precious characteristic set algorithms for solving Boolean polynomial systems,
and in some cases the running time of this algorithm can be well predicted by
analyzing a part of branches in the zero decomposition tree.
