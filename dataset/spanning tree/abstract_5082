We demonstrate that variations in molecular chemisorption energy on different
metals, different surface terminations, and different strain conditions can be
accounted for by orbital-specific changes in the substrate electronic
structure. Our density functional theory data set, spanning three metals, two
surface terminations, and five strain states, is fit to a single model based on
tight binding. A crucial aspect of the model is decomposition of the $d$-band
into contributions from the five $d$ atomic orbitals. This provides a
representation of the energy levels of the substrate that are directly relevant
to the chemisorption bond, leading to accurate prediction of chemisorption
trends.
