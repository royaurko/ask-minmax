A tree T_uni is m-universal for the class of trees if for every tree T of
size m, T can be obtained from T_uni by successive contractions of edges. We
prove that a m-universal tree for the class of trees has at least mln(m) +
(gamma-1)m + O(1) edges where is the Euler's constant and we build such a tree
with less than mc edges for a fixed constant c = 1.984...
