We present an optimal O*(n^2) time algorithm for deciding if a metric space
(X,d) on n points can be isometrically embedded into the plane endowed with the
l_1-metric. It improves the O*(n^2 log^2 n) time algorithm of J. Edmonds
(2008). Together with some ingredients introduced by J. Edmonds, our algorithm
uses the concept of tight span and the injectivity of the l_1-plane. A
different O*(n^2) time algorithm was recently proposed by D. Eppstein (2009).
