In brane world models of nature, supersymmetry breaking is often isolated on
a distant brane in a higher dimensional space. The form of the Kahler potential
in generic string and M-theory brane world backgrounds is shown to give rise to
tree-level non-universal squark and slepton masses. This results from the
exchange of bulk supergravity fields and warping of the internal geometry. This
is contrary to the notion that bulk locality gives rise to a sequestered
no-scale form of the Kahler potential with vanishing tree-level masses and
solves the supersymmetric flavor problem. As a result, a radiatively generated
anomaly mediated superpartner spectrum is not a generic outcome of these
theories.
