We argue that the first stars may have spanned the conventional mass range
rather than be identified with the Very Massive Objects (100-1000 solar masses)
favoured by numerical simulations. Specifically, we find that magnetic field
generation processes acting in the first protostellar systems suffice to
produce fields that exceed the threshold for MRI instability to operate and
thereby allow the MRI dynamo to generate equipartition-amplitude magnetic
fields on protostellar mass scales below 50 solar masses. Such fields allow
primordial star formation to occur at essentially any metallicity by regulating
angular momentum transfer, fragmentation, accretion and feedback in much the
same way as occurs in conventional molecular clouds.
