We consider a new kind of interpretation over relational structures: finite
sets interpretations. Those interpretations are defined by weak monadic
second-order (WMSO) formulas with free set variables. They transform a given
structure into a structure with a domain consisting of finite sets of elements
of the orignal structure. The definition of these interpretations directly
implies that they send structures with a decidable WMSO theory to structures
with a decidable first-order theory. In this paper, we investigate the
expressive power of such interpretations applied to infinite deterministic
trees. The results can be used in the study of automatic and tree-automatic
structures.
