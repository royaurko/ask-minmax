We report on the generation of a Raman cascade spanning the wavelength range
of 523 to 1750 nm wavelength range, in a standard telecommunication
graded-index multimode optical fiber. Despite the highly multimode nature of
the pump, the Raman peaks are generated in specific modes of the fiber,
confirming substantial beam cleanup during the stimulated Raman scattering
process.
