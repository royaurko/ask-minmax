Now a days many algorithms are invented or being inventing to find the
solution for Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree, EMST, problem, as its
applicability is increasing in much wide range of fields containing spatial or
spatio temporal data viz. astronomy which consists of millions of spatial data.
To solve this problem, we are presenting a technique by adopting the dual tree
algorithm for finding efficient EMST and experimented on a variety of real time
and synthetic datasets. This paper presents the observed experimental
observations and the efficiency of the dual tree framework, in the context of
kdtree and ball tree on spatial datasets of different dimensions.
