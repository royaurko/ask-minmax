For a given graph $G$ of minimum degree at least $k$, let $G_p$ denote the
random spanning subgraph of $G$ obtained by retaining each edge independently
with probability $p=p(k)$. We prove that if $p \ge \frac{\log k + \log \log k +
\omega_k(1)}{k}$, where $\omega_k(1)$ is any function tending to infinity with
$k$, then $G_p$ asymptotically almost surely contains a cycle of length at
least $k+1$. When we take $G$ to be the complete graph on $k+1$ vertices, our
theorem coincides with the classic result on the threshold probability for the
existence of a Hamilton cycle in the binomial random graph.
