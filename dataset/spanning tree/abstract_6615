Colour-kinematics duality is the conjecture of a group theory-like structure
for the kinematic dependence of scattering amplitudes in gauge theory and
gravity. This structure has been verified at tree level in various ways, but
similar progress has been lacking at loop level, where the power of the duality
would be most significant. Here we explore colour-kinematics duality at one
loop using the self-dual sector as a starting point. The duality is shown to
exist in pure Yang-Mills theory for two infinite classes of amplitudes:
amplitudes with any number of particles either all of the same helicity or with
one particle helicity opposite the rest. We provide a simple Lagrangian-based
argument in favour of the double copy relation between gauge theory and gravity
amplitudes in these classes, and provide some explicit examples. We further
discuss aspects of the duality which persist after integration, leading to
relations among partial amplitudes. Finally, we describe form factors in the
self-dual theory at tree level which also satisfy the duality.
