We consider the following, intuitively described process: at time zero, all
sites of a binary tree are at rest. Each site becomes activated at a random
uniform [0,1] time, independent of the other sites. As soon as a site is in an
infinite cluster of activated sites, this cluster of activated sites freezes.
The main question is whether a process like this exists. Aldous [Ald00] proved
that this is the case for a slightly different version of frozen percolation.
In this paper we construct a process that fits the intuitive description and
discuss some properties.
