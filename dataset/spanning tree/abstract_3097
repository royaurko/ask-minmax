We consider the problem of minimising the number of states in a multiplicity
tree automaton over the field of rational numbers. We give a minimisation
algorithm that runs in polynomial time assuming unit-cost arithmetic. We also
show that a polynomial bound in the standard Turing model would require a
breakthrough in the complexity of polynomial identity testing by proving that
the latter problem is logspace equivalent to the decision version of
minimisation. The developed techniques also improve the state of the art in
multiplicity word automata: we give an NC algorithm for minimising multiplicity
word automata. Finally, we consider the minimal consistency problem: does there
exist an automaton with $n$ states that is consistent with a given finite
sample of weight-labelled words or trees? We show that this decision problem is
complete for the existential theory of the rationals, both for words and for
trees of a fixed alphabet rank.
