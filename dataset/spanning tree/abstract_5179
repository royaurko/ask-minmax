Three classes of classical r-matrices for sl(4,C) algebra are constructed in
quasi-Frobenius algebra approach. They satisfy CYBE and are spanned
respectively on 8,10,12 generators. The o(4,2) reality condition can be imposed
only on the eight dimensional r matrices with dimension-full deformation
parameters. Contrary to the Poincare algebra case, it appears that all
deformations with a mass-like deformation parameter (kappa- deformations) are
described by classical r-matrices satisfying CYBE.
