We present a recursive method for super Yang-Mills color-ordered n-point tree
amplitudes based on the cohomology of pure spinor superspace in ten space-time
dimensions. The amplitudes are organized into BRST covariant building blocks
with diagrammatic interpretation. Manifestly cyclic expressions (no longer than
one line each) are explicitly given up to n=10 and higher leg generalizations
are straightforward.
