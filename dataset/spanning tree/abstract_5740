Given a simplicial complex, it is easy to construct a generic deformation of
its Stanley-Reisner ideal. The main question under investigation in this paper
is how to characterize the simplicial complexes such that their Stanley-Reisner
ideals have Cohen-Macaulay generic deformations. Algorithms are presented to
construct such deformations for matroid complexes, shifted complexes, and tree
complexes.
