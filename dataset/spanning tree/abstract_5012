The understanding of pulsar radio emission demands a close look at all
regions of the huge parameter space present for pulsar observations. In this
review we concentrate on the space given by the range of observed pulse
periods, spanning four orders of magnitude. A comparative study of the emission
properties of millisecond pulsars and normal pulsars, both at radio and high
energy frequencies, promises to shed light on the still poorly understood
emission theory.
