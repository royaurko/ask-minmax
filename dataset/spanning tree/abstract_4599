I present the detailed behavior of phonon dispersion curves near momenta
which span the electronic Fermi sea in a superconductor. I demonstrate that an
anomaly, similar to the metallic Kohn anomaly, exists in a superconductor's
dispersion curves when the frequency of the phonon spanning the Fermi sea
exceeds twice the superconducting energy gap. This anomaly occurs at
approximately the same momentum but is {\it stronger} than the normal-state
Kohn anomaly. It also survives at finite temperature, unlike the metallic
anomaly. Determination of Fermi surface diameters from the location of these
anomalies, therefore, may be more successful in the superconducting phase than
in the normal state. However, the superconductor's anomaly fades rapidly with
increased phonon frequency and becomes unobservable when the phonon frequency
greatly exceeds the gap. This constraint makes these anomalies useful only in
high-temperature superconductors such as $\rm La_{1.85}Sr_{.15}CuO_4$.
