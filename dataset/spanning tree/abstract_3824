We show that on groups generated by bounded activity automata, every
symmetric, finitely supported probability measure has the Liouville property.
More generally we show this for every group of automorphisms of bounded type of
a rooted tree. For automaton groups, we also give a uniform upper bound for the
entropy of convolutions of every symmetric, finitely supported measure.
