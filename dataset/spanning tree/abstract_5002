The time evolution of models for an isolated disk of highly flattened
galaxies of stars is investigated by direct integration of the Newtonian
equations of motion of N=30,000 identical stars over a time span of many
galactic rotations. Certain astronomical implications of the simulations to
actual disk-shaped (i.e. rapidly rotating) galaxies are explored as well.
