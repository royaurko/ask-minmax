This paper considers the enumeration of ternary trees (i.e. rooted ordered
trees in which each vertex has 0 or 3 children) avoiding a contiguous ternary
tree pattern. We begin by finding recurrence relations for several simple tree
patterns; then, for more complex trees, we compute generating functions by
extending a known algorithm for pattern-avoiding binary trees. Next, we present
an alternate one-dimensional notation for trees which we use to find bijections
that explain why certain pairs of tree patterns yield the same avoidance
generating function. Finally, we compare our bijections to known "replacement
rules" for binary trees and generalize these bijections to a larger class of
trees.
