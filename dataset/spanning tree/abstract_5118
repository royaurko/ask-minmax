We study the $su(2)$ conformal field theory in its spinon description,
adapted to the Yangian invariance. By evaluating the action of the Yangian
generators on the primary fields, we find a new connection between this
conformal field theory and the Calogero-Sutherland model with $su(2)$ spin. We
use this connection to describe how the spinons are the quasi-particles
spanning the irreducible Yangian multiplet, and also to exhibit operators
creating the $N$-spinon highest weight vectors.
