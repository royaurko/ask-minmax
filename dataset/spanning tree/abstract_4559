We perform a numerical study of the interaction of a high-intensity laser
pulse with a nano-structured target. In particular, we study a target where the
nano-structuring increases the absorption rate as compared to the flat target
case. The transport of electrons within the target, and in particular in the
nano-structure, is analysed. It is shown that it is indeed possible, using a
terawatt class laser, to light up a nano-scale Christmas tree. Due to the form
of the tree we achieve very strong edge fields, in particular at the top where
the star is located. Such edge fields, as here located at ion rich spots, makes
strong acceleration gradients possible. It also results in a nice, warm glow
suitable for the holiday season.
