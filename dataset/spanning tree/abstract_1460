The goal of this paper is to study the similarity between sequences using a
distance between the \emph{context} trees associated to the sequences. These
trees are defined in the framework of \emph{Sparse Probabilistic Suffix Trees}
(SPST), and can be estimated using the SPST algorithm. We implement the
Phyl-SPST package to compute the distance between the sparse context trees
estimated with the SPST algorithm. The distance takes into account the
structure of the trees, and indirectly the transition probabilities. We apply
this approach to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of protein sequences in the
globin family of vertebrates. We compare this tree with the one obtained using
the well-known PAM distance.
