We study models of stabilization near large complex structure in type IIB
O3/O7 flux compactifications. We consider a special family of examples with a
single nonvanishing Yukawa coupling in the large complex structure limit, which
allows us to study all possible stable vacua of the tree-level no-scale
potential very explicitly. We find that, by tuning fluxes, both supersymmetric
and nonsupersymmetric vacua can be realized at almost any point in the large
complex structure moduli space of one-, two-, and three-parameter models. We
also consider the effects of stringy corrections on tree-level vacua. We argue
quite generally that, in certain regimes, both supersymmetric and
nonsupersymmetric tree-level vacua could serve as consistent, controllable
foundations for full stabilization beyond tree level (including Kahler moduli),
leading to either AdS or dS cosmological constants. We show how to achieve
these regimes in our models. Finally, we discuss some implications of
minimizing at tree level the no-scale form of the scalar potential, versus
other potentials used in statistical studies.
