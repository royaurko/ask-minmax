Interval graphs are intersection graphs of closed intervals of the real-line.
The well-known computational problem, called recognition, asks whether an input
graph $G$ can be represented by closed intervals, i.e., whether $G$ is an
interval graph. There are several linear-time algorithms known for recognizing
interval graphs, the oldest one is by Booth and Lueker [J. Comput. System Sci.,
13 (1976)] based on PQ-trees.
  In this paper, we study a generalization of recognition, called partial
representation extension. The input of this problem consists of a graph $G$
with a partial representation $\cal R'$ fixing the positions of some intervals.
The problem asks whether it is possible to place the remaining interval and
create an interval representation $\cal R$ of the entire graph $G$ extending
$\cal R'$. We generalize the characterization of interval graphs by Fulkerson
and Gross [Pac. J. Math., 15 (1965)] to extendible partial representations.
Using it, we give a linear-time algorithm for partial representation extension
based on a reordering problem of PQ-trees.
