The Large Scale Structure in the galaxy distribution is investigated using
The First Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using the Minimal
Spanning Tree technique we have extracted sets of filaments, of wall--like
structures, of galaxy groups, and of rich clusters from this unique sample. The
physical properties of these structures were then measured and compared with
the statistical expectations based on the Zel'dovich' theory.
  The measured characteristics of galaxy walls were found to be consistent with
those for a spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with
$\Omega_m\approx$ 0.3 and $\Omega_\Lambda \approx$ 0.7, and for Gaussian
initial perturbations with a Harrison -- Zel'dovich power spectrum.
Furthermore, we found that the mass functions of groups and of unrelaxed
structure elements generally fit well with the expectations from Zel'dovich'
theory. We also note that both groups and rich clusters tend to prefer the
environments of walls, which tend to be of higher density, rather than the
environments of filaments, which tend to be of lower density.
