Noncommutative geometry is used to study the local geometry of ultrametric
spaces and the geometry of trees at infinity. Connes's example of the
noncommutative space of Penrose tilings is interpreted as a non-Hausdorff orbit
space of a compact, ultrametric space under the action of its local isometry
group. This is generalized to compact, locally rigid, ultrametric spaces. The
local isometry types and the local similarity types in those spaces can be
analyzed using groupoid C^*-algebras.
  The concept of a locally rigid action of a countable group \Gamma on a
compact, ultrametric space by local similarities is introduced. It is proved
that there is a faithful unitary representation of \Gamma into the germ
groupoid C^*-algebra of the action. The prototypical example is the standard
action of Thompson's group V on the ultrametric Cantor set. In this case, the
C^*-algebra is the Cuntz algebra O_2 and representations originally due to
Birget and Nekrashevych are recovered.
  End spaces of trees are sources of ultrametric spaces. Some connections are
made between locally rigid, ultrametric spaces and a concept in the theory of
tree lattices of Bass and Lubotzky.
