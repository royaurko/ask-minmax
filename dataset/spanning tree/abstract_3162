We introduce the notions of tree-like path and tree-like equivalence between
paths and prove that the latter is an equivalence relation for paths of finite
length. We show that the equivalence classes form a group with some similarity
to a free group, and that in each class there is one special tree reduced path.
The set of these paths is the Reduced Path Group. It is a continuous analogue
to the group of reduced words. The signature of the path is a power series
whose coefficients are definite iterated integrals of the path. We identify the
paths with trivial signature as the tree-like paths, and prove that two paths
are in tree-like equivalence if and only if they have the same signature. In
this way, we extend Chen's theorems on the uniqueness of the sequence of
iterated integrals associated with a piecewise regular path to finite length
paths and identify the appropriate extended meaning for reparameterisation in
the general setting. It is suggestive to think of this result as a
non-commutative analogue of the result that integrable functions on the circle
are determined, up to Lebesgue null sets, by their Fourier coefficients. As a
second theme we give quantitative versions of Chen's theorem in the case of
lattice paths and paths with continuous derivative, and as a corollary derive
results on the triviality of exponential products in the tensor algebra.
