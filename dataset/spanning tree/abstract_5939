In this article we extend the mean value property for harmonic functions to
the nonharmonic case. In order to get the value of the function at the center
of a sphere one should integrate a certain Laplace operator power series over
the sphere. We write explicitly such series in the Euclidean case and in the
case of infinite homogeneous trees.
