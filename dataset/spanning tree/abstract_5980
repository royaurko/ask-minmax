We study a hybrid tree-finite difference method which permits to obtain
efficient and accurate European and American option prices in the Heston
Hull-White and Heston Hull-White2d models. Moreover, as a by-product, we
provide a new simulation scheme to be used for Monte Carlo evaluations.
Numerical results show the reliability and the efficiency of the proposed
methods
