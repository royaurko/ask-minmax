Aluthge transform of a bounded operator is generalized to the case of
unbounded one. A formula for the Aluthge transform of a weighted shift on a
directed tree is established and it is used to construct an example of a
hyponormal operator whose Aluthge transform has trivial domain. It is proven
that such an example can be also constructed in the class of composition
operators. It is also shown that Aluthge transform of a closed, densely defined
operator is not necessarily closable.
