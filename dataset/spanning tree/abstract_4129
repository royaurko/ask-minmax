Starting with two coupled Bethe-Salpeter equations for the quark-antiquark,
and for the quark-glue-antiquark component of the quarkonium, we solve the
bound state equations perturbatively. The resulting admixture of glue can be
partially understood in a semiclassical way, one has, however, to take care of
the different use of time ordered versus retarded Green functions. Subtle
questions concerning the precise definition of the equal time wave function
arise, because the wave function for the Coulomb gluon is discontinuous with
respect to the relative time of the gluon. A striking feature is that a one
loop non abelian graph contributes to the same order as tree graphs, because
the couplings of transverse gluons in the tree graphs are suppressed in the non
relativistic bound state, while the higher order loop graph can couple to
quarks via non suppressed Coulomb gluons. We also calculate the amplitude for
quark and antiquark at zero distance in the quark-glue-antiquark component of
the P-state. This quantity is of importance for annihilation decays of
P-states. It shows a remarkable compensation between the tree graph and the non
abelian loop graph contribution. An extension of our results to include non
perturbative effects is possible.
