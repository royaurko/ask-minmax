A Skolem sequence is a linear arrangement of the multiset, {1, 1, 2, 2, ...,
n, n} such that if r in [n] appears in positions i and j, then |i-j| = r. We
first translate the problem to a particular set of perfect matchings, then
apply the method of generating trees for open arc diagrams to generate
exhaustively all Skolem sequences of a given size. Tracking the arc length
between pairs of vertices in an arc annotated diagram is the central task.
Although we do not surpass previously known enumerative results, this method
drastically reduces the search space compared to previously known methods.
