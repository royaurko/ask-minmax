We study alternating register automata on data words and data trees in
relation to logics. A data word (resp. data tree) is a word (resp. tree) whose
every position carries a label from a finite alphabet and a data value from an
infinite domain. We investigate one-way automata with alternating control over
data words or trees, with one register for storing data and comparing them for
equality. This is a continuation of the study started by Demri, Lazic and
Jurdzinski. From the standpoint of register automata models, this work aims at
two objectives: (1) simplifying the existent decidability proofs for the
emptiness problem for alternating register automata; and (2) exhibiting
decidable extensions for these models. From the logical perspective, we show
that (a) in the case of data words, satisfiability of LTL with one register and
quantification over data values is decidable; and (b) the satisfiability
problem for the so-called forward fragment of XPath on XML documents is
decidable, even in the presence of DTDs and even of key constraints. The
decidability is obtained through a reduction to the automata model introduced.
This fragment contains the child, descendant, next-sibling and
following-sibling axes, as well as data equality and inequality tests.
