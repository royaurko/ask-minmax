We show how the tree level unitarity violations of compactified extra
dimensional extensions of the Standard Model become much stronger when the
scalar sector is included in the bulk. This effect occurs when the couplings
are not suppressed for larger Kaluza-Klein levels, and could have relevant
consequences for the phenomenology of the next generation of colliders. We also
introduce a simple and generic formalism to obtain unitarity bounds for finite
energies, taking into account coupled channels including the towers of
Kaluza-Klein excitations.
