The notion of a braided chord diagram is introduced and studied. An
equivalence relation is given which identifies all braidings of a fixed chord
diagram. It is shown that finite-type invariants are stratified by braid index
for knots which can be represented as closed 3-braids. Partial results are
obtained about spanning sets for the algebra of chord diagrams of braid index
3.
