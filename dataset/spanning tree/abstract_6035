A Kuranishi space is a topological space with a Kuranishi structure, defined
by Fukaya and Ono. Kuranishi structures occur naturally on moduli spaces of
J-holomorphic curves in symplectic geometry.
  Let Y be an orbifold and R a commutative ring or Q-algebra. We define two
kinds of Kuranishi homology KH_*(Y;R). The chain complex KC_*(Y;R) defining
KH_*(Y;R) is spanned over R by [X,f,G], for X a compact oriented Kuranishi
space with corners, f : X --> Y smooth, and G "gauge-fixing data" which makes
Aut(X,f,G) finite. Our main result is that these are isomorphic to singular
homology. We define Poincare dual Kuranishi cohomology, isomorphic to
compactly-supported cohomology.
  We define five kinds of Kuranishi (co)bordism spanned by isomorphism
classes[X,f] for X a compact oriented Kuranishi space without boundary and f :
X --> Y smooth. They are new topological invariants, and we show they are very
large. These theories are powerful new tools in symplectic geometry. Defining
virtual cycles and chains for moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves is trivial
in Kuranishi (co)homology. There is no need to perturb moduli spaces, and no
problems with transversality. This gives major simplifications in Lagrangian
Floer cohomology.
  We define new Gromov-Witten type invariants in Kuranishi bordism, over Z not
Q. We sketch how these may be used to prove the integrality conjecture for
Gopakumar-Vafa invariants.
