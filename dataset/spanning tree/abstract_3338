We introduce an algebra which describes the multiplication structure of a
family of q-series containing a q-analogue of multiple zeta values. The double
shuffle relations are formulated in our framework. They contain a q-analogue of
Hoffman's identity for multiple zeta values. We also discuss the dimension of
the space spanned by the linear relations realized in our algebra.
