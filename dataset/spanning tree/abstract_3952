In the high-energy limit, we compute the gauge-invariant three-parton forward
clusters, which in the BFKL theory constitute the tree parts of the NNLO impact
factors. In the triple collinear limit, we obtain the polarized
double-splitting functions. For the unpolarized and the spin-correlated
double-splitting functions, our results agree with the ones obtained by
Campbell-Glover and Catani-Grazzini, respectively. In addition, we compute the
four-gluon forward cluster, which in the BFKL theory forms the tree part of the
NNNLO gluonic impact factor. In the quadruple collinear limit we obtain the
unpolarized triple-splitting functions, while in the limit of a three-parton
central cluster we derive the Lipatov vertex for the production of three
gluons, relevant for the calculation of a BFKL ladder at NNLL accuracy.
Finally, motivated by the reorganization of the color in the high-energy limit,
we introduce a color decomposition of the purely gluonic tree amplitudes in
terms of the linearly independent subamplitudes only.
