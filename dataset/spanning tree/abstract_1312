Karloff? and Shirley recently proposed summary trees as a new way to
visualize large rooted trees (Eurovis 2013) and gave algorithms for generating
a maximum-entropy k-node summary tree of an input n-node rooted tree. However,
the algorithm generating optimal summary trees was only pseudo-polynomial (and
worked only for integral weights); the contributors left open existence of a
olynomial-time algorithm. In addition, the contributors provided an additive
approximation algorithm and a greedy heuristic, both working on real weights.
This paper shows how to construct maximum entropy k-node summary trees in time
O(k^2 n + n log n) for real weights (indeed, as small as the time bound for the
greedy heuristic given previously); how to speed up the approximation algorithm
so that it runs in time O(n + (k^4/eps?) log(k/eps?)), and how to speed up the
greedy algorithm so as to run in time O(kn + n log n). Altogether, these
results make summary trees a much more practical tool than before.
