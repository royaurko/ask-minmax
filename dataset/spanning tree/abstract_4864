We study the energy minimization problem for an elastic interface in a random
potential plus a quadratic well. As the position of the well is varied, the
ground state undergoes jumps, called shocks or static avalanches. We introduce
an efficient and systematic method to compute the statistics of avalanche sizes
and manifold displacements. The tree-level calculation, i.e. mean-field limit,
is obtained by solving a saddle-point equation. Graphically, it can be
interpreted as a the sum of all tree graphs. The 1-loop corrections are
computed using results from the functional renormalization group. At the upper
critical dimension the shock statistics is described by the Brownian Force
model (BFM), the static version of the so-called ABBM model in the
non-equilibrium context of depinning. This model can itself be treated exactly
in any dimension and its shock statistics is that of a Levy process. Contact is
made with classical results in probability theory on the Burgers equation with
Brownian initial conditions. In particular we obtain a functional extension of
an evolution equation introduced by Carraro and Duchon, which recursively
constructs the tree diagrams in the field theory.
