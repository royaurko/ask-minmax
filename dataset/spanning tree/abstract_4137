The spin-4/3 fractional superstring is characterized by a world-sheet chiral
algebra involving spin-4/3 currents. The discussion of the tree-level
scattering amplitudes of this theory presented in hepth/9310131 is expanded to
include amplitudes containing two twisted-sector states. These amplitudes are
shown to satisfy spurious state decoupling. The restriction to only two
external twisted-sector states is due to the absence of an appropriate
dimension-one vertex describing the emission of a single twisted-sector state.
This is analogous to the ``old covariant'' formalism of ordinary superstring
amplitudes in which an appropriate dimension-one vertex for the emission of a
Ramond-sector state is lacking. Examples of tree scattering amplitudes are
calculated in a c=5 model of the spin-4/3 chiral algebra realized in terms of
free bosons on the string world-sheet. The target space of this model is
three-dimensional flat Minkowski space-time and the twisted-sector physical
states are fermions in space-time. Since the critical central charge of the
spin-4/3 fractional superstring theory is 10, this c=5 model is not consistent
at the string loop level.
