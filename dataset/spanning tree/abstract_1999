The advent of synoptic sky surveys has spurred the development of techniques
for real-time classification of astronomical sources in order to ensure timely
follow-up with appropriate instruments. Previous work has focused on algorithm
selection or improved light curve representations, and naively convert light
curves into structured feature sets without regard for the time span or phase
of the light curves. In this paper, we highlight the violation of a fundamental
machine learning assumption that occurs when archival light curves with long
observational time spans are used to train classifiers that are applied to
light curves with fewer observations. We propose two solutions to deal with the
mismatch in the time spans of training and test light curves. The first is the
use of classifier committees where each classifier is trained on light curves
of different observational time spans. Only the committee member whose training
set matches the test light curve time span is invoked for classification. The
second solution uses hierarchical classifiers that are able to predict source
types both individually and by sub-group, so that the user can trade-off an
earlier, more robust classification with classification granularity. We test
both methods using light curves from the MACHO survey, and demonstrate their
usefulness in improving performance over similar methods that naively train on
all available archival data.
