We present exact results for the critical behavior of the RFIM on complete
graphs and trees, both at equilibrium and away from equilibrium, i.e., models
for hysteresis and Barkhausen noise. We show that for stretched exponential and
power law distributions of random fields the behavior on complete graphs is
non-universal, while the behavior on Cayley trees is universal even in the
limit of large co-ordination.
