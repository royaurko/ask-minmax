We show that three fixed point structures equipped with (sequential)
composition, a sum operation, and a fixed point operation share the same valid
equations. These are the theories of (context-free) languages, (regular) tree
languages, and simulation equivalence classes of (regular) synchronization
trees (or processes). The results reveal a close relationship between classical
language theory and process algebra.
