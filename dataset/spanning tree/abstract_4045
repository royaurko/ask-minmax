We investigate schema languages for unordered XML having no relative order
among siblings. First, we propose unordered regular expressions (UREs),
essentially regular expressions with unordered concatenation instead of
standard concatenation, that define languages of unordered words to model the
allowed content of a node (i.e., collections of the labels of children).
However, unrestricted UREs are computationally too expensive as we show the
intractability of two fundamental decision problems for UREs: membership of an
unordered word to the language of a URE and containment of two UREs.
Consequently, we propose a practical and tractable restriction of UREs,
disjunctive interval multiplicity expressions (DIMEs).
  Next, we employ DIMEs to define languages of unordered trees and propose two
schema languages: disjunctive interval multiplicity schema (DIMS), and its
restriction, disjunction-free interval multiplicity schema (IMS). We study the
complexity of the following static analysis problems: schema satisfiability,
membership of a tree to the language of a schema, schema containment, as well
as twig query satisfiability, implication, and containment in the presence of
schema. Finally, we study the expressive power of the proposed schema languages
and compare them with yardstick languages of unordered trees (FO, MSO, and
Presburger constraints) and DTDs under commutative closure. Our results show
that the proposed schema languages are capable of expressing many practical
languages of unordered trees and enjoy desirable computational properties.
