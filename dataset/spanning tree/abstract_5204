The ground-state energy of the doubly magic nuclei 4He and 16O has been
calculated within the framework of the Goldstone expansion starting from modern
nucleon-nucleon potentials. A low-momentum potential V-low-k has been derived
from the bare potential by integrating out its high-momentum components beyond
a cutoff Lambda. We have employed a simple criterion to relate this cutoff
momentum to a boundary condition for the two-nucleon model space spanned by a
harmonic-oscillator basis. Convergence of the results has been obtained with a
limited number of oscillator quanta.
