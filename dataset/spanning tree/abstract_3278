A configuration of lattice vectors is supernormal if it contains a Hilbert
basis for every cone spanned by a subset. We study such configurations from
various perspectives, including triangulations, integer programming and
Groebner bases. Our main result is a bijection between virtual chambers of the
configuration and virtual initial ideals of the associated binomial ideal.
