The relationship between solar activity and the global climate is not only an
academically interesting issue, but also an important problem for human beings.
Lean and Rind have analyzed a considerable amount of climate data from around
the world from 1889 to 2006. According to their analysis, the global effect was
estimated to be 0.17 plus-minus 0.01K between the solar maximum and minimum.
However, they noticed that the effect strongly appeared in the zones between
70N and 30N, and between 25S and 50S. At its peak latitude (near 40), the
effect was estimated to be 0.5 K. Therefore, we analyzed a tree that survived
at the Murooji temple in Nara prefecture (34d32mN, 136d2mE) Japan, for 391
years.
  Quite surprisingly, Fourier analysis of the annual growth rate identified two
cycles with periodicities of 12 and 25 years during the Maunder minimum. We
have continued the analysis, using different samples from the Nagusa shrine in
Hyogo Prefecture, Itayanagi City, Aomori Prefecture, Japan, and from Yaku
Island in Kyusyu, Japan. An evidence of solar activity was found in all of the
samples. In particular, we have discovered a correlation between Swiss glacier
fluctuation and the growth rate of the Yaku tree ring.
