In our article "A tree of linearisable second-order evolution equations by
generalised hodograph transformations" [J. Nonlin. Math. Phys. {\bf 8} (2001),
342-362] we presented a tree of linearisable (C-integrable) second-order
evolution equations in (1+1) dimensions. Expanding this result we report here
the complete set of recursion operators for this tree and present several
linearisable (C-integrable) hierarchies in (1+1) dimensions.
