We provide the first formal foundation of SAND attack trees which are a
popular extension of the well-known attack trees. The SAND attack tree
formalism increases the expressivity of attack trees by introducing the
sequential conjunctive operator SAND. This operator enables the modeling of
ordered events.
  We give a semantics to SAND attack trees by interpreting them as sets of
series-parallel graphs and propose a complete axiomatization of this semantics.
We define normal forms for SAND attack trees and a term rewriting system which
allows identification of semantically equivalent trees. Finally, we formalize
how to quantitatively analyze SAND attack trees using attributes.
