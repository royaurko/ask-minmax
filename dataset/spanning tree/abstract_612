We extend some of the fundamental results about percolation on unimodular
nonamenable graphs to nonunimodular graphs. We show that they cannot have
infinitely many infinite clusters at critical Bernoulli percolation. In the
case of heavy clusters, this result has already been established, but it also
follows from one of our results. We give a general necessary condition for
nonunimodular graphs to have a phase with infinitely many heavy clusters. We
present an invariant spanning tree with $p_c=1$ on some nonunimodular graph.
Such trees cannot exist for nonamenable unimodular graphs. We show a new way of
constructing nonunimodular graphs that have properties more peculiar than the
ones previously known.
