We report the first experimental characterization of the first-order
continuous variable orbital angular momentum states. Using a spatially
non-degenerate optical parametric oscillator (OPO) we produce quadrature
entanglement between the two first-order Laguerre-Gauss modes. The family of
OAM modes is mapped on an orbital Poincare sphere, and the modes position on
the sphere is spanned by the three orbital parameters. Using the non-degenerate
OPO we produce squeezing of these parameters, and as an illustration, we
reconstruct the "cigar-shaped" uncertainty volume on the orbital Poincare
sphere.
