As an alternative to the usual Feynman graphs, tree amplitudes in Yang-Mills
theory can be constructed from tree graphs in which the vertices are tree level
MHV scattering amplitudes, continued off shell in a particular fashion. The
formalism leads to new and relatively simple formulas for many amplitudes, and
can be heuristically derived from twistor space.
