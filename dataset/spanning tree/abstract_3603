We study the planted ensemble of locked constraint satisfaction problems. We
describe the connection between the random and planted ensembles. The use of
the cavity method is combined with arguments from reconstruction on trees and
first and second moment considerations; in particular the connection with the
reconstruction on trees appears to be crucial. Our main result is the location
of the hard region in the planted ensemble. In a part of that hard region
instances have with high probability a single satisfying assignment.
