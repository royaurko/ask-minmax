We show that a glass transition, signaled by a peak in the specific heat vs.
temperature, can occur because a glassy system that shows no signs of aging
progresses so slowly through the energy landscape that the time needed to
obtain an accurate estimate of the thermodynamic averages exceeds the
observation time. We find that below the glass transition temperature of a
three dimensional binary mixture of soft spheres, the specific heat increases
with measurement time spans orders of magnitude longer than previously
recognized equilibration times.
