Given a recursive distributional equation (RDE) and a solution $\mu$ of it,
we consider the tree indexed invariant process called the recursive tree
process (RTP) with marginal $\mu$. We introduce a new type of bivariate
uniqueness property which is different from the one defined by Aldous and
Bandyopadhyay (2005), and we prove that this property is equivalent to
tail-triviality for the RTP, thus obtaining a necessary and sufficient
condition to determine tail-triviality for a RTP in general. As an application
we consider Aldous' (2000) construction of the frozen percolation process on a
infinite regular tree and show that the associated RTP has a trivial tail.
