One can construct continuous deformations of groups by embedding a discrete
group acting on a tree into the automorphism group over the infinite projective
space. We verify a phenomena that any deformations by a class of Hamiltonian
diffeomorphisms must be uniformly infinite in our sense. In particular there
are no finite deformation in the class. As an application of moduli theory over
the infinite dimensional spaces, we obtain a new inequality between cobordism
invariant and iteration norms.
