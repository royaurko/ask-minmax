We describe the topological structure and the underlying organization
principles of the directories created by users of a computer cluster when
storing his/her own files. We analyze degree distributions, average distance
between files, distribution of communities and allometric scaling exponents of
the directory trees. We find that users create trees with a broad, scale-free
degree distribution. The structure of the directories is well captured by a
growth model with a single parameter. The degree distribution of the different
trees has a non-universal exponent associated with different values of the
parameter of the model. However, the distribution of community sizes has a
universal exponent analytically obtained from our model.
