We investigate the construction of tree-level MHV gluon amplitudes in
multiplet bases using BCFW recursion. The multiplet basis decomposition can
either be obtained by decomposing results derived in (for example) the DDM
basis or by formulating the recursion directly in the multiplet basis. We focus
on the latter approach and show how to efficiently deal with the color
structure appearing in the recursion. For illustration, we also explicitly
calculate the four-, five- and six-gluon amplitudes.
