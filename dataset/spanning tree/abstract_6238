By shining a hypermultiplet from one side of the bulk of a flat
five-dimensional orbifold, supersymmetry can be broken by boundary conditions.
The extra dimension is stabilized in a supersymmetric way, and by computing the
four-dimensional effective potential for the radion it is shown that
supersymmetry breaking does not damage our radius stabilization mechanism. The
low energy theory contains the radion and two complex scalars that are massless
in the global supersymmetric limit and are stabilized by tree level
supergravity effects. It is shown that radion mediation can play the dominant
role in communicating supersymmetry breaking to the visible sector. It is also
shown that at tree level, contact terms are exponentially suppressed.
