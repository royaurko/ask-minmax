In 1986 Harer and Zagier computed a certain matrix integral to determine an
influential closed-form formula for the number of (orientable) one-face maps on
n vertices colored from N colors. Kerov (1997) provided a proof which computed
the same matrix integral differently, which gave an interpretation of these
numbers as also counting the number of placements of non-attacking rooks on
Young diagrams. Bernardi (2010) provided a bijective proof of this formula by
putting one-face maps in bijection with tree-rooted maps, which are orientable
maps with a designated spanning tree. In the first part of the paper, we
explore the connection between these rook placements and tree-rooted maps by
developing a bijection between these objects. Rook placements on Young diagrams
have a q-analogue due to Garsia and Remmel (1986). In the second part of the
paper, we propose a statistic on rook placements that leads to a conjectured
identity which is a q-analogue of part of the Harer-Zagier formula. This
identity is also expressed in terms of moments of orthogonal polynomials which
are rescaling of q-Hermite polynomials. We then use these moments to give a
recurrence for the proposed q-analogue.
