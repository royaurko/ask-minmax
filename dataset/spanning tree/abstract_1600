This text is based on a lecture for the Sheffield Probability Day; its main
purpose is to survey some recent asymptotic results about Bernoulli bond
percolation on certain large random trees with logarithmic height. We also
provide a general criterion for the existence of giant percolation clusters in
large trees, which answers a question raised by David Croydon.
