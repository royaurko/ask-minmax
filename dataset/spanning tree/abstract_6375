We extend the Fermilab method for heavy quarks to include interactions of
dimensions 6 and 7 in the action. There are, in general, many new interactions,
but we carry out the calculations needed to match the lattice action to
continuum QCD at the tree level, finding six non-zero couplings. Using the
heavy-quark theory of cutoff effects, we estimate how large the remaining
discretization errors are. We find that our tree-level matching, augmented with
one-loop matching of the dimension-five interactions, can bring these errors
below 1%, at currently available lattice spacings.
