The effect of Eulerian intermittency on the Lagrangian statistics of relative
dispersion in fully developed turbulence is investigated. A scaling range
spanning many decades is achieved by generating a multi-affine synthetic
velocity field with prescribed intermittency features. The scaling laws for the
Lagrangian statistics are found to depend on Eulerian intermittency in
agreement with a multifractal description. As a consequence of the Kolmogorov's
law, the Richardson's law for the variance of pair separation is not affected
by intermittency corrections.
