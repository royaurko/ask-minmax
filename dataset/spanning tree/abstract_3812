We derive a recursive formula for the alpha'-expansion of superstring tree
amplitudes involving any number N of massless open string states. String
corrections to Yang-Mills field theory are shown to enter through the Drinfeld
associator, a generating series for multiple zeta values. Our results apply for
any number of spacetime dimensions or supersymmetries and chosen helicity
configurations.
