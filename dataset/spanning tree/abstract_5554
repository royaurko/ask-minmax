A pseudo-hyperoval of a projective space $\PG(3n-1,q)$, $q$ even, is a set of
$q^n+2$ subspaces of dimension $n-1$ such that any three span the whole space.
We prove that a pseudo-hyperoval with an irreducible transitive stabiliser is
elementary. We then deduce from this result a classification of the thick
generalised quadrangles $\mathcal{Q}$ that admit a point-primitive,
line-transitive automorphism group with a point-regular abelian normal
subgroup. Specifically, we show that $\mathcal{Q}$ is flag-transitive and
isomorphic to $T_2^*(\mathcal{H})$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is either the regular
hyperoval of $\PG(2,4)$ or the Lunelli--Sce hyperoval of $\PG(2,16)$.
