This paper investigates the birth-death ("B-D" for short) process on tree
with continuous time, emphasizing on estimating the principal eigenvalue
(equivalently, the convergence rate) of the process with Dirichlet boundary at
the unique root 0. Three kinds of variational formulas for the eigenvalue are
presented. As an application, we obtain a criterion for positivity of the first
eigenvalue for B-D processes on tree with one branch after some layer.
