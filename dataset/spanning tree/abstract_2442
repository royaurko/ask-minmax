We consider two axioms of second-order arithmetic. These axioms assert, in
two different ways, that infinite but narrow binary trees always have infinite
paths. We show that both axioms are strictly weaker than Weak K\"onig's Lemma,
and incomparable in strength to the dual statement (WWKL) that wide binary
trees have paths.
