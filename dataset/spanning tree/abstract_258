We consider three probability measures on subsets of edges of a given finite
graph $G$, namely those which govern, respectively, a uniform forest, a uniform
spanning tree, and a uniform connected subgraph. A conjecture concerning the
negative association of two edges is reviewed for a uniform forest, and a
related conjecture is posed for a uniform connected subgraph. The former
conjecture is verified numerically for all graphs $G$ having eight or fewer
vertices, or having nine vertices and no more than eighteen edges, using a
certain computer algorithm which is summarised in this paper. Negative
association is known already to be valid for a uniform spanning tree. The three
cases of uniform forest, uniform spanning tree, and uniform connected subgraph
are special cases of a more general conjecture arising from the random-cluster
model of statistical mechanics.
