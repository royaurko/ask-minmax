The whole computer hardware industry embraced multicores. For these machines,
the extreme optimisation of sequential algorithms is no longer sufficient to
squeeze the real machine power, which can be only exploited via thread-level
parallelism. Decision tree algorithms exhibit natural concurrency that makes
them suitable to be parallelised. This paper presents an approach for
easy-yet-efficient porting of an implementation of the C4.5 algorithm on
multicores. The parallel porting requires minimal changes to the original
sequential code, and it is able to exploit up to 7X speedup on an Intel
dual-quad core machine.
