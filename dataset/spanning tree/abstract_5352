We investigate the dynamics of nanoscale droplets in the vicinity of chemical
steps which separate parts of a substrate with different wettabilities. Due to
long-ranged dispersion forces, nanodroplets positioned on one side of the step
perceive the different character of the other side even at some distances from
the step, leading to a dynamic response. The direction of the ensuing motion of
such droplets does not only depend on the difference between the equilibrium
contact angles on these two parts but in particular on the difference between
the corresponding Hamaker constants. Therefore the motion is not necessarily
directed towards the more wettable side and can also be different from that of
droplets which span the step.
