We show that trees of manifolds, the topological spaces introduced by
Jakobsche, appear as boundaries at infinity of various spaces and groups. In
particular, they appear as Gromov boundaries of some hyperbolic groups, of
arbitrary dimension, obtained by the procedure of strict hyperbolization. We
also recognize these spaces as boundaries of arbitrary Coxeter groups with
manifold nerves, and as Gromov boundaries of the fundamental groups of singular
spaces obtained from some finite volume hyperbolic manifolds by cutting off
their cusps and collapsing the resulting boundary tori to points.
