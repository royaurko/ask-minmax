The Yule process generates a class of binary trees which is fundamental to
population genetic models and other applications in evolutionary biology. In
this paper, we introduce a family of sub-classes of ranked trees, called
Omega-trees, which are characterized by imbalance of internal nodes. The degree
of imbalance is defined by an integer 0 <= w. For caterpillars, the extreme
case of unbalanced trees, w = 0. Under models of neutral evolution, for
instance the Yule model, trees with small w are unlikely to occur by chance.
Indeed, imbalance can be a signature of permanent selection pressure, such as
observable in the genealogies of certain pathogens. From a mathematical point
of view it is interesting to observe that the space of Omega-trees maintains
several statistical invariants although it is drastically reduced in size
compared to the space of unconstrained Yule trees. Using generating functions,
we study here some basic combinatorial properties of Omega-trees. We focus on
the distribution of the number of subtrees with two leaves. We show that
expectation and variance of this distribution match those for unconstrained
trees already for very small values of w.
