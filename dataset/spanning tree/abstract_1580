The aim of this note is to show how the introduction of certain tableaux,
called Catalan alternative tableaux, provides a very simple and elegant
description of the product in the Hopf algebra of binary trees defined by Loday
and Ronco. Moreover, we use this description to introduce a new associative
product on the space of binary trees.
