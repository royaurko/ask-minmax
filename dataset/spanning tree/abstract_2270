Phylogenetic invariants are certain polynomials in the joint probability
distribution of a Markov model on a phylogenetic tree. Such polynomials are of
theoretical interest in the field of algebraic statistics and they are also of
practical interest--they can be used to construct phylogenetic trees. This
paper is a self-contained introduction to the algebraic, statistical, and
computational challenges involved in the practical use of phylogenetic
invariants. We survey the relevant literature and provide some partial answers
and many open problems.
