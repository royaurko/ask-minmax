We prove that every Lipschitz function from a subset of a locally compact
length space to a metric tree has a unique absolutely minimal Lipschitz
extension (AMLE). We relate these extensions to a stochastic game called {\bf
Politics} - a generalization of a game called {\bf Tug of War} that has been
used in \cite{PSSW09} to study real-valued AMLEs.
