The complexity of a graph can be obtained as a derivative of a variation of
the zeta function or a partial derivative of its generalized characteristic
polynomial evaluated at a point [\textit{J. Combin. Theory Ser. B}, 74 (1998),
pp. 408--410]. A similar result for the weighted complexity of weighted graphs
was found using a determinant function [\textit{J. Combin. Theory Ser. B}, 89
(2003), pp. 17--26]. In this paper, we consider the determinant function of two
variables and discover a condition that the weighted complexity of a weighted
graph is a partial derivative of the determinant function evaluated at a point.
Consequently, we simply obtain the previous results and disclose a new formula
for the Bartholdi zeta function. We also consider a new weighted complexity,
for which the weights of spanning trees are taken as the sum of weights of
edges in the tree, and find a similar formula for this new weighted complexity.
As an application, we compute the weighted complexities of the product of the
complete graphs.
