We consider the complexity of equivalence and learning for multiplicity tree
automata, i.e., weighted tree automata over a field. We first show that the
equivalence problem is logspace equivalent to polynomial identity testing, the
complexity of which is a longstanding open problem. Secondly, we derive lower
bounds on the number of queries needed to learn multiplicity tree automata in
Angluin's exact learning model, over both arbitrary and fixed fields.
  Habrard and Oncina (2006) give an exact learning algorithm for multiplicity
tree automata, in which the number of queries is proportional to the size of
the target automaton and the size of a largest counterexample, represented as a
tree, that is returned by the Teacher. However, the smallest
tree-counterexample may be exponential in the size of the target automaton.
Thus the above algorithm does not run in time polynomial in the size of the
target automaton, and has query complexity exponential in the lower bound.
  Assuming a Teacher that returns minimal DAG representations of
counterexamples, we give a new exact learning algorithm whose query complexity
is quadratic in the target automaton size, almost matching the lower bound, and
improving the best previously-known algorithm by an exponential factor.
