We extend Goldie's (1991) Implicit Renewal Theorem to enable the analysis of
recursions on weighted branching trees. We illustrate the developed method by
deriving the power tail asymptotics of the distributions of the solutions R to:
R =_D sum_{i=1}^N C_i R_i + Q, R =_D max(max_{i=1}^N C_i R_i, Q), and similar
recursions, where (Q, N, C_1,..., C_N) is a nonnegative random vector with N in
{0, 1, 2, 3, ..., infinity}, and {R_i}_{i >= 1} are iid copies of R,
independent of (Q, N, C_1,..., C_N); =_D denotes the equality in distribution.
