The analysis of extensive numerical data for the percolation probabilities of
incipient spanning clusters in two dimensional percolation at criticality are
presented. We developed an effective code for the single-scan version of the
Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm. We measured the probabilities on the square lattice
forming samples of rectangular strips with widths from 8 to 256 sites and
lengths up to 3200 sites. At total of more than $10^{15}$ random numbers are
generated for the sampling procedure. Our data confirm the proposed exact
formulaes for the probability exponents conjectured recently on the base of 2D
conformal field theory. Some preliminary results for 3D percolation are also
discussed.
