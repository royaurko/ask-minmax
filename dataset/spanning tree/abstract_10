We introduce a new technique to associate a spanning tree to the average
linkage cluster analysis. We term this tree as the Average Linkage Minimum
Spanning Tree. We also introduce a technique to associate a value of
reliability to links of correlation based graphs by using bootstrap replicas of
data. Both techniques are applied to the portfolio of the 300 most capitalized
stocks traded at New York Stock Exchange during the time period 2001-2003. We
show that the Average Linkage Minimum Spanning Tree recognizes economic sectors
and sub-sectors as communities in the network slightly better than the Minimum
Spanning Tree does. We also show that the average reliability of links in the
Minimum Spanning Tree is slightly greater than the average reliability of links
in the Average Linkage Minimum Spanning Tree.
