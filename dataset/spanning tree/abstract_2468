A layerwise search in a split-by-edges tree (as defined by Br{\ae}ndeland,
2015) of agiven graph produces a maximum independent set in exponential time. A
depth-first search produces an independent set, which may or may not be a
maximum, in linear time, but the worst case success rate is maybe not high
enough to make it really interesting. What may make depth-first searching in
split-by-edges trees interesting, though, is the pronounced oscillation of its
success rate along the graph size axis.
