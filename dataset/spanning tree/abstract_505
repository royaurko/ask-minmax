We use Polyak's skein relation to give a new proof that Milnor's string link
homotopy invariants are finite type invariants, and to develop a recursive
relation for their associated weight systems. We show that the obstruction to
the triviality of these weight systems is the presence of a certain kind of
spanning tree in the intersection graph of a chord diagram.
