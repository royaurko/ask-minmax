json2run is a tool to automate the running, storage and analysis of
experiments. The main advantage of json2run is that it allows to describe a set
of experiments concisely as a JSON-formatted parameter tree. It also supports
parallel execution of experiments, automatic parameter tuning through the
F-Race framework and storage and analysis of experiments with MongoDB and R.
