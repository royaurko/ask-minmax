Simulations of four-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory are performed with
partial axial gauge fixing trees spanning three of the four dimensions. The
remaining SU(2) gauge symmetry, global in three directions and local in one, is
found to break spontaneously at weak coupling, with the average
fourth-dimension-pointing link in each perpendicular hyperplane as order
parameter. The symmetry is restored at strong coupling. Symmetry breaking in
each hyperplane appears to be independent, and occurs regardless of boundary
conditions. The associated phase transition is likely coincident with the
Polyakov loop transition.
