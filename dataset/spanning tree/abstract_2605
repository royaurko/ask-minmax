We present a protocol for verification of ``no such entry'' replies from
databases. We introduce a new cryptographic primitive as the underlying
structure, the keyed hash tree, which is an extension of Merkle's hash tree. We
compare our scheme to Buldas et al.'s Undeniable Attesters and Micali et al.'s
Zero Knowledge Sets.
