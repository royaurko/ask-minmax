We present Spitzer IRAC and MIPS observations of the star-forming region
containing intermediate-mass young stellar object (YSO) AFGL 490. We supplement
these data with near-IR 2MASS photometry and with deep SQIID observations off
the central high extinction region. We have more than doubled the known
membership of this region to 57 Class I and 303 Class II YSOs via the combined
1-24 um photometric catalog derived from these data. We construct and analyze
the minimum spanning tree of their projected positions, isolating one locally
over-dense cluster core containing 219 YSOs (60.8% of the region's members). We
find this cluster core to be larger yet less dense than similarly analyzed
clusters. Although the structure of this cluster core appears irregular, we
demonstrate that the parsec-scale surface densities of both YSOs and gas are
correlated with a power law slope of 2.8, as found for other similarly analyzed
nearby molecular clouds. We also explore the mass segregation implications of
AFGL 490's offset from the center of its core, finding that it has no apparent
preferential central position relative to the low-mass members.
