We investigate clique trees of infinite locally finite chordal graphs. Our
key tool is a bijection between the set of clique trees and the product of
local families of finite trees. We enumerate the clique trees of a chordal
graph and extend various classic characterisations of clique trees to the
infinite setting. We use our improved structural knowledge to show that the
single colour marginal of a symmetric, 1-dependent and proper vertex colouring
of a chordal graph is always a block factor. A perfect Lov\'asz Local Lemma on
chordal graphs is a direct consequence of this probabilistic construction.
