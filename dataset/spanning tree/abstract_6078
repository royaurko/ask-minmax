Some dynamical properties present in a problem concerning the acceleration of
particles in a wave packet are studied. The dynamics of the model is described
in terms of a two-dimensional area preserving map. We show that the phase space
is mixed in the sense that there are regular and chaotic regions coexisting. We
use a connection with the standard map in order to find the position of the
first invariant spanning curve which borders the chaotic sea. We find that the
position of the first invariant spanning curve increases as a power of the
control parameter with the exponent 2/3. The standard deviation of the kinetic
energy of an ensemble of initial conditions obeys a power law as a function of
time, and saturates after some crossover. Scaling formalism is used in order to
characterize the chaotic region close to the transition from integrability to
nonintegrability and a relationship between the power law exponents is derived.
The formalism can be applied in many different systems with mixed phase space.
Then, dissipation is introduced into the model and therefore the property of
area preservation is broken, and consequently attractors are observed. We show
that after a small change of the dissipation, the chaotic attractor as well as
its basin of attraction are destroyed, thus leading the system to experience a
boundary crisis. The transient after the crisis follows a power law with
exponent -2.
