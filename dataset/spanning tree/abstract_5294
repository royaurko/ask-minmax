Time-resolved and temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements on
one-dimensional sexithiophene lattices reveal intrinsic branching of
photoexcitations to two distinct species: self-trapped excitons and dark
charge-transfer excitons (CTX; > 5% yield), with radii spanning 2-3 sites. The
significant CTX yield results from the strong charge-transfer character of the
Frenkel exciton band due to the large free exciton bandwidth (~400 meV) in
these supramolecular nanostructures.
