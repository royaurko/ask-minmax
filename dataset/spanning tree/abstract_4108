The advances in WDM technology lead to the great interest in traffic grooming
problems. As traffic often changes from time to time, the problem of grooming
dynamic traffic is of great practical value. In this paper, we discuss dynamic
grooming of traffic in star and tree networks. A genetic algorithm (GA) based
approach is proposed to support arbitrary dynamic traffic patterns, which
minimizes the number of ADM's and wavelengths. To evaluate the algorithm,
tighter bounds are derived. Computer simulation results show that our algorithm
is efficient in reducing both the numbers of ADM's and wavelengths in tree and
star networks.
