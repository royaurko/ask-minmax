We describe simple properties of some soups of unoriented Markov loops and of
some soups of oriented Markov loops that can be interpreted as a spatial Markov
property of these loop-soups. This property of the latter soup is related to
well-known features of the uniform spanning trees (such as Wilson's algorithm)
while the Markov property of the former soup is related to the Gaussian Free
Field and to identities used in the foundational papers of Symanzik, Nelson,
and of Brydges, Fr\"ohlich and Spencer or Dynkin, or more recently by Le Jan.
