We consider the following Markovian dynamic on point processes: at constant
rate and with equal probability, either the rightmost atom of the current
configuration is removed, or a new atom is added at a random distance from the
rightmost atom. Interpreting atoms as limit buy orders, this process was
introduced by Lakner et al. [preprint] to model a one-sided limit order book.
We consider this model in the regime where the total number of orders converges
to a reflected Brownian motion, and complement the results of Lakner et al. by
showing that, in the case where the mean displacement at which a new order is
added is positive, the measure-valued process describing the whole limit order
book converges to a simple functional of this reflected Brownian motion.
  The cornerstone of our approach is the regenerative characterization of
L\'evy trees proved in Weill [Ann. Prob. 2007], which provides an elegant and
intuitive proof strategy which we unfold. Moreover, the proofs rely on new
results of independent interest on branching random walks with a barrier.
