We investigate weak recognizability of deterministic languages of infinite
trees. We prove that for deterministic languages the Borel hierarchy and the
weak index hierarchy coincide. Furthermore, we propose a procedure computing
for a deterministic automaton an equivalent minimal index weak automaton with a
quadratic number of states. The algorithm works within the time of solving the
emptiness problem.
