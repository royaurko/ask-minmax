We use the infrared consistency of one-loop amplitudes in N=4 Yang-Mills
theory to derive a compact analytic formula for a tree-level NNMHV gluon
scattering amplitude in QCD, the first such formula known. We argue that the IR
conditions, coupled with recent advances in calculating one-loop box
coefficients, can give a new tool for computing tree-level amplitudes in
general. Our calculation suggests that many amplitudes have a structure which
is even simpler than that revealed so far by current twistor-space
constructions.
