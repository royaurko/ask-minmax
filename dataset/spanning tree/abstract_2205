The probability distribution P(k) of the sizes k of critical trees (branching
ratio m=1) is well known to show a power-law behavior k^(-3/2). Such behavior
corresponds to the mean-field approximation for many critical and
self-organized critical phenomena. Here we show numerically and analytically
that also supercritical trees (branching ration m>1) are "critical" in that
their size distribution obeys a power-law k^(-2). We mention some possible
applications of these results.
