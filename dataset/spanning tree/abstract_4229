In Image Compression, the researchers' aim is to reduce the number of bits
required to represent an image by removing the spatial and spectral
redundancies. Recently discrete wavelet transform and wavelet packet has
emerged as popular techniques for image compression. The wavelet transform is
one of the major processing components of image compression. The result of the
compression changes as per the basis and tap of the wavelet used. It is
proposed that proper selection of mother wavelet on the basis of nature of
images, improve the quality as well as compression ratio remarkably. We suggest
the novel technique, which is based on wavelet packet best tree based on
Threshold Entropy with enhanced run-length encoding. This method reduces the
time complexity of wavelet packets decomposition as complete tree is not
decomposed. Our algorithm selects the sub-bands, which include significant
information based on threshold entropy. The enhanced run length encoding
technique is suggested provides better results than RLE. The result when
compared with JPEG-2000 proves to be better.
