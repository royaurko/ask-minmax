Data compression has been widely applied in many data processing areas.
Compression methods use variable-size codes with the shorter codes assigned to
symbols or groups of symbols that appear in the data frequently. Fibonacci
coding, as a representative of these codes, is used for compressing small
numbers. Time consumption of a decompression algorithm is not usually as
important as the time of a compression algorithm. However, efficiency of the
decompression may be a critical issue in some cases. For example, a real-time
compression of tree data structures follows this issue. Tree's pages are
decompressed during every reading from a secondary storage into the main
memory. In this case, the efficiency of a decompression algorithm is extremely
important. We have developed a Fast Fibonacci decompression for this purpose.
Our approach is up to $3.5\times$ faster than the original implementation.
