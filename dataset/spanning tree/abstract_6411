Arkani-Hamed, Cachazo, Cheung and Kaplan have proposed a Grassmannian
formulation for the S-matrix of N=4 Yang-Mills as an integral over link
variables. In parallel work, the connected prescription for computing tree
amplitudes in Witten's twistor string theory has also been written in terms of
link variables. In this paper we extend the six- and seven-point results of
arXiv:0909.0229 and arXiv:0909.0499 by providing a simple analytic proof of the
equivalence between the two formulas for all tree-level NMHV superamplitudes.
Also we note that a simple deformation of the connected prescription integrand
gives directly the ACCK Grassmannian integrand in the limit when the
deformation parameters equal zero.
