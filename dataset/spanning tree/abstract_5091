The spacetime singularities inside realistic black holes are sometimes
thought to be spacelike and strong, since there is a generic class of solutions
(BKL) to Einsteins equations with these properties. We show that null, weak
singularities are also generic, in the following sense: there is a class of
vacuum solutions containing null, weak singularities, depending on 8 arbitrary
(up to some inequalities) analytic initial functions of 3 spatial coordinates.
Since 8 arbitrary functions are needed (in the gauge used here) to span the
generic solution, this class can be regarded as generic.
