This paper defines a generalization of the Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebra,
$\h(1)$ that contains the entire Hopf algebra of rooted trees. A relationship
between the former, a much studied object in non-commutative geometry, and the
later, a much studied object in perturbative Quantum Field Theory, has been
established by Connes and Kreimer. The results of this paper open the door to
study the cohomology of the Hopf algebra of rooted trees.
