This document describes how to use the XML static analyzer in practice. It
provides informal documentation for using the XML reasoning solver
implementation. The solver allows automated verification of properties that are
expressed as logical formulas over trees. A logical formula may for instance
express structural constraints or navigation properties (like e.g. path
existence and node selection) in finite trees. Logical formulas can be
expressed using the syntax of XPath expressions, DTD, XML Schemas, and Relax NG
definitions.
