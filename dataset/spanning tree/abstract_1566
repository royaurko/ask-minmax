In previous work, we defined the intersection graph of a chord diagram
associated with a string link (as in the theory of finite type invariants). In
this paper, we look at the case when this graph is a tree, and we show that in
many cases these trees determine the chord diagram (modulo the usual 1-term and
4-term relations).
