The parity decision tree model extends the decision tree model by allowing
the computation of a parity function in one step. We prove that the
deterministic parity decision tree complexity of any Boolean function is
polynomially related to the non-deterministic complexity of the function or its
complement. We also show that they are polynomially related to an analogue of
the block sensitivity. We further study parity decision trees in their
relations with an intermediate variant of the decision trees, as well as with
communication complexity.
