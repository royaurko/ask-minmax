We use here the results on the influence graph by Boissonnat et al. to adapt
them for particular cases where additional information is available. In some
cases, it is possible to improve the expected randomized complexity of
algorithms from O(n log n) to O(n log star n).
  This technique applies in the following applications: triangulation of a
simple polygon, skeleton of a simple polygon, Delaunay triangulation of points
knowing the EMST (euclidean minimum spanning tree).
