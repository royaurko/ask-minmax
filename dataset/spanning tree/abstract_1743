The automatic generation of decision trees based on off-line reasoning on
models of a domain is a reasonable compromise between the advantages of using a
model-based approach in technical domains and the constraints imposed by
embedded applications. In this paper we extend the approach to deal with
temporal information. We introduce a notion of temporal decision tree, which is
designed to make use of relevant information as long as it is acquired, and we
present an algorithm for compiling such trees from a model-based reasoning
system.
