We report on the extension of the data fitting considering the QCD inspired
model based on the summation of gluon ladders applied to the $ep$ scattering.
In lines of a two Pomeron approach, the structure function $F_2$ has a hard
piece given by the model and the remaining soft contribution: a soft Pomeron
and non-singlet content. In this contribution, we carefully estimate the
relative role of the hard and the soft pieces from a global fit in a large span
of $x$ and $Q^2$.
