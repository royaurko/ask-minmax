We consider the complexity of the firefighter problem where b>=1 firefighters
are available at each time step. This problem is proved NP-complete even on
trees of degree at most three and budget one (Finbow et al.,2007) and on trees
of bounded degree b+3 for any fixed budget b>=2 (Bazgan et al.,2012). In this
paper, we provide further insight into the complexity landscape of the problem
by showing that the pathwidth and the maximum degree of the input graph govern
its complexity. More precisely, we first prove that the problem is NP-complete
even on trees of pathwidth at most three for any fixed budget b>=1. We then
show that the problem turns out to be fixed parameter-tractable with respect to
the combined parameter "pathwidth" and "maximum degree" of the input graph.
