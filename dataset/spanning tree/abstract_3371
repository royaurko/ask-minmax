The behaviors of coupled oscillators, each of which has periodic motion with
random natural frequency in the absence of coupling, are investigated. Some
novel collective phenomena are revealed. At the onset of instability of the
phase-locking state, simultaneous phase slips of all oscillators and quantized
phase shifts in these phase slips are observed. By incresing the coupling, a
bifurcation tree from high-dimensional quasiperiodicity to chaos to
quasiperiodicity and periodicity is found. Different orders of phase
synchronizations of chaotic oscillators and chaotic clusters play the key role
for constructing this tree structure.
