We show that the upper bound on the lightest Higgs mass in the MSSM is
relaxed by introducing a singlet which couples to the Higgs fields, even at a
large tan beta region, preferable for explaining the muon anomalous magnetic
moment. In the models of a singlet extension, it is known that the upper bound
is relaxed by a tree-level contribution, especially at small tan beta region.
For large tan beta, however, the requirement for the perturbativity on the
singlet-Higgs coupling up to the GUT scale prevents the lightest Higgs from
obtaining a large tree-level mass. We construct an explicit UV complete model
which allows large singlet-Higgs coupling at low energy without disturbing the
perturbativity. The UV completion can be applied for any singlet extension of
the MSSM. Moreover, we point out that the radiative correction from the
singlet-Higgs coupling becomes dominant, and the lightest Higgs mass can be
easily as heavy as 130 GeV if this coupling is large enough even for large tan
beta.
