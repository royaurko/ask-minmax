We characterise finite and infinitesimal rigidity for bar-joint frameworks in
R^d with respect to polyhedral norms (i.e. norms with closed unit ball P a
convex d-dimensional polytope). Infinitesimal and continuous rigidity are shown
to be equivalent for finite frameworks in R^d which are well-positioned with
respect to P. An edge-labelling determined by the facets of the unit ball and
placement of the framework is used to characterise infinitesimal rigidity in
R^d in terms of monochrome spanning trees. An analogue of Laman's theorem is
obtained for all polyhedral norms on R^2.
