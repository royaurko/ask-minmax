A method for solving the shell-model eigenproblem in a severely truncated
space, spanned by properly selected correlated states obtained by partitioning
the full configuration space, is proposed. The method describes in a
practically exact way the low energy spectroscopic properties of nuclei, as
exemplified in schematic models. The applicability of the method to heavy
nuclei as well in contexts different from the nuclear shell model is stressed
