This project began as a collection of handouts attempting to provide a
slightly more in depth theoretical background to the first year labs performed
at University College Dublin. Over time, these handouts were patched together,
and this book (if it can be called a book) emerged. The book is intended to
complement the University College Dublin first year laboratory manuals, but can
also be read independently. The UCD labs span a wide range of subjects, and
consequently so do the chapters of this book, beginning with experimental
techniques, moving onto classical mechanics, touching on E&M, and ending with a
variety of more advanced topics.
