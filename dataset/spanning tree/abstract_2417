A scale-multiplicative semigroup in a totally disconnected, locally compact
group $G$ is one for which the restriction of the scale function on $G$ is
multiplicative. The maximal scale-multiplicative semigroups in groups acting
2-transitively on the set of ends of trees without leaves are determined in
this paper and shown to correspond to geometric features of the tree.
