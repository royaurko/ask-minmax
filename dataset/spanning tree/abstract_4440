Existing approaches to the synthesis of reactive systems typically involve
the construction of transition systems such as Mealy automata. However, in
order to obtain a succinct representation of the desired system, structured
programs can be a more suitable model. In 2011, Madhusudan proposed an
algorithm to construct a structured reactive program for a given omega-regular
specification without synthesizing a transition system first. His procedure is
based on two-way alternating omega-automata on finite trees that recognize the
set of "correct" programs.
  We present a more elementary and direct approach using only deterministic
bottom-up tree automata that compute so-called signatures for a given program.
In doing so, we extend Madhusudan's results to the wider class of programs with
bounded delay, which may read several input symbols before producing an output
symbol (or vice versa). As a formal foundation, we inductively define a
semantics for such programs.
