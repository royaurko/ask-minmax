We propose a method that combines signals from many brain regions observed in
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to predict the subject's behavior
during a scanning session. Such predictions suffer from the huge number of
brain regions sampled on the voxel grid of standard fMRI data sets: the curse
of dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction is thus needed, but it is often
performed using a univariate feature selection procedure, that handles neither
the spatial structure of the images, nor the multivariate nature of the signal.
By introducing a hierarchical clustering of the brain volume that incorporates
connectivity constraints, we reduce the span of the possible spatial
configurations to a single tree of nested regions tailored to the signal. We
then prune the tree in a supervised setting, hence the name supervised
clustering, in order to extract a parcellation (division of the volume) such
that parcel-based signal averages best predict the target information.
Dimensionality reduction is thus achieved by feature agglomeration, and the
constructed features now provide a multi-scale representation of the signal.
Comparisons with reference methods on both simulated and real data show that
our approach yields higher prediction accuracy than standard voxel-based
approaches. Moreover, the method infers an explicit weighting of the regions
involved in the regression or classification task.
