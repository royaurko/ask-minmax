We study a problem of model selection for data produced by two different
context tree sources. Motivated by linguistic questions, we consider the case
where the probabilistic context trees corresponding to the two sources are
finite and share many of their contexts. In order to understand the differences
between the two sources, it is important to identify which contexts and which
transition probabilities are specific to each source.
  We consider a class of probabilistic context tree models with three types of
contexts: those which appear in one, the other, or both sources. We use a BIC
penalized maximum likelihood procedure that jointly estimates the two sources.
  We propose a new algorithm which efficiently computes the estimated context
trees. We prove that the procedure is strongly consistent. We also present a
simulation study showing the practical advantage of our procedure over a
procedure that works separately on each dataset.
