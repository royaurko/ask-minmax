Trigonometric invariants are defined for each Weyl group orbit on the root
lattice. They are real and periodic on the coroot lattice. Their polynomial
algebra is spanned by a basis which is calculated by means of an algorithm. The
invariants of the basis can be used as coordinates in any cell of the coroot
space and lead to an exactly solvable model of Sutherland type. We apply this
construction to the $F_4$ case
