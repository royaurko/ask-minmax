We study the spectrum of random operators on a large class of trees. These
trees have finitely many cone types and they can be constructed by a
substitution rule. The random operators are perturbations of Laplace type
operators either by random potentials or by random hopping terms, i.e.,
perturbations of the off-diagonal elements. We prove stability of arbitrary
large parts of the absolutely continuous spectrum for sufficiently small but
extensive disorder.
