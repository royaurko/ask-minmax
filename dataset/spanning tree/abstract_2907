To untangle a geometric graph means to move some of the vertices so that the
resulting geometric graph has no crossings. Pach and Tardos [Discrete Comput.
Geom., 2002] asked if every n-vertex geometric planar graph can be untangled
while keeping at least n^\epsilon vertices fixed. We answer this question in
the affirmative with \epsilon=1/4. The previous best known bound was
\Omega((\log n / \log\log n)^{1/2}). We also consider untangling geometric
trees. It is known that every n-vertex geometric tree can be untangled while
keeping at least (n/3)^{1/2} vertices fixed, while the best upper bound was
O(n\log n)^{2/3}. We answer a question of Spillner and Wolff [arXiv:0709.0170
2007] by closing this gap for untangling trees. In particular, we show that for
infinitely many values of n, there is an n-vertex geometric tree that cannot be
untangled while keeping more than 3(n^{1/2}-1) vertices fixed. Moreover, we
improve the lower bound to (n/2)^{1/2}.
