We present two models of multitype Galton-Watson trees, that we call full
binary trees and full binary trees with survivals. We show relevant relations
between these trees and the Narayana numbers and the two-dimensional
decompositions of integers. We prove further statistical results on our models
concerning the related contour processes and offspring distributions.
