In this paper, we obtain upper bounds for the geometric Ramsey numbers of
trees. We prove that $R_c(T_n,H_m)=(n-1)(m-1)+1$ if $T_n$ is a caterpillar and
$H_m$ is a Hamiltonian outerplanar graph on $m$ vertices. Moreover, if $T_n$
has at most two non-leaf vertices, then $R_g(T_n,H_m)=(n-1)(m-1)+1$. We also
prove that $R_c(T_n,H_m)=O(n^2m)$ and $R_g(T_n,H_m)=O(n^3m^2)$ if $T_n$ is an
arbitrary tree on $n$ vertices and $H_m$ is an outerplanar triangulation with
pathwidth 2. %Further, we prove a uniform polynomial upper bound for the
geometric Ramsey numbers of caterpillars and we also give an upper bound for
$R_g(T_n)$ where $T_n$ is an arbitrary tree.
