We present a new technique to synthesize high-power single-cycle pulses in
the visible and ultraviolet ranges by coherent superposition of a multiband
octave-spanning spectrum obtained by highly-nondegenerate cascaded four-wave
mixing of femtosecond pulses in bulk isotropic nonresonant media. The
generation of coherent spectra spanning over two octaves in bandwidth is
experimentally demonstrated using a thin fused silica slide. Full
characterization of the intervening multicolored fields using
frequency-resolved optical gating, where multiple cascaded orders have been
measured simultaneously for the first time, supports the possibility of direct
synthesis of near-single-cycle 2.2 fs visible-UV pulses without recurring to
complex amplitude or phase control, which should enable many applications in
science and technology.
