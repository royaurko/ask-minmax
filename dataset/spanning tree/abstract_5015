Power spectra of the light curves of semiregular variables, based on visual
magnitude estimates spanning many decades, show clear evidence for stochastic
excitation. This supports the suggestion by Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (2001)
that oscillations in these stars are solar-like, i.e., stochastically excited
by convection, with mode lifetimes ranging from years to decades.
