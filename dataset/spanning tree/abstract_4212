Every encoding has priori information if the encoding represents any semantic
information of the unverse or object. Encoding means mapping from the unverse
to the string or strings of digits. The semantic here is used in the
model-theoretic sense or denotation of the object. If encoding or strings of
symbols is the adequate and true mapping of model or object, and the mapping is
recursive or computable, the distance between two strings (text) is mapping the
distance between models. We then are able to measure the distance by computing
the distance between the two strings. Otherwise, we may take a misleading
course. "Language tree" may not be a family tree in the sense of historical
linguistics. Rather it just means the similarity.
