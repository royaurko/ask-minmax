We prove that the isomorphism of scattered tree automatic linear orders as
well as the existence of automorphisms of scattered word automatic linear
orders are undecidable. For the existence of automatic automorphisms of word
automatic linear orders, we determine the exact level of undecidability in the
arithmetical hierarchy.
