We study the asymptotic behavior of random simply generated noncrossing
planar trees in the space of compact subsets of the unit disk, equipped with
the Hausdorff distance. Their distributional limits are obtained by
triangulating at random the faces of stable laminations, which are random
compact subsets of the unit disk made of non-intersecting chords coded by
stable L\'evy processes. We also study other ways to "fill-in" the faces of
stable laminations, which leads us to introduce the iteration of laminations
and of trees.
