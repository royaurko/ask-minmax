The width measure \emph{treedepth}, also known as vertex ranking, centered
coloring and elimination tree height, is a well-established notion which has
recently seen a resurgence of interest. We present an algorithm which---given
as input an $n$-vertex graph, a tree decomposition of the graph of width $w$,
and an integer $t$---decides Treedepth, i.e. whether the treedepth of the graph
is at most $t$, in time $2^{O(wt)} \cdot n$. If necessary, a witness structure
for the treedepth can be constructed in the same running time. In conjunction
with previous results we provide a simple algorithm and a fast algorithm which
decide treedepth in time $2^{2^{O(t)}} \cdot n$ and $2^{O(t^2)} \cdot n$,
respectively, which do not require a tree decomposition as part of their input.
The former answers an open question posed by Ossona de Mendez and Nesetril as
to whether deciding Treedepth admits an algorithm with a linear running time
(for every fixed $t$) that does not rely on Courcelle's Theorem or other heavy
machinery. For chordal graphs we can prove a running time of $2^{O(t \log
t)}\cdot n$ for the same algorithm.
