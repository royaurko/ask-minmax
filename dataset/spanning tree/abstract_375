We analyze the convergence of the spectrum of large random graphs to the
spectrum of a limit infinite graph. We apply these results to graphs converging
locally to trees and derive a new formula for the Stieljes transform of the
spectral measure of such graphs. We illustrate our results on the uniform
regular graphs, Erdos-Renyi graphs and preferential attachment graphs. We
sketch examples of application for weighted graphs, bipartite graphs and the
uniform spanning tree of n vertices.
