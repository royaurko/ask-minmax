The flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNC) are derived at tree level if the
electroweak gauge group depends on the fermion family, which are absent in the
standard model. We study the lepton flavour violation (LFV) through the FCNC
interactions in a nonuniversal gauge interaction model where the third
generation fermions are subjected to the separate SU(2)$_L$ gauge group.
