A binary tanglegram is a pair <S,T> of binary trees whose leaf sets are in
one-to-one correspondence; matching leaves are connected by inter-tree edges.
For applications, for example in phylogenetics or software engineering, it is
required that the individual trees are drawn crossing-free. A natural
optimization problem, denoted tanglegram layout problem, is thus to minimize
the number of crossings between inter-tree edges.
  The tanglegram layout problem is NP-hard and is currently considered both in
application domains and theory. In this paper we present an experimental
comparison of a recursive algorithm of Buchin et al., our variant of their
algorithm, the algorithm hierarchy sort of Holten and van Wijk, and an integer
quadratic program that yields optimal solutions.
