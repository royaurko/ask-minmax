We provide a structural description of, and invariants for, maximum spanning
tree-packable graphs, i.e. those graphs G for which the edge connectivity of G
is equal to the maximum number of edge-disjoint spanning trees in G. These
graphs are of interest for the k-tree protocol of Itai and Rodeh [Inform. and
Comput. 79 (1988), 43-59].
