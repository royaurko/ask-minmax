In our previous works, we proposed a physically-inspired rule to organize the
data points into an in-tree (IT) structure, in which some undesired edges are
allowed to occur. By removing those undesired or redundant edges, this IT
structure is divided into several separate parts, each representing one
cluster. In this work, we seek to prevent the undesired edges from arising at
the source. Before using the physically-inspired rule, data points are at first
organized into a proximity graph which restricts each point to select the
optimal directed neighbor just among its neighbors. Consequently, separated
in-trees or clusters automatically arise, without redundant edges requiring to
be removed.
