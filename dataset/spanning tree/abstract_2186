We consider the question of interactive communication, in which two remote
parties perform a computation while their communication channel is
(adversarially) noisy. We extend here the discussion into a more general and
stronger class of noise, namely, we allow the channel to perform insertions and
deletions of symbols. These types of errors may bring the parties "out of
sync", so that there is no consensus regarding the current round of the
protocol.
  In this more general noise model, we obtain the first interactive coding
scheme that has a constant rate and resists noise rates of up to
$1/18-\varepsilon$. To this end we develop a novel primitive we name edit
distance tree code. The edit distance tree code is designed to replace the
Hamming distance constraints in Schulman's tree codes (STOC 93), with a
stronger edit distance requirement. However, the straightforward generalization
of tree codes to edit distance does not seem to yield a primitive that suffices
for communication in the presence of synchronization problems. Giving the
"right" definition of edit distance tree codes is a main conceptual
contribution of this work.
