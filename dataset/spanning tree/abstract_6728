We present results of a lattice QCD application of a coordinate space
renormalization scheme for the extraction of renormalization constants for
flavour non-singlet bilinear quark operators. The method consists in the
analysis of the small-distance behaviour of correlation functions in Euclidean
space and has several theoretical and practical advantages, in particular: it
is gauge invariant, easy to implement and has relatively low computational
cost. The values of renormalization constants in the X-space scheme can be
converted to the MSbar scheme via 4-loop continuum perturbative formulae. Our
results for $N_f=2$ maximally twisted mass fermions with tree-level Symanzik
improved gauge action are compared to the ones from the RI-MOM scheme and show
full agreement with this method.
