We show that the Gromov boundary of the free factor graph for the free group
Fn with n>2 generators is the space of equivalence classes of minimal very
small indecomposable projective Fn-trees without point stabilizer containing a
free factor equipped with a quotient topology. Here two such trees are
equivalent if the union of their metric completions with their Gromov
boundaries are Fn-equivariantly homeomorphic with respect to the observer's
topology. The boundary of the cyclic splitting graph is the space of
equivalence classes of trees which either are indecomposable or split as very
large graph of actions. The boundary of the free splitting graph is the space
of equivalence classes of trees which either are indecomposable or split as
large graph of actions.
