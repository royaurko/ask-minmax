A classic result in the study of spanners is the existence of light
low-stretch spanners for Euclidean spaces. These spanners ahve arbitrary low
stretch, and weight only a constant factor greater than that of the minimum
spanning tree of the points (with dependence on the stretch and Euclidean
dimention). A central open problem in this field asks whether other spaces
admit low weight spanners as well - for example metric space with low intrinsic
dimension - yet only a handful of results of this type are known.
  In this paper, we consider snowflake metric spaces of low intrinsic
dimension. The {\alpha}-snowflake of a metric (X,{\delta}) is the metric
(X,${\delta}^{\alpha}$) for 0<{\alpha}<1. By utilizing an approach completely
different than those used for Euclidean spaces, we demonstrate that snowflake
metrics admit light spanners. Further, we show that the spanner is of diameter
O($\log$n), a result not possible for Euclidean spaces. As an immediate
corollary to our spanner, we obtain dramatic improvments in algorithms for the
traveling salesman problem in this setting, achieving a polynomial-time
approximation scheme with near-linear runtime. Along the way, we show that all
${\ell}_p$ spaces admit light spanners, a result of interest in its own right.
