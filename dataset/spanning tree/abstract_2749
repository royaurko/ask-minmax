The phylogenetic tree space, introduced by Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann, is
a cone over a simplicial complex. In this short article, we construct this
complex from local gluings of classical polytopes, the associahedron and the
permutohedron. Its homotopy is also reinterpreted and calculated based on
polytope data.
