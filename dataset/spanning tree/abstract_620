We dedicate this paper to Sir John Kingman on his 70th Birthday. In modern
mathematical population genetics the ancestral history of a population of genes
back in time is described by John Kingman's coalescent tree. Classical and
modern approaches model gene frequencies by diffusion processes. This paper,
which is partly a review, discusses how coalescent processes are dual to
diffusion processes in an analytic and probabilistic sense. Bochner (1954) and
Gasper (1972) were interested in characterizations of processes with Beta
stationary distributions and Jacobi polynomial eigenfunctions. We discuss the
connection with Wright--Fisher diffusions and the characterization of these
processes. Subordinated Wright--Fisher diffusions are of this type. An Inverse
Gaussian subordinator is interesting and important in subordinated
Wright--Fisher diffusions and is related to the Jacobi Poisson Kernel in
orthogonal polynomial theory. A related time-subordinated forest of non-mutant
edges in the Kingman coalescent is novel.
