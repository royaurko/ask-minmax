It has recently been shown that any simple (i.e. nonintersecting) polygonal
chain in the plane can be reconfigured to lie on a straight line, and any
simple polygon can be reconfigured to be convex. This result cannot be extended
to tree linkages: we show that there are trees with two simple configurations
that are not connected by a motion that preserves simplicity throughout the
motion. Indeed, we prove that an $N$-link tree can have $2^{\Omega(N)}$
equivalence classes of configurations.
