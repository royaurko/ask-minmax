For graphs F and G an F-matching in G is a subgraph of G consisting of
pairwise vertex disjoint copies of F. The number of F-matchings in G is denoted
by s(F,G). We show that for every fixed positive integer m and every fixed tree
F, the probability that s(F,T_n) = 0 mod m, where T_n is a random labeled tree
with n vertices, tends to one exponentially fast as n grows to infinity. A
similar result is proven for induced F-matchings. This generalizes a recent
result of Wagner who showed that the number of independent sets in a random
labeled tree is almost surely a zero residue.
