We present the results of a J-band study of the HI-selected Arecibo Dual-Beam
Survey and Arecibo Slice Survey galaxy samples using the 2 Micron All-Sky
Survey data. We find that these galaxies span a wide range of stellar and gas
properties. However, despite the diversity within the samples, we find a very
tight correlation between luminosity and size in the J-band, similar to that we
previously found (Rosenberg & Schneider 2003) between the HI mass and size. We
also find that the correlation between the baryonic mass and the J-band
diameter is even tighter than between the baryonic mass and the rotational
velocity.
