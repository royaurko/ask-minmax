In this paper we study the resolution of a facet ideal associated with a
special class of simplicial complexes introduced by S. Faridi. These simplicial
complexes are called trees, and are a generalization (to higher dimensions) of
the concept of a tree in graph theory. We show that the Koszul homology of the
facet ideal I of a tree is generated by the homology classes of monomial
cycles, determine the projective dimension and the regularity of I if the tree
is 1-dimensional, show that the graded Betti numbers of I satisfy an
alternating sum property if the tree is connected in codimension 1, and
classify all trees whose facet ideal has a linear resolution.
