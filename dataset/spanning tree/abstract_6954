Multi-robot teams offer possibilities of improved performance and fault
tolerance, compared to single robot solutions. In this paper, we show how to
realize those possibilities when starting from a single robot system controlled
by a Behavior Tree (BT). By extending the single robot BT to a multi-robot BT,
we are able to combine the fault tolerant properties of the BT, in terms of
built-in fallbacks, with the fault tolerance inherent in multi-robot
approaches, in terms of a faulty robot being replaced by another one.
Furthermore, we improve performance by identifying and taking advantage of the
opportunities of parallel task execution, that are present in the single robot
BT. Analyzing the proposed approach, we present results regarding how mission
performance is affected by minor faults (a robot losing one capability) as well
as major faults (a robot losing all its capabilities). Finally, a detailed
example is provided to illustrate the approach.
