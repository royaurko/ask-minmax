We present a new pruning procedure on discrete trees by adding marks on the
nodes of trees. This procedure allows us to construct and study a tree-valued
Markov process $\{{\cal G}(u)\}$ by pruning Galton-Watson trees and an
analogous process $\{{\cal G}^*(u)\}$ by pruning a critical or subcritical
Galton-Watson tree conditioned to be infinite. Under a mild condition on
offspring distributions, we show that the process $\{{\cal G}(u)\}$ run until
its ascension time has a representation in terms of $\{{\cal G}^*(u)\}$. A
similar result was obtained by Aldous and Pitman (1998) in the special case of
Poisson offspring distributions where they considered uniform pruning of
Galton-Watson trees by adding marks on the edges of trees.
