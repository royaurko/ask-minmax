We have assembled a catalogue of relative ages, metallicities and abundance
ratios for about 150 local galaxies in field, group and cluster environments.
The galaxies span morphological types from cD and ellipticals, to late type
spirals. Ages and metallicities were estimated from high quality published
spectral line indices using Worthey & Ottaviani (1997) single stellar
population evolutionary models. The identification of galaxy age as a fourth
parameter in the fundamental plane (Forbes et al. 1998) is confirmed by our
larger sample of ages. We investigate trends between age and metallicity, and
with other physical parameters of the galaxies, such as ellipticity,
luminosity, and kinematic anisotropy. We demonstrate the existence of a galaxy
age-metallicity relation similar to that seen for local galactic disk stars,
whereby young galaxies have high metallicity, while old galaxies span a large
range in metallicities. We also investigate the influence of environment and
morphology on the galaxy age and metallicity, especially the predictions made
by semi-analytic hierarchical clustering models (HCM). We confirm that
non-cluster ellipticals are indeed younger on average than cluster ellipticals
as predicted by the HCM models. However we also find a trend for the more
luminous galaxies to have a higher [Mg/Fe] ratio than the lower luminosity
galaxies, which is opposite to the expectation from HCM models.
