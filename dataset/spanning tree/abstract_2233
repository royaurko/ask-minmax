We give a new formalism for pure gauge-theoretic scattering at tree-amplitude
level. We first describe a generalization of the Britto-Cachazo-Feng recursion
relation in which a significant restriction is removed. We then use twistor
diagrams to express all tree amplitudes in a form independent of helicity. A
formal procedure involving anticommuting elements is required. We illustrate
the results with specific calculations of interest, up to 8 interacting fields.
