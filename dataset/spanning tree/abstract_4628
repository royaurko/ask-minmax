The Skyrme energy density functional has been applied to the study of
heavy-ion fusion reactions. The barriers for fusion reactions are calculated by
the Skyrme energy density functional with proton and neutron density
distributions determined by using restricted density variational (RDV) method
within the same energy density functional together with semi-classical approach
known as the extended semi-classical Thomas-Fermi method. Based on the fusion
barrier obtained, we propose a parametrization of the empirical barrier
distribution to take into account the multi-dimensional character of real
barrier and then apply it to calculate the fusion excitation functions in terms
of barrier penetration concept. A large number of measured fusion excitation
functions spanning the fusion barriers can be reproduced well. The competition
between suppression and enhancement effects on sub-barrier fusion caused by
neutron-shell-closure and excess neutron effects is studied.
