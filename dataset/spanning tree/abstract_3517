We propose a natural, bivariate, generalization of the nonsingular similarity
relations considered by T. Fine. We also provide an enumeration formulae and a
generating tree for those relations. The latter allow us to give a new
bijection between 321-avoiding derangements and Fine sequences. Moreover, we
establish that two special cases are in a one-to-one correspondence with
subsets of permutations characterized by forbidden subsequences on the
symmetrical group. All our results are established using the technique of
generating tree, thus giving entirely bijective proofs.
