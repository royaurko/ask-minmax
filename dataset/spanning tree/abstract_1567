We consider stochastic processes indexed by the vertices of an infinite
binary tree having a simple recursive structure. The value at any vertex is
some fixed function of the values at the two daughter vertices together with
some independent innovation. Endogeny means the innovations are generating.
When endogeny does not hold there exist dynamics in which the innovations are
held fixed while some additional randomness on the boundary of the tree is
perturbed.
