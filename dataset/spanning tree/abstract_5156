We use the free entropy defined by D. Voiculescu to prove that the free group
factors can not be decomposed as closed linear spans of noncommutative
monomials in elements of nonprime subfactors or abelian $*$-subalgebras, if the
degrees of monomials have an upper bound depending on the number of generators.
The resulting estimates for the hyperfinite and abelian dimensions of free
group factors settle in the affirmative a conjecture of L. Ge and S. Popa (for
infinitely many generators).
