We investigate the number of red sites on the elastic and real backbone when
right at the percolation threshold a spanning cluster exists between two sites
at opposite faces of the lattice and found that it scales in the same way as in
the case of percolation between two plates. We also find out that the number of
common red sites scales similarly for both kinds of backbones for percolation
between pairs of sites on opposite faces of the lattice. Our statistics for
several quantities show that the the exponent for the elastic backbone
approaches the one of the full backbone as dimensionality is increased.
