The Hadamard transform of \cite{Hendy89a, Hendy89} provides a way to work
with stochastic models for sequence evolution without having to deal with the
complications of tree space and the graphical structure of trees. Here we
demonstrate that the transform can be expressed in terms of the familiar
$\bP[\bt] = e^{\bQ[\bt]}$ formula for Markov chains. The key idea is to study
the evolution of vectors of states, one vector entry for each taxa; we call
this the $n$-taxon process. We derive transition probabilities for the process.
Significantly, the findings show that tree-based models are indeed in the
family of (multi-variate) exponential distributions.
