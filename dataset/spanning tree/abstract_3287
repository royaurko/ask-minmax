In an earlier paper we had pointed out that Quantum Mechanical type effects
are seen at different scales in the macro universe also. In this paper we
obtain a rationale for this, which lies in the picture of bound material
systems, spanning a Compton wavelength type extent, separated by much larger
and relatively much less dense distances.
