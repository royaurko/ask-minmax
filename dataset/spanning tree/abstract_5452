We prove that the type A, level one, conformal blocks divisors on
$\bar{M}_{0,n}$ span a finitely generated, full-dimensional subcone of the nef
cone. Each such divisor induces a morphism from $\bar{M}_{0,n}$, and we
identify its image as a GIT quotient parameterizing configurations of points
supported on a flat limit of Veronese curves. We show how scaling GIT
linearizations gives geometric meaning to certain identities among conformal
blocks divisor classes. This also gives modular interpretations, in the form of
GIT constructions, to the images of the hyperelliptic and cyclic trigonal loci
in $\bar{M}_{g}$ under an extended Torelli map.
