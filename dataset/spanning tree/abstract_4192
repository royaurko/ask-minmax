Complex systems of polynomial equations have to be set up and solved
algebraically in order to obtain analytic solutions for maximum likelihood on
phylogenetic trees. This has restricted the types of systems previously
resolved to the simplest models - three and four taxa under a molecular clock,
with just two state characters. In this work we give, for the first time,
analytic solutions for a family of trees with four state characters, like
normal DNA or RNA. The model of substitution we use is the Jukes-Cantor model,
and the trees are on three taxa under molecular clock, namely rooted triplets.
  We employ a number of approaches and tools to solve this system: Spectral
methods (Hadamard conjugation), a new representation of variables (the path-set
spectrum), and algebraic geometry tools (the resultant of two polynomials). All
these, combined with heavy application of computer algebra packages (Maple),
let us derive the desired solution.
