In this paper, we study the Hausdorff dimension of a certain class of
laminations, called graph matchbox manifolds. These laminations are obtained as
suspensions of pseudogroup actions on the space of pointed trees, and can be
regarded as generalizations of suspensions of shift spaces. It is well-known
that full shifts have positive Hausdorff dimension. We show that the Hausdorff
dimension of the space of pointed trees is infinite.
  One of the applications of this result is to the problem of embeddings of
laminations into differentiable foliations of smooth manifolds. To admit such
an embedding, a lamination must satisfy at least the following two conditions:
first, it must admit a metric and a foliated atlas, such that the generators of
the holonomy pseudogroup, associated to the atlas, are bi-Lipschitz maps
relative to the metric. Second, it must admit an embedding into a manifold,
which is a bi-Lipschitz map. The space of graph matchbox manifolds is an
example of a lamination where the first condition is satisfied, and the second
one is not satisfied, with Hausdorff dimension of the space of pointed trees
being the obstruction to the existence of a bi-Lipschitz embedding.
