Although Breadth-First Search (BFS) has several advantages over Depth-First
Search (DFS) its prohibitive space requirements have meant that algorithm
designers often pass it over in favor of DFS. To address this shortcoming, we
introduce a theory of Efficient BFS (EBFS) along with a simple recursive
program schema for carrying out the search. The theory is based on dominance
relations, a long standing technique from the field of search algorithms. We
show how the theory can be used to systematically derive solutions to two graph
algorithms, namely the Single Source Shortest Path problem and the Minimum
Spanning Tree problem. The solutions are found by making small systematic
changes to the derivation, revealing the connections between the two problems
which are often obscured in textbook presentations of them.
