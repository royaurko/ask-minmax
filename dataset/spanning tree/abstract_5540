We explore a connection between the Finslerian area functional and
well-investigated Cartan functionals to prove new Bernstein theorems,
uniqueness and removability results for Finsler-minimal graphs, as well as
enclosure theorems and isoperimetric inequalities for minimal immersions in
Finsler spaces. In addition, we establish the existence of smooth
Finsler-minimal immersions spanning given extreme or graphlike boundary
contours.
