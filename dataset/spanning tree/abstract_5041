We describe the two projects by which we are assembling a database of near-IR
luminosities and direct oxygen abundances for both high- and low-mass
star-forming galaxies in the nearby Universe. This will eventually allow us to
construct the first reliable and homogeneous luminosity-metallicity relation,
to be compared to theoretical models of galactic evolution, and to the
relations for galaxies at higher redshifts.
