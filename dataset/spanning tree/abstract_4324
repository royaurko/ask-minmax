Parameterized algorithms are a very useful tool for dealing with NP-hard
problems on graphs. Yet, to properly utilize parameterized algorithms it is
necessary to choose the right parameter based on the type of problem and
properties of the target graph class. Tree-width is an example of a very
successful graph parameter, however it cannot be used on dense graph classes
and there also exist problems which are hard even on graphs of bounded
tree-width. Such problems can be tackled by using vertex cover as a parameter,
however this places severe restrictions on admissible graph classes.
  Michael Lampis has recently introduced neighborhood diversity, a new graph
parameter which generalizes vertex cover to dense graphs. Among other results,
he has shown that simple parameterized algorithms exist for a few problems on
graphs of bounded neighborhood diversity. Our article further studies this area
and provides new algorithms parameterized by neighborhood diversity for the
p-Vertex-Disjoint Paths, Graph Motif and Precoloring Extension problems -- the
latter two being hard even on graphs of bounded tree-width.
