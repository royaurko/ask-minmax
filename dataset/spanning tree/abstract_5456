The problem of electron transport by means of a dumbbell shaped shuttle in
strong Coulomb blockade regime is solved. The electrons may be shuttled only in
the cotunneling regime during the time spans when both shoulders of the shuttle
approach the metallic banks. The conventional Anderson-like tunneling model is
generalized for this case and the tunneling conductance is calculated in the
adiabatic regime of slow motion of the shuttle. Non-adiabatic corrections are
briefly discussed.
