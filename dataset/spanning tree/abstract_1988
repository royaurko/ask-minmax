The tight span, or injective envelope, is an elegant and useful construction
that takes a metric space and returns the smallest hyperconvex space into which
it can be embedded. The concept has stimulated a large body of theory and has
applications to metric classification and data visualisation. Here we introduce
a generalisation of metrics, called diversities, and demonstrate that the rich
theory associated to metric tight spans and hyperconvexity extends to a
seemingly richer theory of diversity tight spans and hyperconvexity.
