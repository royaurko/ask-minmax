The simulated matter distribution on large scales is studied using
core-sampling, cluster analysis, inertia tensor analysis, and minimal spanning
tree techniques. Seven simulations in large boxes for five cosmological models
with COBE normalized CDM-like power spectra are studied. The wall-like Super
Large Scale Structure with parameters similar to the observed one is found for
the OCDM and LCDM models with Omega_m h = 0.3 & 0.245. In these simulations,
the rich structure elements with a typical value for the largest extension of
\~(30 - 50) h^-1 Mpc incorporate ~40% of matter with overdensity of about 10
above the mean. These rich elements are formed due to the anisotropic nonlinear
compression of sheets with original size of ~(15 - 25) h^{-1} Mpc. They
surround low-density regions with a typical diameter ~(50 - 70) h^{-1} Mpc.
  The statistical characteristics of these structures are found to be
approximately consistent with observations and theoretical expectations. The
cosmological models with higher matter density \Omega_m=1 in CDM with
Harrison-Zeldovich or tilted power spectra cannot reproduce the characteristics
of the observed galaxy distribution due to the very strong disruption of the
rich structure elements. Another model with a broken scale invariant initial
power spectrum (BCDM) shows not enough matter concentration in the rich
structure elements.
