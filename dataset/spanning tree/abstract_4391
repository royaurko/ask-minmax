We numerically estimate a scale $\Lambda_{uni}$ at which tree-level unitarity
is violated in the $SO(5)\times U(1)_X$ gauge-Higgs unification model by
evaluating amplitudes for scattering of the longitudinal W bosons. The
scattering amplitudes take larger values in the warped spacetime than in the
flat spacetime, and take maximal values when $\theta_H=\pi/2$, where $\theta_H$
is the Wilson line phase along the extra dimension. We take into account not
only the elastic scattering but also possible inelastic scatterings in order to
estimate $\Lambda_{\rm uni}$. We found that $\Lambda_{\rm uni}\simeq 1.3m_{KK}$
in the warped spacetime, and $\Lambda_{\rm uni}\simeq 140m_{KK}$ in the flat
spacetime, where $m_{KK}$ is the Kaluza-Klein mass scale. The tree-level
unitarity is violated at $O(1TeV)$ for $\theta_H=\pi/2$ in the former case due
to the vanishing WWH coupling.
