The impact risk has been sharply curtailed for the largest km-sized Near
Earth Objects (NEOs) through a concerted period of observation spanning the
last decade. Thus the risk of impact has now migrated to the smaller and more
numerous members of the Near Earth Object (NEO) population. Characterization
and mitigation missions to these smaller objects become more complex from a
spacecraft operations perspective, even as the prospects for nudging such lower
mass bodies off course become more feasible. This paper details the challenges
for spacecraft operations at small bodies and indicates areas where more
research and analysis of this problem is needed.
