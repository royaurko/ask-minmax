New non-unitary representations of the SU(2) algebra are introduced for the
case of the Dirac equation with a Coulomb potential; an extra phase, needed to
close the algebra, is also introduced. The new representations does not require
integer or half integer labels. The set of operators defined are used to span
the complete space of bound state eigenstates of the problem thus solving it in
an essentially algebraic way.
