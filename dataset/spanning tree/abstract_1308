Based on solid theoretical foundations, we present strong evidences that a
number of real-life networks, taken from different domains like Internet
measurements, biological data, web graphs, social and collaboration networks,
exhibit tree-like structures from a metric point of view. We investigate few
graph parameters, namely, the tree-distortion and the tree-stretch, the
tree-length and the tree-breadth, the Gromov's hyperbolicity, the
cluster-diameter and the cluster-radius in a layering partition of a graph,
which capture and quantify this phenomenon of being metrically close to a tree.
By bringing all those parameters together, we not only provide efficient means
for detecting such metric tree-like structures in large-scale networks but also
show how such structures can be used, for example, to efficiently and compactly
encode approximate distance and almost shortest path information and to fast
and accurately estimate diameters and radii of those networks. Estimating the
diameter and the radius of a graph or distances between its arbitrary vertices
are fundamental primitives in many data and graph mining algorithms.
