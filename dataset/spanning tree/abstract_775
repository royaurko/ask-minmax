The main topic of these notes are Markov loops, studied in the context of
continuous time Markov chains on discrete state spaces. We refer to [1] and [2]
for the short "history" of the subject. In contrast with these references,
symmetry is not assumed, and more attention is given to the infinite case. All
results are presented in terms of the semigroup generator. In comparison with
[1], some delicate proofs are given in more details or with a better method. We
focus mostly on properties of the (multi)occupation field but also included
some results about loop clusters (see [3] in the symmetric context) and
spanning trees.
