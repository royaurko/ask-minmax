We study the basic preferential attachment process, which generates a
sequence of random trees, each obtained from the previous one by introducing a
new vertex and joining it to one existing vertex, chosen with probability
proportional to its degree. We investigate the number $D_t(\ell)$ of vertices
of each degree $\ell$ at each time $t$, focussing particularly on the case
where $\ell$ is a growing function of $t$. We show that $D_t(\ell)$ is
concentrated around its mean, which is approximately $4t/\ell^3$, for all $\ell
\le (t/\log t)^{-1/3}$; this is best possible up to a logarithmic factor.
