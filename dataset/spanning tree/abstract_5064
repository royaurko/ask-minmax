Measurements of resistance vs. temperature have been carried out on a
sequence of quench-condensed ultrathin films of amorphous bismuth (a-Bi). The
resistance below about 0.1K was found to be temperature independent in a range
of films with thicknesses spanning the superconductor-to-insulator transition
that would be inferred by analyzing data obtained above 0.14K. Film
magnetoresistance was temperature dependent in the same temperature range over
which the resistance was temperature independent. This implies that the low
temperature metallic regime is intrinsic, and not a consequence of failure to
cool the electrons.
