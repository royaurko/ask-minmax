Cryptographic access control has been studied for over 30 years and is now a
mature research topic. When symmetric cryptographic primitives are used, each
protected resource is encrypted and only contributorized users should have access to
the encryption key. By treating the keys themselves as protected resources, it
is possible to develop schemes in which contributorized keys are derived from the
keys explicitly assigned to the user's possession and publicly available
information. It has been generally assumed that each user would be assigned a
single key from which all other contributorized keys would be derived. Recent work
has challenged this assumption by developing schemes that do not require public
information, the trade-off being that a user may require more than one key.
However, these new schemes, which require a chain partition of the partially
ordered set on which the access control policy is based, have some
disadvantages. In this paper we define the notion of a tree-based cryptographic
enforcement scheme, which, like chain-based schemes, requires no public
information. We establish that the strong security properties of chain-based
schemes are preserved by tree-based schemes, and provide an efficient
construction for deriving a tree-based enforcement scheme from a given policy
that minimizes the number of keys required.
