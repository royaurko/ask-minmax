It is shown that for every positive integer $n$ there exists a subnormal
weighted shift on a directed tree (with or without root) whose $n$th power is
densely defined while its $(n+1)$th power is not. As a consequence, for every
positive integer $n$ there exists a non-symmetric subnormal composition
operator $C$ in an $L^2$ space over a $\sigma$-finite measure space such that
$C^n$ is densely defined and $C^{n+1}$ is not.
