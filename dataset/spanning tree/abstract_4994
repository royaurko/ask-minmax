Here we describe results of our attempt to determine what types of galaxies
are responsible for the Lyman-alpha forest absorption systems, based on our
ongoing imaging and spectroscopic survey of faint galaxies in fields of HST
spectroscopic target QSOs. Our primary conclusions are that the bulk of the
Lyman-alpha forest arises in more or less normal galaxies (that span the normal
range of luminosity and morphology) and that any ``unseen'' low surface
brightness galaxies are unlikely to contribute significantly to the luminosity
density of the universe.
