For the example of the logarithmic triplet theory at c=-2 the chiral vacuum
torus amplitudes are analysed. It is found that the space of these torus
amplitudes is spanned by the characters of the irreducible representations, as
well as a function that can be associated to the logarithmic extension of the
vacuum representation. A few implications and generalisations of this result
are discussed.
