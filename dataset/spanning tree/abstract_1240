We give a new bound on the sum of the linear Fourier coefficients of a
Boolean function in terms of its parity decision tree complexity. This result
generalizes an inequality of O'Donnell and Servedio for regular decision trees.
We use this bound to obtain the first non-trivial lower bound on the parity
decision tree complexity of the recursive majority function.
