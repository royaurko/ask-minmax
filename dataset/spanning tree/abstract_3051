We consider the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators, specifically the case
of tree networks, for which we prove a simple closed-form expression for the
critical coupling. For several classes of tree, and for both uniform and
Gaussian vertex frequency distributions, we provide tight closed form bounds
and empirical expressions for the expected value of the critical coupling. We
also provide several bounds on the expected value of the critical coupling for
all trees. Finally, we show that for a given set of vertex frequencies, there
is a rearrangement of oscillator frequencies for which the critical coupling is
bounded by the spread of frequencies.
