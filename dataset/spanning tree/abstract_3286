Total reaction cross sections are predicted for proton scattering from
various nuclei. A simple functional form has been used that reproduces the
total reaction cross sections for the scattering of protons from (15) nuclei
spanning the mass range from ${}^9$Be to ${}^{238}$U and for proton energies 10
to 300 MeV.
