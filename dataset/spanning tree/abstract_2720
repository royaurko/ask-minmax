We present a functional programming language for specifying constraints over
tree-shaped data. The language allows for Haskell-like algebraic data types and
pattern matching. Our constraint compiler CO4 translates these programs into
satisfiability problems in propositional logic. We present an application from
the area of automated analysis of (non-)termination of rewrite systems.
