A variety of algorithms have been proposed for reconstructing trees that show
the evolutionary relationships between species by comparing differences in
genetic data across present-day taxa. If the leaf-to-leaf distances in a tree
can be accurately estimated, then it is possible to reconstruct this tree from
these estimated distances, using polynomial-time methods such as the popular
`Neighbor-Joining' algorithm. There is a precise combinatorial condition under
which distance-based methods are guaranteed to return a correct tree (in full
or in part) based on the requirement that the input distances all lie within
some `safety radius' of the true distances. Here, we explore a stochastic
analogue of this condition, and mathematically establish upper and lower bounds
on this `stochastic safety radius' for distance-based tree reconstruction
methods. Using simulations, we show how this notion provides a new way to
compare the performance of distance-based tree reconstruction methods. This may
help explain why Neighbor-Joining performs so well, as its stochastic safety
radius appears close to optimal (while its more classical safety radius is the
same as many other less accurate methods).
