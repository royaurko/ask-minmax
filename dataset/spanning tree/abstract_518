We introduce the concept of a relative Tutte polynomial of colored graphs. We
show that this relative Tutte polynomial can be computed in a way similar to
the classical spanning tree expansion used by Tutte in his original paper on
this subject. We then apply the relative Tutte polynomial to virtual knot
theory. More specifically, we show that the Kauffman bracket polynomial (hence
the Jones polynomial) of a virtual knot can be computed from the relative Tutte
polynomial of its face (Tait) graph with some suitable variable substitutions.
Our method offers an alternative to the ribbon graph approach, using the face
graph obtained from the virtual link diagram directly.
