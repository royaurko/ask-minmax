A hypergraph $G=(V,E)$ is $(k,\ell)$-sparse if no subset $V'\subset V$ spans
more than $k|V'|-\ell$ hyperedges. We characterize $(k,\ell)$-sparse
hypergraphs in terms of graph theoretic, matroidal and algorithmic properties.
We extend several well-known theorems of Haas, Lov{\'{a}}sz, Nash-Williams,
Tutte, and White and Whiteley, linking arboricity of graphs to certain counts
on the number of edges. We also address the problem of finding
lower-dimensional representations of sparse hypergraphs, and identify a
critical behaviour in terms of the sparsity parameters $k$ and $\ell$. Our
constructions extend the pebble games of Lee and Streinu from graphs to
hypergraphs.
