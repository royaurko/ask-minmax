We report recent results from a high resolution numerical study of fluid
particles transported by a fully developed turbulent flow. Single particle
trajectories were followed for a time range spanning more than three decades,
from less than a tenth of the Kolmogorov time-scale up to one large-eddy
turnover time. We present some results concerning acceleration statistics and
the statistics of trapping by vortex filaments.
