The normal operation of power system relies on accurate state estimation that
faithfully reflects the physical aspects of the electrical power grids.
However, recent research shows that carefully synthesized false-data injection
attacks can bypass the security system and introduce arbitrary errors to state
estimates. In this paper, we use graphical methods to study defending
mechanisms against false-data injection attacks on power system state
estimation. By securing carefully selected meter measurements, no false data
injection attack can be launched to compromise any set of state variables. We
characterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables
with minimum number of measurements, as a variant Steiner tree problem in a
graph. Based on the graphical characterization, we propose both exact and
reduced-complexity approximation algorithms. In particular, we show that the
proposed tree-pruning based approximation algorithm significantly reduces
computational complexity, while yielding negligible performance degradation
compared with the optimal algorithms. The advantageous performance of the
proposed defending mechanisms is verified in IEEE standard power system
testcases.
