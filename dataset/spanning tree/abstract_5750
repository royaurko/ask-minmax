Zeilberger's enumeration schemes can be used to completely automate the
enumeration of many permutation classes. We extend his enumeration schemes so
that they apply to many more permutation classes and describe the Maple package
WILFPLUS, which implements this process. We also compare enumeration schemes to
three other systematic enumeration techniques: generating trees, substitution
decompositions, and the insertion encoding.
