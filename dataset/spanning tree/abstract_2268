The Valence-Bond-Solid (VBS) states are in general ground states for certain
gapped models. We consider the entanglement of VBS states on a two-dimensional
Cayley tree. We show that the entropy of the reduced density operator does not
depend on the whole size of the Cayley tree. We also show that asymptotically,
the entropy is liearly proportional to the number of singlet states cut by the
reduced density operator of the VBS state.
