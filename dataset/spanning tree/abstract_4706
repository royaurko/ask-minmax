We develop a method for transmission stabilization and robust dynamic
switching for colliding optical soliton sequences in broadband waveguide
systems with nonlinear gain and loss. The method is based on employing hybrid
waveguides, consisting of spans with linear gain and cubic loss, and spans with
linear loss, cubic gain, and quintic loss. We show that amplitude dynamics is
described by a hybrid Lotka-Volterra (LV) model, and use the model to determine
the physical parameter values required for enhanced transmission stabilization
and switching. Numerical simulations with the coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equations confirm the predictions of the LV model, and show stable transmission
over distances larger by an order of magnitude compared with uniform waveguides
with linear gain and cubic loss. Moreover, multiple on-off and off-on dynamic
switching events are demonstrated over a wide range of soliton amplitudes,
showing the superiority of hybrid waveguides compared with static switching in
uniform waveguides, considered in earlier studies.
