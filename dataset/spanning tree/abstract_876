The subdivision graph $\mathcal{S}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph obtained
by inserting a new vertex into every edge of $G$. Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be two
vertex disjoint graphs. The subdivision-vertex join of $G_1$ and $G_2$, denoted
by $G_1\dot{\vee}G_2$, is the graph obtained from $\mathcal{S}(G_1)$ and $G_2$
by joining every vertex of $V(G_1)$ with every vertex of $V(G_2)$. The
subdivision-edge join of $G_1$ and $G_2$, denoted by $G_1\underline{\vee}G_2$,
is the graph obtained from $\mathcal{S}(G_1)$ and $G_2$ by joining every vertex
of $I(G_1)$ with every vertex of $V(G_2)$, where $I(G_1)$ is the set of
inserted vertices of $\mathcal{S}(G_1)$. In this paper we determine the
adjacency spectra, the Laplacian spectra and the signless Laplacian spectra of
$G_1\dot{\vee}G_2$ (respectively, $G_1\underline{\vee}G_2$) for a regular graph
$G_1$ and an arbitrary graph $G_2$, in terms of the corresponding spectra of
$G_1$ and $G_2$. As applications, these results enable us to construct
infinitely many pairs of cospectral graphs. We also give the number of the
spanning trees and the Kirchhoff index of $G_1\dot{\vee}G_2$ (respectively,
$G_1\underline{\vee}G_2$) for a regular graph $G_1$ and an arbitrary graph
$G_2$.
