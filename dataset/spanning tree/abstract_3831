We propose a new conjecture on some exponential sums. These particular sums
have not apparently been considered in the literature. Subject to the
conjecture we obtain the first effective construction of asymptotically good
tree codes. The available numerical evidence is consistent with the conjecture
and is sufficient to certify codes for significant-length communications.
