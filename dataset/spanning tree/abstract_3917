We investigate a family of groups acting on a regular tree, and whose local
action is prescribed almost everywhere. We study lattices in these groups, and
give examples of compactly generated simple groups of finite asymptotic
dimension (actually one) not containing lattices. We also obtain examples of
simple groups with simple lattices, and we prove the existence of (infinitely
many) finitely generated simple groups of asymptotic dimension one.
  We also prove various properties of these groups, among other the existence
of a proper action on a CAT(0) cube complex.
