We study the pion-baryon scattering process $\pi+B \to (n-1)\pi+B$ in a QCD
theory with a large number (N_c) of colors. It is known that this scattering
amplitudes decreases with N_c like N_c^{1-n/2}, and that its individual tree
diagrams grow like N_c^{n/2}. The only way these two can be consistent is for
n-1 powers of N_c to be cancelled when the Feynman diagrams are summed. We
prove this to be true in tree order for any n.
