Recently, Han discovered two formulas involving binary trees which have the
interestig property that hooklengths appear as exponents. The purpose of this
note is to give a probabilistic proof of one of Han's formulas. Yang has
generalized Han's results to ordered trees. We show how the probabilistic
approach can also be used in Yang's setting, as well as for a generalization of
Han's formula in terms of certain infinite trees.
