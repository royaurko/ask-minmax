Charmless $B$ decays are dominated by contributions from the short distance
amplitudes from tree level and penguin loop-level amplitudes. The Tree
contribution presents a weak phase $\gamma$. The relationship between these two
amplitudes can generated a CP asymmetry depending from the relative amount
among them in a particular decay. In multi-body charmless $B$ decays, these
relative contribution can change along the phase space, given a non isotropic
distribution of CP asymmetries in the Dalitz plot. Two recent LHCb analyses
involving charmless multi-body B decays are discussed: the obsevation of CP
asymmetries in the phase space of the three-body decays $B^\pm \to \pi^\pm
\pi^+ \pi^-$ and $B^\pm \to \pi^\pm K^+ K^-$; and the angular analysis of the
$B^0 \to \phi K^*(892)^0$ decay.
