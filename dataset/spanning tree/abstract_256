We consider the NP-hard problem of finding a spanning tree with a maximum
number of internal vertices. This problem is a generalization of the famous
  Hamiltonian Path problem. Our dynamic-programming algorithms for general and
degree-bounded graphs have running times of the form O*(c^n) (c <= 3). The main
result, however, is a branching algorithm for graphs with maximum degree three.
It only needs polynomial space and has a running time of O*(1.8669^n) when
analyzed with respect to the number of vertices. We also show that its running
time is 2.1364^k n^O(1) when the goal is to find a spanning tree with at least
k internal vertices. Both running time bounds are obtained via a Measure &
Conquer analysis, the latter one being a novel use of this kind of analyses for
parameterized algorithms.
