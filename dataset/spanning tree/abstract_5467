We develop a general framework for reflexivity in dual Banach spaces,
motivated by the question of when the weak* closed linear span of two reflexive
masa-bimodules is automatically reflexive. We establish an affirmative answer
to this question in a number of cases by examining two new classes of
masa-bimodules, defined in terms of ranges of masa-bimodule projections. We
give a number of corollaries of our results concerning operator and spectral
synthesis, and show that the classes of masa-bimodules we study are operator
synthetic if and only if they are strong operator Ditkin.
