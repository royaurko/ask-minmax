In our earlier research an area of consistent and systematic application of
software metrics was explored. Strong dependency of applicability of software
metrics on input programming language was recognized as one of the main
weaknesses in this field. Introducing enriched Concrete Syntax Tree (eCST) for
internal and intermediate representation of the source code resulted with step
forward over this weakness. In this paper we explain innovation made by
introducing eCST and provide idea for broader applicability of eCST in some
other fields of software engineering.
