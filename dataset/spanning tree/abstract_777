This paper constructs a framework to describe and study the coordinated
output regulation problem for multiple heterogeneous linear systems. Each agent
is modeled as a general linear multiple-input multiple-output system with an
autonomous exosystem which represents the individual offset from the group
reference for the agent. The multi-agent system as a whole has a group
exogenous state which represents the tracking reference for the whole group.
Under the constraints that the group exogenous output is only locally available
to each agent and that the agents have only access to their neighbors'
information, we propose observer-based feedback controllers to solve the
coordinated output regulation problem using output feedback information. A
high-gain approach is used and the information interactions are allowed to be
switched over a finite set of fixed networks containing both graphs that have a
directed spanning tree and graphs that do not. The fundamental relationship
between the information interactions, the dwell time, the non-identical
dynamics of different agents, and the high-gain parameters is given.
Simulations are shown to validate the theoretical results.
