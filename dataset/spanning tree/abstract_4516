We study the correlation of top asymmetries that are sensitive to the
different origin of (a new contribution to) the total asymmetry: loop- or
tree-level origins. We find that both the size and sign of the correlation
between total and $t\bar{t}j$ inclusive asymmetries are inherently different
depending on the origin. We demonstrate the correlation by using the
color-singlet $Z^\prime$ and the pure axigluon taken as representative models
of loop- and tree-induced total asymmetries. We calculate the next-to-leading
order QCD corrections to the $Z^\prime$ and perform Monte-Carlo event
generation. The correlation is understood in the QCD eikonal approximation
using its color structure.
