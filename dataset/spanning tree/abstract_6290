We study gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking in four-dimensional
effective theories derived from six-dimensional brane-world supergravity. Using
the Noether method we construct a locally supersymmetric action for a
bulk-brane system consisting of the minimal six-dimensional supergravity
coupled to vector and chiral multiplets located at four-dimensional branes.
Couplings of the bulk moduli to the brane are uniquely fixed, in particular,
they are flavour universal. We compactify this system on T_2/Z_2 and derive the
four-dimensional effective supergravity. The tree-level effective Kahler
potential is not of the sequestered form, therefore gravity mediation may occur
at tree-level. We identify one scenario of moduli stabilization in which the
soft scalar masses squared are postive.
