In the absence of a tree-level scalar-field mass, renormalization-group
methods permit the explicit summation of leading-logarithm contributions to all
orders of the perturbative series within the effective potential for
$SU(2)\times U(1)$ electroweak symmetry. This improvement of the effective
potential function is seen to reduce residual dependence on the renormalization
mass scale. The all-orders summation of leading logarithm terms involving the
dominant three couplings contributing to radiative corrections is suggestive of
a potential characterized by a plausible Higgs boson mass of 216 GeV. However,
the tree potential's local minimum at $\phi =0$ is restored if QCD is
sufficiently strong.
