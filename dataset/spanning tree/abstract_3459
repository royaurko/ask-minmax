$SO(10)$ grand unified models have an intermediate symmetry group in between
$SO(10)$ and $SU(3)_{C} \otimes SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$. Hence they lead to
a prediction for proton lifetime in agreement with the experimental lower
limit. This paper reviews the recent work on the tree-level potential and the
one-loop effective potential for such models, with application to inflationary
cosmology. The open problems are the use of the most general form of tree-level
potential for $SO(10)$ models in the reheating stage of the early universe, and
the analysis of non-local effects in the semiclassical field equations for such
models in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker backgrounds.
