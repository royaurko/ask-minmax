A new group-theory method to relate a spectrum of carbon nanotubes with that
of a graphene monolayer is elaborated. The spectrum reconstruction is performed
using a virtual intermediate planar periodic structure. Selected irreducible
representations of its space symmetry group and all those of the nanotube one
are isomorphic and therefore span the correlated excitations. The method is
applied to study the origin of the zone-center phonon modes of chiral and
achiral carbon nanotubes. The structure of the G-band for particular types of
nanotubes is determined. The results obtained could be useful for experimental
indexing of the carbon nanotubes by means of Raman spectroscopy.
