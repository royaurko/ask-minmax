We compute the nonleptonic weak decay width of a heavy-light meson in 1+1
spacetime dimensions with a large number of QCD colors (the 't Hooft model) as
a function of the heavy quark mass. In this limit, QCD is exactly soluble, and
decay modes are dominated by two-particle final states. We compare the results
to the tree-level partonic decay width of the heavy quark in order to test
quark-hadron duality in this universe. We find that this duality is
surprisingly well satisfied in the heavy quark limit, in that the difference
between the sum of exclusive partial widths and the tree-level partonic width
approaches a constant as M --> infinity, and the deviation is well-fit by a
small 1/M correction. We comment on the meaning of this conclusion and its
implications for the use of quark-hadron duality in hadronic physics.
