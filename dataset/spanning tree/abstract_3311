A pseudo [2,b]-factor of a graph G is a spanning subgraph in which each
component C on at least three vertices is a [2,b]-graph. The main contibution
of this paper, is to give an upper bound to the number of components that are
edges or vertices in a pseudo [2,b]-factor of a graph G. This bound is sharp.
