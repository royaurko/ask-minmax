We propose and test new statistical tools to study the distribution of cosmic
rays based on the use of the Minimal Spanning Tree. The method described is
particularly sensitive to filamentary structures, as those expected to arise
from strong sources of charged cosmic rays which get deflected by intervening
magnetic fields. We also test the method with data available from the AGASA and
SUGAR surface detector arrays.
