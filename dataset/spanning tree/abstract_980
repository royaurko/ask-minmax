This document presents the full implementation details of BT-trees, a highly
efficient ordered map, and an evaluation which compares BT-trees with unordered
maps. BT- trees are often much faster than other ordered maps, and have
comparable performance to unordered map implementations. However, in benchmarks
which favor unordered maps, BT-trees are not faster than the fastest unordered
map implementations we know of.
