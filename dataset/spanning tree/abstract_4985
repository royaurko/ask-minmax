We calculate the spectra expected from unsteady relativistic wind models of
gamma-ray bursts, suitable for events of arbitrary duration. The spectral
energy distribution of the burst is calculated over photon energies spanning
from eV to TeV, for a range of event durations and variability timescales. The
relative strength of the emission at different wavelengths can provide valuable
information on the particle acceleration, radiation mechanisms and the possible
types of models.
