We present linear-time algorithms to construct tree-like Voronoi diagrams
with disconnected regions, after the sequence of their faces along an enclosing
boundary (or at infinity) is known. We focus on Voronoi diagrams of line
segments including the farthest-segment Voronoi diagram, the order-(k+1)
subdivision within an order-k Voronoi region, and deleting a site from a
nearest-neighbor segment Voronoi diagram. Although tree-structured, these
diagrams illustrate properties surprisingly different from their counterparts
for points. The sequence of their faces along the relevant boundary forms a
Davenport-Schinzel sequence of order >=2. Once this sequence is known, we show
how to compute the corresponding Voronoi diagram in linear time, expected or
deterministic, augmenting the existing frameworks for points in convex position
with the ability to handle non-point sites and multiple Voronoi faces. Our
techniques contribute towards the question of linear-time construction
algorithms for Voronoi diagrams whose graph structure is a tree.
