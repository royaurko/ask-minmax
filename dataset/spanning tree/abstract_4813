Tree decompositions of graphs are of fundamental importance in structural and
algorithmic graph theory. Planar decompositions generalise tree decompositions
by allowing an arbitrary planar graph to index the decomposition. We prove that
every graph that excludes a fixed graph as a minor has a planar decomposition
with bounded width and a linear number of bags.
  The crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of crossings in a
drawing of the graph in the plane. We prove that planar decompositions are
intimately related to the crossing number. In particular, a graph with bounded
degree has linear crossing number if and only if it has a planar decomposition
with bounded width and a linear number of bags. It follows from the above
result about planar decompositions that every graph with bounded degree and an
excluded minor has linear crossing number.
  Analogous results are proved for the convex and rectilinear crossing numbers.
In particular, every graph with bounded degree and bounded tree-width has
linear convex crossing number, and every $K_{3,3}$-minor-free graph with
bounded degree has linear rectilinear crossing number.
