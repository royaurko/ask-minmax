In recent work, Kobayashi observed that the acceptance by an alternating tree
automaton A of an infinite tree T generated by a higher-order recursion scheme
G may be formulated as the typability of the recursion scheme G in an
appropriate intersection type system associated to the automaton A. The purpose
of this article is to establish a clean connection between this line of work
and Bucciarelli and Ehrhard's indexed linear logic. This is achieved in two
steps. First, we recast Kobayashi's result in an equivalent infinitary
intersection type system where intersection is not idempotent anymore. Then, we
show that the resulting type system is a fragment of an infinitary version of
Bucciarelli and Ehrhard's indexed linear logic. While this work is very
preliminary and does not integrate key ingredients of higher-order
model-checking like priorities, it reveals an interesting and promising
connection between higher-order model-checking and linear logic.
