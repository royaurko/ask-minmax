The interlace polynomials introduced by Arratia, Bollobas and Sorkin extend
to invariants of graphs with vertex weights, and these weighted interlace
polynomials have several novel properties. One novel property is a version of
the fundamental three-term formula
q(G)=q(G-a)+q(G^{ab}-b)+((x-1)^{2}-1)q(G^{ab}-a-b) that lacks the last term. It
follows that interlace polynomial computations can be represented by binary
trees rather than mixed binary-ternary trees. Binary computation trees provide
a description of $q(G)$ that is analogous to the activities description of the
Tutte polynomial. If $G$ is a tree or forest then these "algorithmic
activities" are associated with a certain kind of independent set in $G$. Three
other novel properties are weighted pendant-twin reductions, which involve
removing certain kinds of vertices from a graph and adjusting the weights of
the remaining vertices in such a way that the interlace polynomials are
unchanged. These reductions allow for smaller computation trees as they
eliminate some branches. If a graph can be completely analyzed using
pendant-twin reductions then its interlace polynomial can be calculated in
polynomial time. An intuitively pleasing property is that graphs which can be
constructed through graph substitutions have vertex-weighted interlace
polynomials which can be obtained through algebraic substitutions.
