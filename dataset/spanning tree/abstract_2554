A brief summary is given of the Group-Variation Equations and the island
diagram confinement mechanism, with an explanation of the prediction that the
cylinder-topology minimal-area spanning surface term in the correlation
function of two Wilson loops at large $N_c$, when it exists, must have a
pre-exponential factor, which for large area $A$ of the minimal-area
cylinder-topology spanning surface, decreases with increasing $A$ at least as
fast as $1/\ln(\sigma A)$, where $\sigma$ is the area law parameter. This
prediction is expected to be testable in lattice calculations.
