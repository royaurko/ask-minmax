Summary: GeneSupport implements a genome-scale algorithm: Maximum
Gene-Support Tree to estimate species tree from gene trees based on multilocus
sequences. It provides a new option for multiple genes to infer species tree.
It is incorporated into popular phylogentic program: PHYLIP package with the
same usage and user interface. It is suitable for phylogenetic methods such as
maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, Baysian and neighbour-joining, which is
used to reconstruct single gene trees firstly with a variety of phylogenetic
inference programs.
