In this paper, containment control of multi-agent systems with measurement
noises is studied under directed networks. When the leaders are stationary, a
stochastic approximation type protocol is employed to solve the containment
control of multi-agent systems. By using stochastic analysis tools and
algebraic graph theory, some necessary and sufficient criteria are established
to ensure the followers converge to the convex hull spanned by the leaders in
the sense of mean square and probability 1. When the leasers are dynamic, a
stochastic approximation type protocol with distributed estimators is developed
and necessary and sufficient conditions are also obtained for solving the
containment control problem. Simulations are provided to illustrate the
effectiveness of the theoretical results.
