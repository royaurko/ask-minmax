We study multicomponent plane curves with possible singularities of
selftangency type. To each such curve we assign a so-called L-space, which is a
Lagrangian subspace in an even-dimensional vector space with the standard
symplectic form. This invariant generalizes the notion of the intersection
matrix for the framed chord diagram of a one-component plane curve. Moreover,
the actions of Morse perestroikas and Vassiliev moves are reinterpreted nicely
in the language of L-spaces, becoming changes of bases in this vector space.
Finally, we define a bialgebra structure on the span of L-spaces.
