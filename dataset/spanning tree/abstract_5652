A simple approach is presented to study the asymptotic behavior of some
algorithms with an underlying tree structure. It is shown that some asymptotic
oscillating behaviors can be precisely analyzed without resorting to complex
analysis techniques as it is usually done in this context. A new explicit
representation of periodic functions involved is obtained at the same time.
