We prove an apparently novel concentration of measure result for Markov tree
processes. The bound we derive reduces to the known bounds for Markov processes
when the tree is a chain, thus strictly generalizing the known Markov process
concentration results. We employ several techniques of potential independent
interest, especially for obtaining similar results for more general directed
acyclic graphical models.
