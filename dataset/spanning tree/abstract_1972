Crump-Mode-Jagers (CMJ) trees generalize Galton-Watson trees by allowing
individuals to live for an arbitrary duration and give birth at arbitrary times
during their life-time. In this paper, we are interested in the height and
contour processes encoding a general CMJ tree.
  We show that the one-dimensional distribution of the height process can be
expressed in terms of a random transformation of the ladder height process
associated with the underlying Lukasiewicz path. As an application of this
result, when edges of the tree are "short" we show that (1) the height process
is obtained by stretching by a constant factor the height process of the
associated genealogical Galton-Watson tree, and that (2) the contour process is
obtained from the height process by a constant time change, thus generalizing a
classical result in the Galton-Watson case.
