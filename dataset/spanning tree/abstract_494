We experimentally study the red-green-blue model, which is a sytem of loops
obtained by superimposing three dimer coverings on offset hexagonal lattices.
We find that when the boundary conditions are ``flat'', the red-green-blue
loops are closely related to SLE_4 and double-dimer loops, which are the loops
formed by superimposing two dimer coverings of the cartesian lattice. But we
also find that the red-green-blue loops are more tightly nested than the
double-dimer loops. We also investigate the 2D minimum spanning tree, and find
that it is not conformally invariant.
