For a graph consider the pairs of disjoint matchings which union contains as
many edges as possible, and define a parameter $\alpha$ which eqauls the
cardinality of the largest matching in those pairs. Also, define $\betta$ to be
the cardinality of a maximum matching of the graph.
  We give a constructive characterization of trees which satisfy the
$\alpha$=$\betta$ equality. The proof of our main theorem is based on a new
decomposition algorithm obtained for trees.
