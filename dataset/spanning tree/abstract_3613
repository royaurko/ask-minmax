Natural image statistics exhibit hierarchical dependencies across multiple
scales. Representing such prior knowledge in non-factorial latent tree models
can boost performance of image denoising, inpainting, deconvolution or
reconstruction substantially, beyond standard factorial "sparse" methodology.
We derive a large scale approximate Bayesian inference algorithm for linear
models with non-factorial (latent tree-structured) scale mixture priors.
Experimental results on a range of denoising and inpainting problems
demonstrate substantially improved performance compared to MAP estimation or to
inference with factorial priors.
