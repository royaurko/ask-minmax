We consider a family of random trees satisfying a Markov branching property.
Roughly, this property says that the subtrees above some given height are
independent with a law that depends only on their total size, the latter being
either the number of leaves or vertices. Such families are parameterized by
sequences of distributions on partitions of the integers that determine how the
size of a tree is distributed in its different subtrees. Under some natural
assumption on these distributions, stipulating that "macroscopic" splitting
events are rare, we show that Markov branching trees admit the so-called
self-similar fragmentation trees as scaling limits in the
Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov topology. The main application of these results is
that the scaling limit of random uniform unordered trees is the Brownian
continuum random tree. This extends a result by Marckert-Miermont and fully
proves a conjecture by Aldous. We also recover, and occasionally extend,
results on scaling limits of consistent Markov branching models and known
convergence results of Galton-Watson trees toward the Brownian and stable
continuum random trees.
