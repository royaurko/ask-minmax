Given a digraph $D=(V,A)$ and a positive integer $k$, an arc set $F\subseteq
A$ is called a \textbf{$k$-arborescence} if it is the disjoint union of $k$
spanning arborescences. The problem of finding a minimum cost $k$-arborescence
is known to be polynomial-time solvable using matroid intersection. In this
paper we study the following problem: find a minimum cardinality subset of arcs
that contains at least one arc from every minimum cost $k$-arborescence. For
$k=1$, the problem was solved in [A. Bern\'ath, G. Pap , Blocking optimal
arborescences, IPCO 2013]. In this paper we give an algorithm for general $k$
that has polynomial running time if $k$ is fixed.
