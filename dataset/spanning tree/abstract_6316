Given a matroid M on the ground set E, the Bergman fan B(M), or space of
M-ultrametrics, is a polyhedral complex in R^E which arises in several
different areas, such as tropical algebraic geometry, dynamical systems, and
phylogenetics. Motivated by the phylogenetic situation, we study the following
problem: Given a point w in R^E, we wish to find an M-ultrametric which is
closest to it in the l_infty metric.
  The solution to this problem follows easily from the existence of the
subdominant M-ultrametric: a componentwise maximum M-ultrametric which is
componentwise smaller than w. A procedure for computing it is given, which
brings together the points of view of matroid theory and tropical geometry.
  When the matroid in question is the graphical matroid of the complete graph
K_n, the Bergman fan B(K_n) parameterizes the equidistant phylogenetic trees
with n leaves. In this case, our results provide a conceptual explanation for
Chepoi and Fichet's method for computing the tree that most closely matches
measured data.
