Recent lab experiments by Traulsen et al. for the spatial prisoner's dilemma
suggest that exploratory behavior of human subjects prevents cooperation
through neighborhood interactions over experimentally accessible time spans.
This indicates that new theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to
explore the mechanisms underlying a number of famous puzzles in the social
sciences.
