We analyze the two-dimensional Abelian sandpile model, and demonstrate that
the four height variables have different field identifications in the bulk, and
along closed boundaries, but become identical, up to rescaling, along open
boundaries. We consider two-point boundary correlations in detail, and discuss
a number of complications that arise in the mapping from sandpile correlations
to spanning tree correlations; the structure of our results suggests a
conjecture that could greatly simplify future calculations. We find a number of
three-point functions along closed boundaries, and propose closed boundary
field identifications for the height variables. We analyze the effects of
dissipative defect sites, at which the number of grains is not conserved, and
show that dissipative defects along closed boundaries, and in the bulk, have no
effect on any weakly allowed cluster variables, or on their correlations. Along
open boundaries, we find a particularly simple field structure; we calculate
all $n$-point correlations, for any combinations of height variables and
dissipative defect sites, and find that all heights and defects are represented
by the same field operator.
