We obtain explicit susceptibilities for the countable infinity of phase
transition temperatures of M\"{u}ller-Hartmann-Zitartz on a Cayley tree. The
susceptibilities are a product of the zeroth spin with the sum of an
appropriate set of averages of spins on the outermost layer of the tree. A
clear physical understanding for these strange phase transitions emerges
naturally. In the thermodynamic limit, the susceptibilities tend to zero above
the transition and to infinity below it.
