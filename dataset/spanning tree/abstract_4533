Learning structured outputs with general structures is computationally
challenging, except for tree-structured models. Thus we propose an efficient
boosting-based algorithm AdaBoost.MRF for this task. The idea is based on the
realization that a graph is a superimposition of trees. Different from most
existing work, our algorithm can handle partial labelling, and thus is
particularly attractive in practice where reliable labels are often sparsely
observed. In addition, our method works exclusively on trees and thus is
guaranteed to converge. We apply the AdaBoost.MRF algorithm to an indoor video
surveillance scenario, where activities are modelled at multiple levels.
