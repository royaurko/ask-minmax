We give a new proof of the theorem of Birman-Powell that the Torelli subgroup
of the mapping class group of a closed orientable surface of genus at least 3
is generated by simple homeomorphisms known as bounding pair maps. The key
ingredient is a proof that the subcomplex of the curve complex of the surface
spanned by curves within a fixed homology class is connected.
