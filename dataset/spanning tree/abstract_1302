Consider a family of random ordered graph trees $(T_n)_{n\geq 1}$, where
$T_n$ has $n$ vertices. It has previously been established that if the
associated search-depth processes converge to the normalised Brownian excursion
when rescaled appropriately as $n\rightarrow\infty$, then the simple random
walks on the graph trees have the Brownian motion on the Brownian continuum
random tree as their scaling limit. Here, this result is extended to
demonstrate the existence of a diffusion scaling limit whenever the volume
measure on the limiting real tree is nonatomic, supported on the leaves of the
limiting tree, and satisfies a polynomial lower bound for the volume of balls.
Furthermore, as an application of this generalisation, it is established that
the simple random walks on a family of Galton-Watson trees with a critical
infinite variance offspring distribution, conditioned on the total number of
offspring, can be rescaled to converge to the Brownian motion on a related
$\alpha$-stable tree.
