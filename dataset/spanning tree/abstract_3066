We introduce the generic structure of a growth model for branched discharge
trees that consistently combines a finite channel conductivity with the
physical law of charge conservation. It is applicable, e.g., to streamer
coronas near tip or wire electrodes and ahead of lightning leaders, to leaders
themselves and to the complex breakdown structures of sprite discharges high
above thunderclouds. Then we implement and solve the simplest model for
positive streamers in ambient air with self-consistent charge transport. We
demonstrate that charge conservation contradicts the common assumption of
dielectric breakdown models that the electric fields inside all streamers are
equal to the so-called stability field and we even find cases of local field
inversion. We also discuss the charge distribution inside discharge trees,
which provides a natural explanation for the observed reconnections of
streamers in laboratory experiments and in sprites. Our simulations show the
structure of an overall "streamer of streamers" that we name collective
streamer front, and predict effective streamer branching angles, the charge
structure within streamer trees, and streamer reconnection.
