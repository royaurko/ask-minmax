We prove that the infinite components of the Free Uniform Spanning Forest of
a Cayley graph are indistinguishable by any invariant property, given that the
forest is different from its wired counterpart. Similar result is obtained for
the Free Minimal Spanning Forest. We also show that with the above assumptions
there can only be 0, 1 or infinitely many components. These answer questions by
Benjamini, Lyons, Peres and Schramm. Our methods apply to a more general class
of percolations, those satisfying "weak insertion tolerance", and work beyond
Cayley graphs, in the more general setting of unimodular random graphs.
