We consider the problem of formalizing the familiar notion of widening in
abstract interpretation in higher-order logic. It turns out that many axioms of
widening (e.g. widening sequences are ascending) are not useful for proving
correctness. After keeping only useful axioms, we give an equivalent
characterization of widening as a lazily constructed well-founded tree. In type
systems supporting dependent products and sums, this tree can be made to
reflect the condition of correct termination of the widening sequence.
