In this paper we present a new tree-rewriting formalism called Link-Sharing
Tree Adjoining Grammar (LSTAG) which is a variant of synchronous TAGs. Using
LSTAG we define an approach towards coordination where linguistic dependency is
distinguished from the notion of constituency. Such an approach towards
coordination that explicitly distinguishes dependencies from constituency gives
a better formal understanding of its representation when compared to previous
approaches that use tree-rewriting systems which conflate the two issues.
