Different ways to describe a permutation, as a sequence of integers, or a
product of Coxeter generators, or a tree, give different choices to define a
simple permutation. We recollect few of them, define new types of simple
permutations, and analyze their interconnections and some asymptotic and
geometrical properties of these classes.
