Risk bounds for Classification and Regression Trees (CART, Breiman et. al.
1984) classifiers are obtained under a margin condition in the binary
supervised classification framework. These risk bounds are obtained
conditionally on the construction of the maximal deep binary tree and permit to
prove that the linear penalty used in the CART pruning algorithm is valid under
a margin condition. It is also shown that, conditionally on the construction of
the maximal tree, the final selection by test sample does not alter
dramatically the estimation accuracy of the Bayes classifier. In the two-class
classification framework, the risk bounds that are proved, obtained by using
penalized model selection, validate the CART algorithm which is used in many
data mining applications such as Biology, Medicine or Image Coding.
