Over the last 30 years, researchers have investigated connections between
dimension for posets and planarity for graphs. Here we extend this line of
research to the structural graph theory parameter tree-width by proving that
the dimension of a finite poset is bounded in terms of its height and the
tree-width of its cover graph.
