Given any regularly varying dislocation measure, we identify a natural
self-similar fragmentation tree as scaling limit of discrete fragmentation
trees with unit edge lengths. As an application, we obtain continuum random
tree limits of Aldous's beta-splitting models and Ford's alpha models for
phylogenetic trees. This confirms in a strong way that the whole trees grow at
the same speed as the mean height of a randomly chosen leaf.
