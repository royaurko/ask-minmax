Formulas for matrix determinants, algebraic adjunctions, characteristic
polynomial coefficients, components of eigenvectors are obtained in the form of
signless sums of matrix elements products taking by special graphs. Signless
formulas are very important for singular and stochastic problems. They are also
useful for spectral analysis of large very sparse matrices.
