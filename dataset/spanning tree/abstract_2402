We present a class of cooperative sequential adsorption models on a Cayley
tree with constant and variable attachment rates and their possible
applications for ionic self-assembly of thin films and drug encapsulation of
nanoparticles. Using the empty interval method, and generalizing results known
from reaction-diffusion processes on Cayley trees, we calculate a variety of
quantities such as time-dependent surface coverage and time-dependent
probabilities of certain particle configurations.
