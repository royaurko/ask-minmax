This review is dedicated to the amazing Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations,
connecting perturbative gravity and gauge theories at tree level. The main
focus is on n-point derivations and general properties both from a string
theory and pure field theory point of view. In particular the field theory part
is based on some very recent developments.
