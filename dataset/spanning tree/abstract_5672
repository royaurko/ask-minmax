We find that various results of current algebra at tree level and beyond can be
directly obtained from a master formula, without use of chiral perturbation
theory or effective Lagrangians. Application is made to $\pi \pi$ scattering,
where it is shown that the bulk of the $\rho$ contribution can be determined in
a model independent way.
