We propose a new family of message passing techniques for MAP estimation in
graphical models which we call {\em Sequential Reweighted Message Passing}
(SRMP). Special cases include well-known techniques such as {\em Min-Sum
Diffusion} (MSD) and a faster {\em Sequential Tree-Reweighted Message Passing}
(TRW-S). Importantly, our derivation is simpler than the original derivation of
TRW-S, and does not involve a decomposition into trees. This allows easy
generalizations. We present such a generalization for the case of higher-order
graphical models, and test it on several real-world problems with promising
results.
