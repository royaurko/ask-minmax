We analyze several florae (collections of plant species populating specific
areas) in different geographic and climatic regions. For every list of species
we produce a taxonomic classification tree and we consider its statistical
properties. We find that regardless of the geographical location, the climate
and the environment all species collections have universal statistical
properties that we show to be also robust in time. We then compare observed
data sets with simulated communities obtained by randomly sampling a large pool
of species from all over the world. We find differences in the behavior of the
statistical properties of the corresponding taxonomic trees. Our results
suggest that it is possible to distinguish quantitatively real species
assemblages from random collections and thus demonstrate the existence of
correlations between species.
