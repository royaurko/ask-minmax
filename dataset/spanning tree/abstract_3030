Self-stabilization is a versatile approach to fault-tolerance since it
permits a distributed system to recover from any transient fault that
arbitrarily corrupts the contents of all memories in the system. Byzantine
tolerance is an attractive feature of distributed systems that permits to cope
with arbitrary malicious behaviors. Combining these two properties proved
difficult: it is impossible to contain the spatial impact of Byzantine nodes in
a self-stabilizing context for global tasks such as tree orientation and tree
construction. We present and illustrate a new concept of Byzantine containment
in stabilization. Our property, called Strong Stabilization enables to contain
the impact of Byzantine nodes if they actually perform too many Byzantine
actions. We derive impossibility results for strong stabilization and present
strongly stabilizing protocols for tree orientation and tree construction that
are optimal with respect to the number of Byzantine nodes that can be tolerated
in a self-stabilizing context.
