Generalizing a sequence of Lambert, Cayley and Ramanujan, Chapoton has
recently introduced a polynomial sequence Q_n:=Q_n(x,y,z,t) defined by Q_1=1,
Q_{n+1}=[x+nz+(y+t)(n+y\partial_y)]Q_n. In this paper we prove Chapoton's
conjecture on the duality formula: Q_n(x,y,z,t)=Q_n(x+nz+nt,y,-t,-z), and
answer his question about the combinatorial interpretation of Q_n. Actually we
give combinatorial interpretations of these polynomials in terms of plane
trees, half-mobile trees, and forests of plane trees. Our approach also leads
to a general formula that unifies several known results for enumerating trees
and plane trees.
