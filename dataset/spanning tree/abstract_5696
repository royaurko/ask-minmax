The tree-level three-point correlation functions of local operators in the
general $(p,q)$ minimal models coupled to gravity are calculated in the
continuum approach. On one hand, the result agrees with the unitary series
($q=p+1$); and on the other hand, for $p=2, q=2k-1$, we find agreement with the
one-matrix model results.
