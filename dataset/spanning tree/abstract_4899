In this paper we consider a nearest-neighbor $p$-adic hard core (HC) model,
with fugacity $\lambda$, on a homogeneous Cayley tree of order $k$ (with $k +
1$ neighbors). We focus on $p$-adic Gibbs measures for the HC model, in
particular on $p$-adic "splitting" Gibbs measures generating a $p$-adic Markov
chain along each path on the tree. We show that the $p$-adic HC model is
completely different from real HC model: For a fixed $k$ we prove that the
$p$-adic HC model may have a splitting Gibbs measure only if $p$ divides
$2^k-1$. Moreover if $p$ divides $2^k-1$ but does not divide $k+2$ then there
exists unique translational invariant $p$-adic Gibbs measure. We also study
$p$-adic periodic splitting Gibbs measures and show that the above model admits
only translational invariant and periodic with period two (chess-board) Gibbs
measures. For $p\geq 7$ (resp. $p=2,3,5$) we give necessary and sufficient
(resp. necessary) conditions for the existence of a periodic $p$-adic measure.
For k=2 a $p$-adic splitting Gibbs measures exists if and only if p=3, in this
case we show that if $\lambda$ belongs to a $p$-adic ball of radius 1/27 then
there are precisely two periodic (non translational invariant) $p$-adic Gibbs
measures. We prove that a $p$-adic Gibbs measure is bounded if and only if
$p\ne 3$.
