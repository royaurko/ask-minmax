There are several good reasons you might want to read about uniform spanning
trees, one being that spanning trees are useful combinatorial objects. Not only
are they fundamental in algebraic graph theory and combinatorial geometry, but
they predate both of these subjects, having been used by Kirchoff in the study
of resistor networks. This article addresses the question about spanning trees
most natural to anyone in probability theory, namely what does a typical
spanning tree look like?
