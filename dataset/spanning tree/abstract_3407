Treebank formats and associated software tools are proliferating rapidly,
with little consideration for interoperability. We survey a wide variety of
treebank structures and operations, and show how they can be mapped onto the
annotation graph model, and leading to an integrated framework encompassing
tree and non-tree annotations alike. This development opens up new
possibilities for managing and exploiting multilayer annotations.
