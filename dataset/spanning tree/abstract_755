In this paper, we present an improved union bound on the Linear Programming
(LP) decoding performance of the binary linear codes transmitted over an
additive white Gaussian noise channels. The bounding technique is based on the
second-order of Bonferroni-type inequality in probability theory, and it is
minimized by Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm. The bound calculation
needs the fundamental cone generators of a given parity-check matrix rather
than only their weight spectrum, but involves relatively low computational
complexity. It is targeted to high-density parity-check codes, where the number
of their generators is extremely large and these generators are spread densely
in the Euclidean space. We explore the generator density and make a comparison
between different parity-check matrix representations. That density effects on
the improvement of the proposed bound over the conventional LP union bound. The
paper also presents a complete pseudo-weight distribution of the fundamental
cone generators for the BCH[31,21,5] code.
