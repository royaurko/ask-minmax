For the $q$-state Potts model on a Cayley tree of order $k\geq 2$ it is
well-known that at sufficiently low temperatures there are at least $q+1$
translation-invariant Gibbs measures which are also tree-indexed Markov chains.
Such measures are called translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures
(TISGMs).
  In this paper we find all TISGMs, and show in particular that at sufficiently
low temperatures their number is $2^{q}-1$. We prove that there are $[q/2]$
(where $[a]$ is the integer part of $a$) critical temperatures at which the
number of TISGMs changes and give the exact number of TISGMs for each
intermediate temperature. For the binary tree we give explicit formulae for the
critical temperatures and the possible TISGMs.
  While we show that these measures are never convex combinations of each
other, the question which of these measures are extremals in the set of all
Gibbs measures will be treated in future work.
