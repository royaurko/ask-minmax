We present a theoretical framework which is generally applicable to the study
of time scales of activated processes in systems with Brownian type dynamics.
This framework is applied to a prototype system: magnetization reversal times
in the 2D Ising model. Direct simulation results for the magnetization reversal
times, spanning more than five orders of magnitude, are compared with
theoretical predictions; the two agree in most cases within 20%.
