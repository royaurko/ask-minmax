We present a class of optimum ground states for spin-3/2 models on the Cayley
tree with coordination number 3. The interaction is restricted to nearest
neighbours and contains 5 continuous parameters. For all values of these
parameters the Hamiltonian has parity invariance, spin-flip invariance, and
rotational symmetry in the xy-plane of spin space. The global ground states are
constructed in terms of a 1-parametric vertex state model, which is a direct
generalization of the well-known matrix product ground state approach. By using
recursion relations and the transfer matrix technique we derive exact
analytical expressions for local fluctuations and longitudinal and transversal
two-point correlation functions.
