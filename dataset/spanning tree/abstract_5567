Let $K$ be a global field or $\overline{\mathbb Q}$, $F$ a nonzero quadratic
form on $K^N$, $N \geq 2$, and $V$ a subspace of $K^N$. We prove the existence
of an infinite collection of finite families of small-height maximal totally
isotropic subspaces of $(V,F)$ such that each such family spans $V$ as a
$K$-vector space. This result generalizes and extends a well known theorem of
J. Vaaler and further contributes to the effective study of quadratic forms via
height in the general spirit of Cassels' theorem on small zeros of quadratic
forms. All bounds on height are explicit.
