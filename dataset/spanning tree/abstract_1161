We prove that every simple polygon contains a degree 3 tree encompassing a
prescribed set of vertices. We give tight bounds on the minimal number of
degree 3 vertices. We apply this result to reprove a result from Bose et al.
that every set of disjoint line segments in the plane admits a binary tree.
