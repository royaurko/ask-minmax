We show that a group acting on a non-trivial tree with finite edge
stabilizers and icc vertex stabilizers admits a faithful and highly transitive
action on an infinite countable set. This result is actually true for infinite
vertex stabilizers and some more general, finite of infinite, edge stabilizers
that we call highly core-free. We study the notion of highly core-free
subgroups and give some examples. In the case of amalgamated free products over
highly core-free subgroups and HNN extensions with highly core-free base groups
we obtain a genericity result for faithful and highly transitive actions. In
particular, we recover the result of D. Kitroser stating that the fundamental
group of a closed, orientable surface of genus g>1 admits a faithful and highly
transitive action.
