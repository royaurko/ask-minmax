Multiple-Tree Overlay Streaming has attracted a great amount of attention
from researchers in the past years. Multiple-tree streaming is a promising
alternative to single-tree streaming in terms of node dynamics and load
balancing, among others, which in turn addresses the perceived video quality by
the streaming user on node dynamics or when heterogeneous nodes join the
network. This article presents a comprehensive survey of the different
aproaches and techniques used in this research area. In this paper we identify
node-disjointness as the property most approaches aim to achieve. We also
present an alternative technique which does not try to achieve this but does
local optimizations aiming global optimizations. Thus, we identify this
property as not being absolute necessary for creating robust and heterogeneous
multi-tree overlays. We identify two main design goals: robustness and support
for heterogeneity, and classify existing approaches into these categories as
their main focus.
