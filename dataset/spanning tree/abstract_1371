We study three different kinds of embeddings of tree patterns:
weakly-injective, ancestor-preserving, and lca-preserving. While each of them
is often referred to as injective embedding, they form a proper hierarchy and
their computational properties vary (from P to NP-complete). We present a
thorough study of the complexity of the model checking problem i.e., is there
an embedding of a given tree pattern in a given tree, and we investigate the
impact of various restrictions imposed on the tree pattern: bound on the degree
of a node, bound on the height, and type of allowed labels and edges.
