High-energy limit of stringy Ward identities derived from the decoupling of
two types of zero-norm states in the old covariant first quantized (OCFQ)
spectrum of open bosonic string are used to check the consistency of saddle
point calculations of high energy scattering amplitudes of Gross and Mende and
Gross and Manes. Some inconsistencies of their saddle point calculations are
found even for the string-tree scattering amplitudes of the excited string
states. We discuss and calculate the missing terms of the calculation by those
contributors to recover the stringy Ward identities. In addition, based on the
tree-level stringy Ward identities, we give the proof of a general formula,
which was proposed previously, of all high energy four-point string-tree
amplitudes of arbitrary particles in the string spectrum. In this formula all
such scattering amplitudes are expressed in terms of those of tachyons as
conjectured by Gross. The formula is extremely simple which manifestly
demonstrates the universal high energy behavior of the interactions among all
string states.
