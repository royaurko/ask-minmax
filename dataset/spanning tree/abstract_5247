Electron counting of a single porphyrin molecule between two electrodes shows
a crossover from sub- to super-Poissonian statistics as the bias voltage is
scanned. This is attributed to the simultaneous activation of states with
electron transfer rates spanning several orders of magnitude. Time-series
analysis of consecutive single electron transfer events reveals fast and slow
transport channels, which are not resolved by the average current alone.
