We define the analogue of linear equivalence of graph divisors for the
rotor-router model, and use it to prove polynomial time computability of some
problems related to rotor-routing. Using the connection between linear
equivalence for chip-firing and for rotor-routing, we prove that the number of
rotor-router unicycle-orbits equals the order of the Picard group. We also show
that the rotor-router action of the Picard group on the set of spanning
in-arborescences can be interpreted in terms of the linear equivalence.
