Sequent calculus is widely used for formalizing proofs. However, due to the
proliferation of data, understanding the proofs of even simple mathematical
arguments soon becomes impossible. Graphical user interfaces help in this
matter, but since they normally utilize Gentzen's original notation, some of
the problems persist. In this paper, we introduce a number of criteria for
proof visualization which we have found out to be crucial for analyzing proofs.
We then evaluate recent developments in tree visualization with regard to these
criteria and propose the Sunburst Tree layout as a complement to the
traditional tree structure. This layout constructs inferences as concentric
circle arcs around the root inference, allowing the user to focus on the
proof's structural content. Finally, we describe its integration into ProofTool
and explain how it interacts with the Gentzen layout.
