The main result of this paper is that for any $c>0$ and for large enough $n$
if the number of edges in a 3-uniform hypergraph is at least $cn^2$ then there
is a core (subgraph with minimum degree at least 2) on at most 15 vertices. We
conjecture that our result is not sharp and 15 can be replaced by 9. Such an
improvement seems to be out of reach, since it would imply the following case
of a long-standing conjecture by Brown, Erd\H os, and S\'os; if there is no set
of 9 vertices that span at least 6 edges of a 3-uniform hypergraph then it is
sparse.
