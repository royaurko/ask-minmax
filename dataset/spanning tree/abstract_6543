We introduce two new concepts designed for the study of empirical processes.
First, we introduce a new Orlicz norm which we call the Bernstein-Orlicz norm.
This new norm interpolates sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential tail behavior. In
particular, we show how this norm can be used to simplify the derivation of
deviation inequalities for suprema of collections of random variables.
Secondly, we introduce chaining and generic chaining along a tree. These
simplify the well-known concepts of chaining and generic chaining. The supremum
of the empirical process is then studied as a special case. We show that
chaining along a tree can be done using entropy with bracketing. Finally, we
establish a deviation inequality for the empirical process for the unbounded
case.
