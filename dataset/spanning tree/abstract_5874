Learning in Riemannian orbifolds is motivated by existing machine learning
algorithms that directly operate on finite combinatorial structures such as
point patterns, trees, and graphs. These methods, however, lack statistical
justification. This contribution derives consistency results for learning
problems in structured domains and thereby generalizes learning in vector
spaces and manifolds.
