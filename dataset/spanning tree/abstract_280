Allometry and growth rates of 8 forest species in the UK. The data were
collected from two United Kingdom woodlands - Wytham Woods and Alice Holt. Here
we present data from 582 individual trees of eight taxa in the form of summary
variables. In addition the raw data files containing the variables from which
the summary data were obtained. Large sample sizes with longitudinal data
spanning 22 years make these datasets useful for future studies concerned with
the way trees change in size and shape over their life-span. The allometric
relationships include (1) trunk diameter, (2) height, (3) crown height, (4)
crown radius and (5) trunk radial growth rate to (A) the light environment of
each tree and (B) diameter at breast height.
