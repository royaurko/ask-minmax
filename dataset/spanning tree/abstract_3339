It is demonstrated that Kerr frequency comb generation described by coupled
mode equations can be numerically simulated using Fast Fourier Transform
methods. This allows broadband frequency combs spanning a full octave to be
efficiently simulated using standard algorithms, resulting in orders of
magnitude improvements in the computation time.
