We study the form factor of a generic gauge-invariant local composite
operator in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory. At tree level and for a minimal number
of external on-shell super fields, we find that the form factor precisely
yields the spin-chain picture of integrability in the language of scattering
amplitudes. Moreover, we compute the cut-constructible part of the one-loop
correction to this minimal form factor via generalised unitarity. From its UV
divergence, we obtain the complete one-loop dilatation operator of
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory. Thus, we provide a field-theoretic derivation of a
relation between the one-loop dilatation operator and the four-point tree-level
amplitude which was observed earlier. We also comment on the implications of
our findings in the context of integrability.
