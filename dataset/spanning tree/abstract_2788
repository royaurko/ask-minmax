It is known that subtree overlap graphs are equivalent to subtree filament
graphs. We show the equivalence of subtree filament and subtree overlap classes
of limited host trees, and relate this to the $\mathcal{G}$-mixed
characterisations used by Gavril (2000). As a consequence of this result, we
have that caterpillar overlap graphs are equivalent to interval filament
graphs.
