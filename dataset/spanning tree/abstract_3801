We present the phylogeny analysis software SICLE (Sister Clade Extractor), an
easy to use, adaptable, and high-throughput tool to describe the nearest
neighbors to a node of interest in a phylogenetic tree as well as the support
value for the relationship. With SICLE it is possible to summarize the
phylogenetic information produced by automated phylogenetic pipelines to
rapidly identify and quantify the possible evolutionary relationships that
merit further investigation. The program is a simple command line utility and
is easy to adapt and implement in any phylogenetic pipeline. As a test case, we
applied this new tool to published gene phylogenies to identify potential
instances of horizontal gene transfer in Salinibacter ruber.
