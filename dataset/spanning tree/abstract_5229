The paper contains a proposal for an energy and time representation. We
construct modes that correspond to fuzzy distributions around discrete values
of energy or time. The modes form an orthogonal and complete set in the space
of square integrable functions. Energy and time are self adjoint in the space
spanned by the modes. The widths of the modes are analyzed as well as their
energy-time uncertainty relations. The lower uncertainty attainable for the
modes is shown. We also show times of arrival for massless particles.
