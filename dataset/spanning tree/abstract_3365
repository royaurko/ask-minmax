The Hamiltonian number of a connected graph is the minimum of the lengths of
the closed, spanning walks in the graph. In 1968, Grinberg published a
necessary condition for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in a planar graph,
formulated in terms of the lengths of its face cycles. We show how Grinberg's
theorem can be adapted to provide a lower bound on the Hamiltonian number of a
planar graph.
