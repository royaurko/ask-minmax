The metric dimension of a graph is the size of the smallest set of vertices
whose distances distinguish all pairs of vertices in the graph. We show that
this graph invariant may be calculated by an algorithm whose running time is
linear in the input graph size, added to a function of the largest possible
number of leaves in a spanning tree of the graph.
