We study the relationship between several constructions of symplectic
realizations of a given Poisson manifold. We show that, for an arbitrary
Poisson structure on Rn, the realization given by the tree-level part of
Kontsevich star-product coincides with the one given by a formal version of the
original construction of Weinstein, when suitably put in global Darboux form.
We give an explicit formula for this realization in terms of rooted trees
involving only computable Kontsevich's weights, for which we set up a simple
iterated integral, building on results of Kathotia.
