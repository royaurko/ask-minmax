Tree level decay amplitudes of near-BPS D-brane configurations are known to
exactly reproduce Hawking radiation rates from corresponding black holes at low
energies even though the brane configurations describe semiclassical black
holes only when the open string couplings are large. We show that a large class
of one (open string) loop corrections to emission processes from D-branes
vanish at low energies and nonvanishing loop contributions have an energy
dependence consistent with black hole answers, thus providing a justification
for the agreement of the tree level results with semiclassical answers.
