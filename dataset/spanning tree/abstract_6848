In order to deal with the systematic verification with uncertain infromation
in possibility theory, Li and Li \cite{li12} introduced model checking of
linear-time properties in which the uncertainty is modeled by possibility
measures. Xue, Lei and Li \cite{Xue09} defined computation tree logic (CTL)
based on possibility measures, which is called possibilistic CTL (PoCTL). This
paper is a continuation of the above work. First, we study the expressiveness
of PoCTL. Unlike probabilistic CTL, it is shown that PoCTL (in particular,
qualitative PoCTL) is more powerful than CTL with respect to their
expressiveness. The equivalent expressions of basic CTL formulae using
qualitative PoCTL formulae are presented in detail. Some PoCTL formulae that
can not be expressed by any CTL formulae are presented. In particular, some
qualitative properties of repeated reachability and persistence are expressed
using PoCTL formulae. Next, adapting CTL model-checking algorithm, a method to
solve the PoCTL model-checking problem and its time complexity are discussed in
detail. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the PoCTL model-checking
method.
