Given a category with a bifunctor and natural isomorphisms for associativity,
commutativity and left and right identity we do not assume that extra
constraining diagrams hold. We introduce groupoids of coupling trees to
describe a version of coherence that is weaker than the usual notion of
monoidal coherence.
