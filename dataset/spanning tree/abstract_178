Given a spanning forest on a large square lattice, we consider by
combinatorial methods a correlation function of $k$ paths ($k$ is odd) along
branches of trees or, equivalently, $k$ loop--erased random walks. Starting and
ending points of the paths are grouped in a fashion a $k$--leg watermelon. For
large distance $r$ between groups of starting and ending points, the ratio of
the number of watermelon configurations to the total number of spanning trees
behaves as $r^{-\nu} \log r$ with $\nu = (k^2-1)/2$. Considering the spanning
forest stretched along the meridian of this watermelon, we see that the
two--dimensional $k$--leg loop--erased watermelon exponent $\nu$ is converting
into the scaling exponent for the reunion probability (at a given point) of $k$
(1+1)--dimensional vicious walkers, $\tilde{\nu} = k^2/2$. Also, we express the
conjectures about the possible relation to integrable systems.
