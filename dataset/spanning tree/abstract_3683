Security of computers and the networks that connect them is increasingly
becoming of great significance. Intrusion detection system is one of the
security defense tools for computer networks. This paper compares two different
model Approaches for representing intrusion detection system by using decision
tree techniques. These approaches are Phase-model approach and Level-model
approach. Each model is implemented by using two techniques, New Attacks and
Data partitioning techniques. The experimental results showed that Phase
approach has higher classification rate in both New Attacks and Data
Partitioning techniques than Level approach.
