We present results for the renormalisation constants of bilinear quark
operators, using the Nf=2 twisted mass Wilson action at maximal twist (which
guarantees automatic O(a) improvement) and the tree-level Symanzik improved
gauge action. The scale-independent renormalisation constants are computed with
a new method, which makes use of both standard twisted mass and
Osterwalder-Seiler fermions. Moreover, the results from an RI-MOM calculation
are presented for both scale independent and scale dependent renormalisation
constants.
