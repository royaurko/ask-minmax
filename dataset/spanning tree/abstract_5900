We give another proof that $m$-dissimilarity vectors of weighted trees are
points on the tropical Grassmanian, as conjectured by Cools, and proved by
Giraldo in response to a question of Sturmfels and Pachter. We accomplish this
by relating $m$-dissimilarity vectors to the representation theory of $SL_m.$
