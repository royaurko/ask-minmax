The existence of a weak survival region is established for the anisotropic
symmetric contact process on a homogeneous tree T_{2d} of degree 2d > 2: For
parameter values in a certain connected region of positive Lebesgue measure,
the population survives forever with positive probability but ultimately
vacates every finite subset of the tree with probability one. In this phase,
infection trails must converge to the geometric boundary \Omega of the tree.
The random subset \Lambda of the boundary consisting of all ends of the tree in
which the infection survives, called the limit set of the process, is shown to
have Hausdorff dimension no larger than one half the Hausdorff dimension of the
entire geometric boundary. In addition, there is strict inequality at the
transition between weak and strong survival except when the contact process is
isotropic. It is further shown that in all cases there is a distinguished
probability measure \mu, supported by \Omega, such that the Hausdorff dimension
of \Lambda \cap \Omega_{\mu}, where \Omega_{\mu} is the set of \mu-generic
points of \Omega, converges to one half the Hausdorff dimension of \Omega_{\mu}
at the phase separation points. Exact formulae for the Hausdorff dimensions of
\Lambda and \Lambda \cap \Omega_{\mu} are obtained. We also prove that the
contact process at the transition between extinction and weak survival does not
survive. The method developed shows that the contact process at the phase
transition to strong survival survives weakly for d > 1.
