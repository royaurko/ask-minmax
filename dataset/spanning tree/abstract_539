We define the notion of circular words, then consider on such words a
constraint derived from the Fibonacci condition. We give several results on the
structure of these circular words, then mention possible applications to
various situations: periodic expansion of numbers in numeration systems,
"gcd-property" of integer sequences, partition of the prefix of the fixed point
of the Fibonacci substitution, spanning trees of a wheel. Eventually, we
mention some open questions.
