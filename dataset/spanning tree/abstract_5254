Let $\gtl$ be an affine Lie algebra of type $D_{\ell}^{(1)}$ and $L(\Lambda)$
its standard module with a highest weight vector $v_{\Lambda}$. For a given
$\Z$-gradation $\gtl = \gtl_{-1} + \gtl_0 + \gtl_1$, we define
Feigin-Stoyanovsky's type subspace as $$W(\Lambda) = U(\gtl_1) \cdot
v_{\Lambda}.$$ By using vertex operator relations for standard modules we
reduce the Ponicar\'{e}-Brikhoff-Witt spanning set of $W(\Lambda)$ to a basis
and prove its linear independence by using Dong-Lepowsky intertwining
operators.
