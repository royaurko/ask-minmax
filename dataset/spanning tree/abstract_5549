We study the coupled disc-jet system around the black hole where the outflow
solutions are obtained in terms of the inflow parameters. We observe that an
advective accretion disc can eject outflows/jets for wide range of viscosity
parameter. However, such possibility is reduced if the cooling is active as the
energy dissipative process inside the disc. For mass outflow, we obtain the
parameter space spanned by the inflow angular momentum and the viscosity in
terms of cooling and quantify the limits of viscosity parameter.
