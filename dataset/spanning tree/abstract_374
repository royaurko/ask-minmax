We give a short and direct proof of a remarkable identity that arises in the
enumeration of labeled trees with respect to their indegree sequence, where all
edges are oriented from the vertex with lower label towards the vertex with
higher label. This solves a problem posed by Shin and Zeng in a recent article.
We also provide a generalization of this identity that translates to a formula
for the number of rooted spanning forests with given indegree sequence.
