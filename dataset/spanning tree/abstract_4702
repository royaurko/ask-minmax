We investigate the algebra of repeated integrals of semimartingales. We prove
that a minimal family of semimartingales generates a quasi-shuffle algebra. In
essence, to fulfill the minimality criterion, first, the family must be a
minimal generator of the algebra of repeated integrals generated by its
elements and by quadratic covariation processes recursively constructed from
the elements of the family. Second, recursively constructed quadratic
covariation processes may lie in the linear span of previously constructed ones
and of the family, but may not lie in the linear span of repeated integrals of
these. We prove that a finite family of independent Levy processes that have
finite moments generates a minimal family. Key to the proof are the Teugels
martingales and a strong orthogonalization of them. We conclude that a finite
family of independent Levy processes form a quasi-shuffle algebra. We discuss
important potential applications to constructing efficient numerical methods
for the strong approximation of stochastic differential equations driven by
Levy processes.
