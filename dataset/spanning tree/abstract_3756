Self-stabilization is a versatile approach to fault-tolerance since it
permits a distributed system to recover from any transient fault that
arbitrarily corrupts the contents of all memories in the system. Byzantine
tolerance is an attractive feature of distributed systems that permits to cope
with arbitrary malicious behaviors. We consider the well known problem of
constructing a maximum metric tree in this context. Combining these two
properties leads to some impossibility results. In this paper, we provide two
necessary conditions to construct maximum metric tree in presence of transients
and (permanent) Byzantine faults.
