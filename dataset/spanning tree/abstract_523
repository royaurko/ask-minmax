We study the fibration of augmented link complements. Given the diagram of an
augmented link we associate a spanning surface and a graph. We then show that
this surface is a fiber for the link complement if and only if the associated
graph is a tree. We further show that fibration is preserved under Dehn filling
on certain components of these links. This last result is then used to prove
that within a very large class of links, called locally alternating augmented
links, every link is fibered.
