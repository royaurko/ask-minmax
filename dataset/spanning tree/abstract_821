P\'olya trees are rooted unordered trees considered up to symmetry. We
establish the convergence of uniform random P\'olya trees with arbitrary degree
restrictions to Aldous's Continuum Random Tree with respect to the
Gromov-Hausdorff metric. Our proof is short and elementary, and it shows that a
random P\'olya tree contains in a well-defined sense a large simply generated
tree that is decorated with small forests.
