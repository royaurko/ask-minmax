It is a well-known procedure for constructing a torus knot or link that first
we prepare an unknotted torus and meridian disks in the complementary solid
tori of it, and second smooth the intersections of the boundary of meridian
disks uniformly. Then we obtain a torus knot or link on the unknotted torus and
its Seifert surface made of meridian disks. In the present paper, we generalize
this procedure by a closed fake surface and show that the resultant two
surfaces obtained by smoothing triple points uniformly are essential. We also
show that a knot obtained by this procedure satisfies the Neuwirth conjecture,
and the distance of two boundary slopes for the knot is equal to the number of
triple points of the closed fake surface.
