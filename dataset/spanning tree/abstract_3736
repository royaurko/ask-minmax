We study all tree-level split helicity gluon amplitudes by using the recently
proposed BCFW recursion relation and Hodges diagrams in ambitwistor space. We
pick out the contributing diagrams and find that all of them can be divided
into triangles in a suitable way. We give the explicit expressions for all of
these amplitudes. As an example, we reproduce the six gluon split NMHV
amplitudes in momentum space.
