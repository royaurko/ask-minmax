Tree alignment graphs (TAGs) provide an intuitive data structure for storing
phylogenetic trees that exhibits the relationships of the individual input
trees and can potentially account for nested taxonomic relationships. This
paper provides a theoretical foundation for the use of TAGs in phylogenetics.
We provide a formal definition of TAG that - unlike previous definition - does
not depend on the order in which input trees are provided. In the consensus
case, when all input trees have the same leaf labels, we describe algorithms
for constructing majority-rule and strict consensus trees using the TAG. When
the input trees do not have identical sets of leaf labels, we describe how to
determine if the input trees are compatible and, if they are compatible, to
construct a supertree that contains the input trees.
