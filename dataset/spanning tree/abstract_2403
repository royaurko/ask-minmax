We show that a relatively hyperbolic group quasi-isometrically embeds in a
product of finitely many trees if the peripheral subgroups do, and we provide
an estimate on the minimal number of trees needed. Applying our result to the
case of 3-manifolds, we show that fundamental groups of closed 3-manifolds have
linearly controlled asymptotic dimension at most 8. To complement this result,
we observe that fundamental groups of Haken 3-manifolds with non-empty boundary
have asymptotic dimension 2.
