The Surjective Homomorphism problem is to test whether a given graph G called
the guest graph allows a vertex-surjective homomorphism to some other given
graph H called the host graph. The bijective and injective homomorphism
problems can be formulated in terms of spanning subgraphs and subgraphs, and as
such their computational complexity has been extensively studied. What about
the surjective variant? Because this problem is NP-complete in general, we
restrict the guest and the host graph to belong to graph classes G and H,
respectively. We determine to what extent a certain choice of G and H
influences its computational complexity. We observe that the problem is
polynomial-time solvable if H is the class of paths, whereas it is NP-complete
if G is the class of paths. Moreover, we show that the problem is even
NP-complete on many other elementary graph classes, namely linear forests,
unions of complete graphs, cographs, proper interval graphs, split graphs and
trees of pathwidth at most 2. In contrast, we prove that the problem is
fixed-parameter tractable in k if G is the class of trees and H is the class of
trees with at most k leaves, or if G and H are equal to the class of graphs
with vertex cover number at most k.
