This paper defines a generalized column subset selection problem which is
concerned with the selection of a few columns from a source matrix A that best
approximate the span of a target matrix B. The paper then proposes a fast
greedy algorithm for solving this problem and draws connections to different
problems that can be efficiently solved using the proposed algorithm.
