We propose a new, direct, correlation-free approach based on central moments
of profiles to the asymptotics of width (size of the most abundant level) in
some random trees of logarithmic height. The approach is simple but gives
precise estimates for expected width, central moments of the width and almost
sure convergence. It is widely applicable to random trees of logarithmic
height, including recursive trees, binary search trees, quad trees,
plane-oriented ordered trees and other varieties of increasing trees.
