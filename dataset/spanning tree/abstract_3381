The ground state configurations of the one--dimensional Falicov--Kimball
model are studied exactly with numerical calculations revealing unexpected
effects for small interaction strength. In neutral systems we observe molecular
formation, phase separation and changes in the conducting properties; while in
non--neutral systems the phase diagram exhibits Farey tree order (Aubry
sequence) and a devil's staircase structure. Conjectures are presented for the
boundary of the segregated domain and the general structure of the ground
states.
