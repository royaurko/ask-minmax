A c++ implementation of the D_s-dimensional unitarity cut algorithm for the
numerical evaluation of the virtual contribution to NLO QCD amplitudes is
presented. The current version includes an arbitrary number of external gluons
with gluonic propagators in the loop. The building blocks are tree level
color-ordered amplitudes with gluons and with gluons and two scalars in five
dimensions. Numerical stability issues are addressed and agreement has been
reached with the results published in the literature.
