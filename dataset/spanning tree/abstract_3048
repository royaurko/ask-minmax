Let $T$ be a tree and $e$ an edge in $T$. If $C$ is a component of
$T\setminus e$ and both $C$ and its complement are infinite we say that $C$ is
a half-tree. The main result of this paper is that if $G$ is a closed subgroup
of the automorphism group of $T$ and $G$ leaves no non-trivial subtree
invariant and fixes no end of $T$ then the subgroup generated by the pointwise
stabilizers of half-trees is topologically simple. This result is used to
derive analogues of recent results of Caprace and De Medts (2011) and it is
also applied in the study of the full automorphism group of a locally finite
primitive graph with infinitely many ends.
