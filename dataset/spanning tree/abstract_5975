The algorithm of Micali and Vazirani \cite{MV} finds a maximum cardinality
matching in time $O(\sqrt n m)$ if an efficient set-merging algorithm is used.
The latter is provided by the incremental-tree set-merging algorithm of
\cite{GabTar}. Details of this application to matching were omitted from
\cite{GabTar} and are presented in this note.
