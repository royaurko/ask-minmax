Let $G$ be a finite group. In [HTW], Hambleton, Taylor and Williams have
considered the question of comparing Mackey functors for $G$ and biset functors
defined on subgroups of $G$ and bifree bisets as morphisms. This paper proposes
a different approach to this problem, from the point of view of various
categories of $G$-sets. In particular, the category of fused $G$-sets is
introduced, as well its category of spans. The fused Mackey functors for $G$
over a commutative ring $R$ are defined as $R$-linear functors from this
($R$-linearized) category of spans to $R$-modules. They form an abelian
subcategory of the category of Mackey functors for $G$ over $R$, equivalent
(for $R=Z$) to the category to the category of conjugation Mackey functors of
[HTW]. The category of fused Mackey functors is also equivalent to the category
of modules over the fused Mackey algebra, which is a quotient of the usual
Mackey algebra of $G$ over $R$. Reference: [HTW] I. Hambleton, L. R. Taylor,
