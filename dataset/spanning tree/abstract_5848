Forester has defined spaces of simplicial tree actions for a finitely
generated group, called deformation spaces. Culler and Vogtmann's Outer space
is an example of a deformation space. Using ideas from Skora's proof of the
contractibility of Outer space, we show that under some mild hypotheses
deformation spaces are contractible.
