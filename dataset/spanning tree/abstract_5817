A group G has property FA if G fixes a point of every tree on which G acts
without inversions. We prove that every Coxeter system of finite rank has a
visual JSJ decomposition over subgroups with property FA. As an application, we
reduce the twist conjecture to Coxeter systems that are indecomposable with
respect to amalgamated products over visual subgroups with property FA.
