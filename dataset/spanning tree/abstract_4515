We study a continuous time Markov process whose state space consists of an
assignment of +1 or -1 to each vertex of a graph G. The graphs that we treat
are related to homogeneous trees of degree K $\geq$ 3, such as finite or
infinite stacks of such trees. The initial spin configuration is chosen from a
Bernoulli product measure with density $\theta$ of +1 spins. The system evolves
according to an agreement inducing dynamics: each vertex, at rate 1, changes
its spin value to agree with the majority of its neighbors. We study the long
time behavior of this system and prove that, if $\theta$ is close enough to 1,
the system reaches fixation to consensus. The geometric percolation-type
arguments introduced here may be of independent interest.
