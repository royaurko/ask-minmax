We study Gibbs properties of the fuzzy Potts model in the mean field case
(i.e on a complete graph) and on trees. For the mean field case, a complete
characterization of the set of temperatures for which non-Gibbsianness happens
is given. The results for trees are somewhat less explicit, but we do show for
general trees that non-Gibbsianness of the fuzzy Potts model happens exactly
for those temperatures where the underlying Potts model has multiple Gibbs
measures.
