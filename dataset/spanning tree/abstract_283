The study of tree-indexed stochastic processes is of special interest in
understanding evolutionary biological questions. An instance of such a process
is obtained by considering a phylogenetic or evolutionary tree, with vertices
representing species and edges representing evolutionary relationships among
them, and associating a (random) fitness value to each individual.
  In this work we consider the accessibility percolation model on spherically
symmetric trees. The model is defined by associating an absolute continuous
random variable $X_v$ to each vertex $v$ of the tree. The main question to be
considered is the existence or not of an infinite path of nearest neighbours
$v_1,v_2,v_3...$ such that $X_{v_1}<X_{v_2}<X_{v_3}<...$ and which span the
entire graph. The event defined by the existence of such path is called
{\it{percolation}}.
  We obtain sufficient conditions under which either there is percolation or
not with positive probability. In particular, we show that if the tree has a
linear growing function given by $f(i)= \lceil(i+1) \alpha \rceil$ then there
is a percolation threshold at $\alpha_c =1$ such that there is percolation if
$\alpha> 1$ and there is no percolation if $\alpha \leq 1$.
  Our model may be seen as a simple stochastic model for evolutionary trees.
Different levels of the spherically symmetric tree represent different
{\it{generations}} of species and the degree of each vertex represents the mean
number of offspring species which appear in fixed intervals of time. In this
sense, the varying environment of the tree is translated as a varying mutation
rate.
