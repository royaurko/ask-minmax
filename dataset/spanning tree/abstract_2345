We describe an adaptive context tree weighting (ACTW) algorithm, as an
extension to the standard context tree weighting (CTW) algorithm. Unlike the
standard CTW algorithm, which weights all observations equally regardless of
the depth, ACTW gives increasing weight to more recent observations, aiming to
improve performance in cases where the input sequence is from a non-stationary
distribution. Data compression results show ACTW variants improving over CTW on
merged files from standard compression benchmark tests while never being
significantly worse on any individual file.
