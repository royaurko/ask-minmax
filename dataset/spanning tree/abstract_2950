We study a model of growing planar tree graphs where in each time step we
separate the tree into two components by splitting a vertex and then connect
the two pieces by inserting a new link between the daughter vertices. This
model generalises the preferential attachment model and Ford's $\alpha$-model
for phylogenetic trees. We develop a mean field theory for the vertex degree
distribution, prove that the mean field theory is exact in some special cases
and check that it agrees with numerical simulations in general. We calculate
various correlation functions and show that the intrinsic Hausdorff dimension
can vary from one to infinity, depending on the parameters of the model.
