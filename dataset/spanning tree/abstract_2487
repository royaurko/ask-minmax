Consider a random recusive tree with n vertices. We show that the number of
vertices with even depth is asymptotically normal as n tends to infinty. The
same is true for the number of vertices of depth divisible by m for m=3, 4 or
5; in all four cases the variance grows linearly. On the other hand, for m at
least 7, the number is not asymptotically normal, and the variance grows faster
than linear in n. The case m=6 is intermediate: the number is asymptotically
normal but the variance is of order n log n.
  This is a simple and striking example of a type of phase transition that has
been observed by other contributors in several cases. We prove, and perhaps explain,
this non-intuitive behavious using a translation to a generalized Polya urn.
  Similar results hold for a random binary search tree; now the number of
vertices of depth divisible by m is asymptotically normal for m at most 8 but
not for m at least 9, and the variance grows linearly in the first case both
faster in the second. (There is no intermediate case.)
  In contrast, we show that for conditioned Galton-Watson trees, including
random labelled trees and random binary trees, there is no such phase
transition: the number is asymptotically normal for every m.
