The statistical estimation of phylogenies is always associated with
uncertainty, and accommodating this uncertainty is an important component of
modern phylogenetic comparative analysis. The birth-death polytomy resolver is
a method of accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty that places missing
(unsampled) taxa onto phylogenetic trees, using taxonomic information alone.
Recent studies of birds and mammals have used this approach to generate
pseudo-posterior distributions of phylogenetic trees that are complete at the
species level, even in the absence of genetic data for many species. Many
researchers have used these distributions of phylogenies for downstream
evolutionary analyses that involve inferences on phenotypic evolution,
geography, and community assembly. I demonstrate that the use of phylogenies
constructed in this fashion is inappropriate for many questions involving
traits. Because species are placed on trees at random with respect to trait
values, the birth-death polytomy resolver breaks down natural patterns of trait
phylogenetic structure. Inferences based on these trees are predictably and
often drastically biased in a direction that depends on the underlying (true)
pattern of phylogenetic structure in traits. I illustrate the severity of the
phenomenon for both continuous and discrete traits using examples from a global
bird phylogeny.
