The minimum spanning tree, based on the concept of ultrametricity, is
constructed from the correlation matrix of stock returns. The dynamics of this
asset tree can be characterised by its normalised length and the mean
occupation layer, as measured from an appropriately chosen centre called the
`central node'. We show how the tree length shrinks during a stock market
crisis, Black Monday in this case, and how a strong reconfiguration takes
place, resulting in topological shrinking of the tree.
