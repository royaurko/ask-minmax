We relate the contributor's Lie cobracket in the module additively generated by
loops on a surface with the Connes-Kreimer Lie bracket in the module additively
generated by trees. To this end we introduce a pre-Lie coalgebra and a
(commutative) Hopf algebra of pointed loops on a surface. In the last version I
added sections on Wilson loops and knot diagrams.
