Recent CP asymmetry measurements in tree-dominated processes, $B^0\to
\pi^+\pi^-, \rho^+\rho^-, \rho^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}, B^+\to DK^+$, and in
penguin-dominated decays, $B \to \pi^0 K_S, \eta' K_S, \phi K_S$, are
interpreted in the framework of the Kobayashi-Maskawa (KM) mechanism of CP
violation. The KM phase emerges as the dominant source of CP violation in
tree-dominated decays, which are beginning to constrain the unitarity triangle
beyond other constraints. Improving precision of CP asymmetry measurements in
penguin-dominated decays may indicate the need for new physics.
