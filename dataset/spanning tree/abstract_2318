We explicitly calculate the distance dependent correlation functions in a
maximal entropy ensemble of random trees. We show that correlations remain
disassortative at all distances and vanish only as a second inverse power of
the distance. We discuss in detail the example of scale-free trees where the
diverging second moment of the degree distribution leads to some interesting
phenomena.
