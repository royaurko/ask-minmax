Andr\'e proved that the number of alternating permutations on $\{1, 2, \dots,
n\}$ is equal to the Euler number $E_n$. A refinement of Andr\'e's result was
given by Entringer, who proved that counting alternating permutations according
to the first element gives rise to Seidel's triangle $(E_{n,k})$ for computing
the Euler numbers. In a series of papers, using generating function method and
induction, Poupard gave several further combinatorial interpretations for
$E_{n,k}$ both in alternating permutations and increasing trees. Kuznetsov,
Pak, and Postnikov have given more combinatorial interpretations of $E_{n,k}$
in the model of trees. The aim of this paper is to provide bijections between
the different models for $E_{n,k}$ as well as some new interpretations. In
particular, we give the first explicit one-to-one correspondence between
Entringer's alternating permutation model and Poupard's increasing tree model.
