In this talk I discuss properties of the two Symanzik polynomials which
characterise the integrand of an arbitrary multi-loop integral in its Feynman
parametric form. Based on the construction from spanning forests and Laplacian
matrices, Dodgson's relation is applied to derive factorisation identities
involving both polynomials. An application of Whitney's 2-isomorphism theorem
on matroids is discussed.
