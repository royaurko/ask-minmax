GRB 080319B is one of the brightest and most extensively sampled bursts. It
has good coverage at many wavelengths. Here we present the optical observations
of the Palomar 60 inch telescope, which spans a long time interval after the
burst. We augment the optical dataset with freely available Swift BAT and XRT
observations reduced by us. We also compare our conclusions with the published
parameters from the rich literature about this burst.
