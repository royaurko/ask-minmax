In this article we introduce the concepts of S-parking function and S-parking
set for sets to extend the concept of G-parking function for graphs. It is
shown that there exist bijections between S-parking functions and S-parking
sets. Applying this result to a finite matroid $M$, we obtain bijections
between S-parking functions and bases in $M$. In particular, we apply this
result to obtain the well-know result that bijections exist between G-parking
functions of any connected graph $G$ and spanning trees of $G$.
