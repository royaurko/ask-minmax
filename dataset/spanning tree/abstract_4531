We present a $\lg n + 2 \lg \lg n+3$ ancestry labeling scheme for trees. The
problem was first presented by Kannan et al. [STOC 88'] along with a simple $2
\lg n$ solution. Motivated by applications to XML files, the label size was
improved incrementally over the course of more than 20 years by a series of
papers. The last, due to Fraigniaud and Korman [STOC 10'], presented an
asymptotically optimal $\lg n + 4 \lg \lg n+O(1)$ labeling scheme using
non-trivial tree-decomposition techniques. By providing a framework
generalizing interval based labeling schemes, we obtain a simple, yet
asymptotically optimal solution to the problem. Furthermore, our labeling
scheme is attained by a small modification of the original $2 \lg n$ solution.
