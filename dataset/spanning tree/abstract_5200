A good quality scaling of the cluster size distributions is obtained for the
Lattice Gas Model using the Fisher's ansatz for the scaling function. This
scaling identifies a pseudo-critical line in the phase diagram of the model
that spans the whole (subcritical to supercritical) density range. The
independent cluster hypothesis of the Fisher approach is shown to describe
correctly the thermodynamics of the lattice only far away from the critical
point.
