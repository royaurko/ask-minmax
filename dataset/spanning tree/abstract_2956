Let $T$ be a tree with induced partial order $\preceq$. We investigate
centered Gaussian processes $X=(X_t)_{t\in T}$ represented as $$
  X_t=\sigma(t)\sum_{v \preceq t}\alpha(v)\xi_v $$ for given weight functions
$\alpha$ and $\sigma$ on $T$ and with $(\xi_v)_{v\in T}$ i.i.d. standard
normal. In a first part we treat general trees and weights and derive necessary
and sufficient conditions for the a.s. boundedness of $X$ in terms of
compactness properties of $(T,d)$. Here $d$ is a special metric defined via
$\alpha$ and $\sigma$, which, in general, is not comparable with the Dudley
metric generated by $X$. In a second part we investigate the boundedness of $X$
for the binary tree and for homogeneous weights. Assuming some mild regularity
assumptions about $\alpha$ we completely characterize weights $\alpha$ and
$\sigma$ with $X$ being a.s. bounded.
