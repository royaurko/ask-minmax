We present an optimized and physically motivated method for separating top
quark signal events from background events at the Tevatron. For the top quark
signal $t\bar t \to e/\mu + 4$ jets, we show how to reject all but $25\%$ of
the background in a data sample while retaining $80\%$ of the signal, without
introducing bias into the subsequent mass measurement. The technique used is
the Binary Decision Tree. Combining this highly efficient procedure for signal
identification with a novel algorithm for top quark reconstruction, we propose
a powerful new way to measure the top quark mass.
