A compact closed bicategory is a symmetric monoidal bicategory where every
object is equipped with a weak dual. The unit and counit satisfy the usual
"zig-zag" identities of a compact closed category only up to natural
isomorphism, and the isomorphism is subject to a coherence law. We give several
examples of compact closed bicategories, then review previous work. In
particular, Day and Street defined compact closed bicategories indirectly via
Gray monoids and then appealed to a coherence theorem to extend the concept to
bicategories; we restate the definition directly.
  We prove that given a 2-category T with finite products and weak pullbacks,
the bicategory of objects of C, spans, and isomorphism classes of maps of spans
is compact closed. As corollaries, the bicategory of spans of sets and certain
bicategories of "resistor networks" are compact closed.
