For a ring $R$, we denote by $R[\mathcal L]$ the free $R$-module spanned by
the isotopy classes of singular links in $\mathbb S^3$. Given two invertible
elements $x,t \in R$, the HOMFLY-PT skein module of singular links in $\mathbb
S^3$ (relative to the triple $(R,t,x)$) is the quotient of $R[\mathcal L]$ by
local relations, called skein relations, that involve $t$ and $x$. We compute
the HOMFLY-PT skein module of singular links for any $R$ such that
$(t^{-1}-t+x)$ and $(t^{-1}-t-x)$ are invertible. In particular, we deduce the
Conway skein module of singular links.
