We present examples of rooted tree graphs for which the Laplacian has
singular continuous spectral measures. For some of these examples we further
establish fractional Hausdorff dimensions. The singular continuous components,
in these models, have an interesting multiplicity structure. The results are
obtained via a decomposition of the Laplacian into a direct sum of Jacobi
matrices.
