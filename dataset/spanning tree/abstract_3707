We consider models with nearest-neighbor interactions and with the set
$[0,1]$ of spin values, on a Cayley tree of order $k\geq 1$. We study periodic
Gibbs measures of the model with period two. For $k=1$ we show that there is no
any periodic Gibbs measure. In case $k\geq 2$ we get a sufficient condition on
Hamiltonian of the model with uncountable set of spin values under which the
model have not any periodic Gibbs measure with period two. We construct several
models which have at least two periodic Gibbs measures.
