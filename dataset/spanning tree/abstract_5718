We study the radiative corrections of the noncommutative QED at the one-loop
level. A correction of the magnetic dipole moment due to the noncommutativity
are evaluated. As in the ordinary QED, IR divergence is shown to vanish when we
combine both the tree level Bremsstrahlung diagram and the one-loop electron
vertex function.
