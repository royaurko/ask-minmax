We study compactification of five dimensional ungauged N=2 supergravity
coupled to vector- and hypermultiplets on orbifold $S^1/Z_2$. In the model the
vector multiplets scalar manifold is arbitrary while the hypermultiplet scalars
span a generalized self dual Einstein manifold constructed by Calderbank and
Pedersen. The bosonic and the fermionic sector of the low energy effective N=1
supergravity in four dimensions are derived.
