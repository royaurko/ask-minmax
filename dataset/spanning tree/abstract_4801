We investigate the neutral Higgs sector in the next-to-minimal supersymmetric
standard model (NMSSM) with explicit CP violation at the one-loop level by
using the effective potential method. In general, explicit CP violation is
possible at the tree-level in the Higgs potential of the NMSSM, which may
possess a complex phase. The tree-level Higgs potential can be made CP
conserving by assuming that all the relevant parameters are real. However, the
CP-conserving Higgs potential at the tree level may still develop complex
phases at the one-loop level through radiative corrections. These complex
phases exhibit explicit CP violation through the mixings between the scalar and
pseudoscalar Higgs bosons. One of the complex phases arise in the neutralino
sector. For a particular choice of the relevant parameter values, the
scalar-pseudoscalar mixings are found to strongly dependent on this phase.
Meanwhile, for a wide region in the parameter space, the ratios of CP mixing
elements of the neutral Higgs boson mass matrix to CP non-mixing ones increase
weakly against this phase. Also, the neutral Higgs boson masses are roughly
stable against the variation of this phase.
