We consider a finite range lattice models on Cayley tree with two basic
properties: the existence of only a finite number of ground states and with
Peierls type condition. We define notion of a contour for the model on the
Cayley tree. By a contour argument we show the existence of $s$ different
(where $s$ is the number of ground states) Gibbs measures.
