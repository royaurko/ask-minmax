A classification and a detailed geometric description are given for smooth
$n$-dimensional subvarieties $X\subset{\mathbb P}^{2n-1}$ containing a family
of effective divisors each of them spanning a linear ${\mathbb P}^n$ of
${\mathbb P}^{2n-1}$. Some results on multisecant lines to threefolds
$X\subset{\mathbb P}^5$ follow, as a byproduct.
