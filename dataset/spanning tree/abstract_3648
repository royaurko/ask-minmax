These notes were given as lectures at the CERN Winter School on Supergravity,
Strings and Gauge Theory 2010. We describe the structure of scattering
amplitudes in gauge theories, focussing on the maximally supersymmetric theory
to highlight the hidden symmetries which appear. Using the BCFW recursion
relations we solve for the tree-level S-matrix in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory,
and describe how it produces a sum of invariants of a large symmetry algebra.
We review amplitudes in the planar theory beyond tree-level, describing the
connection between amplitudes and Wilson loops, and discuss the implications of
the hidden symmetries.
