In this article we discuss estimation of the common variance of several
normal populations with tree order restricted means. We discuss the asymptotic
properties of the maximum likelihood estimator of the variance as the number of
populations tends to infinity. We consider several cases of various orders of
the sample sizes and show that the maximum likelihood estimator of the variance
may or may not be consistent or be asymptotically normal.
