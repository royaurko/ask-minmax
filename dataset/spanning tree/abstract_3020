Tree structures are very often used data structures. Among ordered types of
trees there are many variants whose basic operations such as insert, delete,
search, delete-min are characterized by logarithmic time complexity. In the
article I am going to present the structure whose time complexity for each of
the above operations is $O(\frac{M}{K} + K)$, where M is the size of data type
and K is constant properly matching the size of data type. Properly matched K
will make the structure function as a very effective Priority Queue. The
structure size linearly depends on the number and size of elements. PTrie is a
clever combination of the idea of prefix tree -- Trie, structure of logarithmic
time complexity for insert and remove operations, doubly linked list and
queues.
