We concern the problem of modifying the edge lengths of a tree in minimum
total cost so that the prespecified $p$ vertices become the $p$-maxian with
respect to the new edge lengths. This problem is called the inverse $p$-maxian
problem on trees. \textbf{Gassner} proposed efficient combinatorial alogrithm
to solve the the inverse 1-maxian problem on trees in 2008. For the problem
with $p \geq 2$, we claim that the problem can be reduced to finitely many
inverse $2$-maxian problem. We then develop algorithms to solve the inverse
$2$-maxian problem for various objective functions. The problem under
$l_1$-norm can be formulated as a linear program and thus can be solved in
polynomial time. Particularly, if the underlying tree is a star, then the
problem can be solved in linear time. We also devised $O(n\log n)$ algorithms
to solve the problems under Chebyshev norm and bottleneck Hamming distance,
where $n$ is the number of vertices of the tree. Finally, the problem under
weighted sum Hamming distance is $NP$-hard.
