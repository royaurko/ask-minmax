We suggest that the canonical parallel operation of processes is composition
in a well-supported compact closed category of spans of reflexive graphs. We
present the parallel operations of classical process algebras as derived
operations arising from monoid objects in such a category, representing the
fact that they are protocols based on an underlying broadcast communication.
