There is a well-known correspondence between infinite trees and ultrametric
spaces which can be interpreted as an equivalence of categories and comes from
considering the end space of the tree.
  In this equivalence, uniformly continuous maps between the end spaces are
translated to some classes of coarse maps (or even classes of metrically proper
lipschitz maps) between the trees.
