Higher-order pushdown systems and ground tree rewriting systems can be seen
as extensions of suffix word rewriting systems. Both classes generate infinite
graphs with interesting logical properties. Indeed, the model-checking problem
for monadic second order logic (respectively first order logic with a
reachability predicate) is decidable on such graphs. We unify both models by
introducing the notion of stack trees, trees whose nodes are labelled by
higher-order stacks, and define the corresponding class of higher-order ground
tree rewriting systems. We show that these graphs retain the decidability
properties of ground tree rewriting graphs while generalising the pushdown
hierarchy of graphs.
