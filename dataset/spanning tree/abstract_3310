The problem of the vacuum energy decay is studied through the analysis of the
vacuum survival amplitude ${\mathcal A}(z, z')$. Transition amplitudes are
computed for finite time-span, $Z\equiv z^\prime-z$, and their {\em late time}
behavior is discussed up to first order in the coupling constant, $\l$.
