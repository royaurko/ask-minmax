In 2006, Suzuki, and Akbari & Alipour independently presented a necessary and
sufficient condition for edge-colored graphs to have a heterochromatic spanning
tree, where a heterochromatic spanning tree is a spanning tree whose edges have
distinct colors. In this paper, we propose $f$-chromatic graphs as a
generalization of heterochromatic graphs. An edge-colored graph is
$f$-chromatic if each color $c$ appears on at most $f(c)$ edges. We also
present a necessary and sufficient condition for edge-colored graphs to have an
$f$-chromatic spanning forest with exactly $m$ components. Moreover, using this
criterion, we show that a $g$-chromatic graph $G$ of order $n$ with
$|E(G)|>\binom{n-m}{2}$ has an $f$-chromatic spanning forest with exactly $m$
($1 \le m \le n-1$) components if $g(c) \le \frac{|E(G)|}{n-m}f(c)$ for any
color $c$.
