A depth-first search version of Dhar's burning algorithm is used to give a
bijection between the parking functions of a graph and labeled spanning trees,
relating the degree of the parking function with the number of inversions of
the spanning tree. Specializing to the complete graph answers a problem posed
by R. Stanley.
