We investigate the structure of connected graphs, not necessarily locally
finite, with infinitely many ends. On the one hand we study end-transitive such
graphs and on the other hand we study such graphs with the property that the
stabilizer of some end acts transitively on the vertices of the graph. In both
cases we show that the graphs have a tree-like structure.
