We present tests of comparison between our versions of the Fast Multipole
Algorithm (FMA) and ``classic'' tree-code to evaluate gravitational forces in
particle systems. We have optimized the Greengard's original version of FMA
allowing for a more efficient criterion of well-separation between boxes, to
improve the adaptivity of the method (which is very important in highly
inhomogeneous situations) and to permit the smoothing of gravitational
interactions. The results of our tests indicate that the tree-code is almost
three times faster than FMA for both a homogeneous and a clumped
distribution, at least in the interval of N (N< 10^5) here investigated and
at the same level of accuracy (error ~ 10^{-3)). This order of accuracy is
generally considered as the best compromise between CPU-time consumption and
precision for astrophysical simulation. Moreover, the claimed linear
dependence on N of the CPU-time of FMA is not confirmed and we give a
``theoretical'' explanation for that.
