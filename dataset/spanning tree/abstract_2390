The constant rate birth--death process is a popular null model for speciation
and extinction. If one removes extinct and non-sampled lineages, this process
induces `reconstructed trees' which describe the relationship between extant
lineages. We derive the probability density of the length of a randomly chosen
pendant edge in a reconstructed tree. For the special case of a pure-birth
process with complete sampling, we also provide the probability density of the
length of an interior edge, of the length of an edge descending from the root,
and of the diversity (which is the sum of all edge lengths). We show that the
results depend on whether the reconstructed trees are conditioned on the number
of leaves, the age, or both.
