The problem of stabilizing an unstable plant over a noisy communication link
is an increasingly important one that arises in problems of distributed control
and networked control systems. Although the work of Schulman and Sahai over the
past two decades, and their development of the notions of "tree codes" and
"anytime capacity", provides the theoretical framework for studying such
problems, there has been scant practical progress in this area because explicit
constructions of tree codes with efficient encoding and decoding did not exist.
To stabilize an unstable plant driven by bounded noise over a noisy channel one
needs real-time encoding and real-time decoding and a reliability which
increases exponentially with delay, which is what tree codes guarantee. We
prove the existence of linear tree codes with high probability and, for erasure
channels, give an explicit construction with an expected encoding and decoding
complexity that is constant per time instant. We give sufficient conditions on
the rate and reliability required of the tree codes to stabilize vector plants
and argue that they are asymptotically tight. This work takes a major step
towards controlling plants over noisy channels, and we demonstrate the efficacy
of the method through several examples.
