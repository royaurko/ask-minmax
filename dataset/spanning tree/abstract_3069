We consider the randomized decision tree complexity of the recursive
3-majority function. We prove a lower bound of $(1/2-\delta) \cdot 2.57143^h$
for the two-sided-error randomized decision tree complexity of evaluating
height $h$ formulae with error $\delta \in [0,1/2)$. This improves the lower
bound of $(1-2\delta)(7/3)^h$ given by Jayram, Kumar, and Sivakumar (STOC'03),
and the one of $(1-2\delta) \cdot 2.55^h$ given by Leonardos (ICALP'13).
Second, we improve the upper bound by giving a new zero-error randomized
decision tree algorithm that has complexity at most $(1.007) \cdot 2.64944^h$.
The previous best known algorithm achieved complexity $(1.004) \cdot
2.65622^h$. The new lower bound follows from a better analysis of the base case
of the recursion of Jayram et al. The new algorithm uses a novel "interleaving"
of two recursive algorithms.
