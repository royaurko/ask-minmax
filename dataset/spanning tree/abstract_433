We consider problems related to the combinatorial game (Free-)Flood-It, in
which players aim to make a coloured graph monochromatic with the minimum
possible number of flooding operations. We show that the minimum number of
moves required to flood any given graph G is equal to the minimum, taken over
all spanning trees T of G, of the number of moves required to flood T. This
result is then applied to give two polynomial-time algorithms for flood-filling
problems. Firstly, we can compute in polynomial time the minimum number of
moves required to flood a graph with only a polynomial number of connected
subgraphs. Secondly, given any coloured connected graph and a subset of the
vertices of bounded size, the number of moves required to connect this subset
can be computed in polynomial time.
