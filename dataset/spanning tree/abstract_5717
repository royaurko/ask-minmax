We compute the three-graviton tree amplitude in Type IIB superstring theory
compactified to six dimensions using the manifestly (6d) supersymmetric
Berkovits-Vafa-Witten worldsheet variables. We consider two cases of background
geometry: the flat space example R6xK3, and the curved example AdS3xS3xK3 with
Ramond flux, and compute the correlation functions in the bulk.
