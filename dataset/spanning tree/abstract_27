We give a Cayley type formula to count the number of spanning trees in the
complete r-uniform hypergraph for all r >= 3. Similar to the bijection between
spanning trees in complete graphs and Parking functions, we derive a bijection
from spanning trees of the complete (r+1)-uniform hypergraph which arise from a
fixed r-perfect matching and r-Parking functions. We observe a simple
consequence of this bijection in terms of the number of regions of the extended
Shi arrangement.
