We prove a refinement of the tree packing theorem by Tutte/Nash-Williams for
finite graphs. This result is used to obtain a similar result for end faithful
spanning tree packings in certain infinite graphs and consequently to establish
a sufficient Hamiltonicity condition for the line graphs of such graphs.
