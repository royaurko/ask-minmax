Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has been one of the most important
research areas in computer vision. It is a widely used method for searching
images in huge databases. In this paper we present a CBIR system called
NOHIS-Search. The system is based on the indexing technique NOHIS-tree. The two
phases of the system are described and the performance of the system is
illustrated with the image database ImagEval. NOHIS-Search system was compared
to other two CBIR systems; the first that using PDDP indexing algorithm and the
second system is that using the sequential search. Results show that
NOHIS-Search system outperforms the two other systems.
