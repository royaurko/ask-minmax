Searching learning or rules in relational database for data mining purposes
with characteristic or classification/discriminant rule in attribute oriented
induction technique can be quicker, easy, and simple with simple SQL statement.
With just only one simple SQL statement, characteristic and classification rule
can be created simultaneously. Collaboration SQL statement with any other
application software will increase the ability for creating t-weight as
measurement the typicality of each record in the characteristic rule and
d-weight as measurement the discriminating behavior of the learned
classification/discriminant rule, particularly for further generalization in
characteristic rule. Handling concept hierarchy into tables based on concept
tree will influence for the successful simple SQL statement and by knowing the
right standard knowledge to transform each of concept tree in concept hierarchy
into one table as transforming concept hierarchy into table, the simple SQL
statement can be run properly.
