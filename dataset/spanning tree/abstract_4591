Signs of hierarchy are prevalent in a wide range of systems in nature and
society. One of the key problems is quantifying the importance of hierarchical
organisation in the structure of the network representing the interactions or
connections between the fundamental units of the studied system. Although a
number of notable methods are already available, their vast majority is
treating all directed acyclic graphs as already maximally hierarchical. Here we
propose a hierarchy measure based on random walks on the network. The novelty
of our approach is that directed trees corresponding to multi level pyramidal
structures obtain higher hierarchy scores compared to directed chains and
directed stars. Furthermore, in the thermodynamic limit the hierarchy measure
of regular trees is converging to a well defined limit depending only on the
branching number. When applied to real networks, our method is computationally
very effective, as the result can be evaluated with arbitrary precision by
subsequent multiplications of the transition matrix describing the random walk
process. In addition, the tests on real world networks provided very intuitive
results, e.g., the trophic levels obtained from our approach on a food web were
highly consistent with former results from ecology.
