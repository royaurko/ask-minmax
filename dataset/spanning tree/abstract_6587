Segmentation-based image coding methods provide high compression ratios when
compared with traditional image coding approaches like the transform and sub
band coding for low bit-rate compression applications. In this paper, a
segmentation-based image coding method, namely the Binary Space Partition
scheme, that divides the desired image using a recursive procedure for coding
is presented. The BSP approach partitions the desired image recursively by
using bisecting lines, selected from a collection of discrete optional lines,
in a hierarchical manner. This partitioning procedure generates a binary tree,
which is referred to as the BSP-tree representation of the desired image. The
algorithm is extremely complex in computation and has high execution time. The
time complexity of the BSP scheme is explored in this work.
