We present an optical device which is capable of heralding a variety of DFS
states which protect against collective noise. Specifically, it can prepare all
three basis states which span a DFS qutrit as well as an arbitrarily encoded
DFS qubit state. We also discuss an interferometric technique for determining
the amplitudes associated with an arbitrary encoding. The heralded state may
find use in coherent optical systems which exhibit collective correlations.
