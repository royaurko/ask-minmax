We present a detailed study of the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic Ising model
on a Cayley tree. In the limit of zero field, the system displays glassy
behavior below a crossover temperature, $T_g$, that scales inversely with the
logarithm of the number of generations; thus $T_g$ is inversely proportional to
the logarithm of the logarithm of the number of sites. Non-Gaussian
magnetization distributions are observed for $T < T_g$, reminiscent of that
associated with the central spin of the Edwards-Anderson model on the same
tree; furthermore a dynamical study indicates metastability, long relaxation
times and ageing consistent with the development of glassy behavior for a
finite but macroscopic number of sites.
