In this work, we propose D3-Tree, a dynamic distributed deterministic
structure for data management in decentralized networks. We present in brief
the theoretical algorithmic analysis, in which our proposed structure is based
on, and we describe thoroughly the key aspects of the implementation.
Conducting experiments, we verify that the implemented structure outperforms
other well-known hierarchical tree-based structures, since it provides better
complexities regarding load-balancing operations. More specifically, the
structure achieves a logarithmic amortized bound, using an efficient
deterministic load-balancing mechanism, which is general enough to be applied
to other hierarchical tree-based structures. Moreover, we investigate the
structure's fault tolerance, which hasn't been sufficiently tackled in previous
work, both theoretically and through rigorous experimentation. We prove that
D3-Tree is highly fault tolerant, since, even for massive node failures, it
achieves a significant success rate in element queries. Afterwards we go one
step further, in order to achieve sub-logarithmic complexity and propose the
ART+ structure (Autonomous Range Tree), exploiting the excellent performance of
D3-Tree. ART+ is a fully dynamic and fault-tolerant structure, which achieves
sub-logarithmic performance for query and update operations and performs
load-balancing in sub-logarithmic amortized cost.
