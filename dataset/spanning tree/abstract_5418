For a random graph on n vertices where the edges appear with individual
rates, we give exact formulas for the expected time at which the number of
components has gone down to k and the expected length of the corresponding
minimal spanning forest.
  For a random bipartite graph we give a formula for the expected time at which
a k-assignment appears. This result has bearing upon the random assignment
problem.
