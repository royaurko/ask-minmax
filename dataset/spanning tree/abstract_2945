We consider the Wright-Fisher model for a population of $N$ individuals, each
identified with a sequence of a finite number of sites, and single-crossover
recombination between them. We trace back the ancestry of single individuals
from the present population. In the $N \to \infty$ limit without rescaling of
parameters or time, this ancestral process is described by a random tree, whose
branching events correspond to the splitting of the sequence due to
recombination. With the help of a decomposition of the trees into subtrees, we
calculate the probabilities of the topologies of the ancestral trees. At the
same time, these probabilities lead to a semi-explicit solution of the
deterministic single-crossover equation. The latter is a discrete-time
dynamical system that emerges from the Wright-Fisher model via a law of large
numbers and has been waiting for a solution for many decades.
