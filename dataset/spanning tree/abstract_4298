A general method to construct recombinant tree approximations for stochastic
volatility models is developed and applied to the Heston model for stock price
dynamics. In this application, the resulting approximation is a four tuple
Markov process. The first two components are related to the stock and
volatility processes and take values in a two-dimensional binomial tree. The
other two components of the Markov process are the increments of random walks
with simple values in $\{-1,+1\}$. The resulting efficient option pricing
equations are numerically implemented for general American and European options
including the standard put and calls, barrier, lookback and Asian-type
pay-offs. The weak and extended weak convergences are also proved.
