Sphere decoding (SD) is a low complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detection
algorithm, which has been adapted for different linear channels in digital
communications. The complexity of the SD has been shown to be exponential in
some cases, and polynomial in others and under certain assumptions. The sphere
radius and the number of nodes visited throughout the tree traversal search are
the decisive factors for the complexity of the algorithm. The radius problem
has been addressed and treated widely in the literature. In this paper, we
propose a new structure for SD, which drastically reduces the overall
complexity. The complexity is measured in terms of the floating point
operations per second (FLOPS) and the number of nodes visited throughout the
algorithm tree search. This reduction in the complexity is due to the ability
of decoding the real and imaginary parts of each jointly detected symbol
independently of each other, making use of the new lattice representation. We
further show by simulations that the new approach achieves 80% reduction in the
overall complexity compared to the conventional SD for a 2x2 system, and almost
50% reduction for the 4x4 and 6x6 cases, thus relaxing the requirements for
hardware implementation.
