We give a simple characterization of Lie elements in free pre-Lie algebras as
elements of the kernel of a map between spaces of trees. We explain how this
result is related to natural operations on the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of a
Lie algebra. We also indicate a possible relation to Loday's theory of
triplettes.
