In this paper we describe a new approach to implement the O(N) fast multipole
method and $O(N\log N)$ tree method, which uses pseudoparticles to express the
potential field. The new method is similar to Anderson's method, which uses the
values of potential at discrete points to represent the potential field.
However, for the same expansion order the new method is more accurate and
computationally efficient.
