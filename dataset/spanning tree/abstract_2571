We generate mode-locked picosecond pulses near 1110 nm by spectrally slicing
and reamplifying an octave-spanning supercontinuum source pumped at 1550 nm.
The 1110 nm pulses are near transform-limited, with 1.7 ps duration over their
1.2 nm bandwidth, and exhibit high interpulse coherence. Both the
supercontinuum source and the pulse synthesis system are implemented completely
in fiber. The versatile source construction suggests that pulse synthesis from
sliced supercontinuum may be a useful technique across the 1000 - 2000 nm
wavelength range.
