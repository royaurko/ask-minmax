We present a linear programming based algorithm for computing a spanning tree
$T$ of a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\Re^d$, such that its crossing number is
$O(\min(t \log n, n^{1-1/d}))$, where $t$ the minimum crossing number of any
spanning tree of $P$. This is the first guaranteed approximation algorithm for
this problem. We provide a similar approximation algorithm for the more general
settings of building a spanning tree for a set system with bounded \VC
dimension. Our approach is an alternative to the reweighting technique
previously used in computing such spanning trees.
