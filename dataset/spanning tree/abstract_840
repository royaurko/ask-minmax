We have developed (1) a graph visualization system that allows users to
explore graphs by viewing them as a succession of spanning trees selected
interactively, (2) a radial graph layout algorithm, and (3) an animation
algorithm that generates meaningful visualizations and smooth transitions
between graphs while minimizing edge crossings during transitions and in static
layouts.
  Our system is similar to the radial layout system of Yee et al. (2001), but
differs primarily in that each node is positioned on a coordinate system
centered on its own parent rather than on a single coordinate system for all
nodes. Our system is thus easy to define recursively and lends itself to
parallelization. It also guarantees that layouts have many nice properties,
such as: it guarantees certain edges never cross during an animation.
  We compared the layouts and transitions produced by our algorithms to those
produced by Yee et al. Results from several experiments indicate that our
system produces fewer edge crossings during transitions between graph drawings,
and that the transitions more often involve changes in local scaling rather
than structure.
  These findings suggest the system has promise as an interactive graph
exploration tool in a variety of settings.
