We exploit a bijection between plane recursive trees and Stirling
permutations; this yields the equivalence of some results previously proven
separately by different methods for the two types of objects as well as some
new results. We also prove results on the joint distribution of the numbers of
ascents, descents and plateaux in a random Stirling permutation. The proof uses
an interesting generalized Polya urn
