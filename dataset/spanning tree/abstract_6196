We present cross sections for the reactions p pbar --> H gamma and pp -->
H\gamma arising from the subprocess q qbar --> H gamma. The calculation
includes the complete one-loop contribution from all light quarks as well as
the tree contributions from light quarks and c and b quarks. These are the main
sources of Higgs-photon associated production at hadron colliders. At Tevatron
energies, the cross section is typically between 0.1fb and 1 fb for 80 Gev <
m_H < 160 GeV, and at LHC energies it exceeds about 2 fb over the same range of
m_H. While substantial, these cross sections are not large enough to produce a
signal which is discernable above the backgrounds from q qbar-->b bbar gamma
and gg-->b bbar gamma.
