We consider a nearest-neighbor four state hard-core (HC) model on the
homogeneous Cayley tree of order $k$. The Hamiltonian of the model is
considered on a set of "admissible" configurations. Admissibility is specified
through a graph with four vertices. We first exhibit conditions (on the graph
and on the parameters) under which the model has a unique Gibbs measure. Next
we turn on some specific cases. Namely, first we study, in case of particular
graph (diamond), translation-invariant and periodic Gibbs measures. We provide
in both cases the equations of the transition lines separating uniqueness from
non--uniqueness regimes. Finally the same is done for "fertile" graphs, the
so--called stick, gun, and key (here only translation invariant states are
taken into account).
