Fire is an indissoluble component of ecosystems, however quantifying the
effects of fire on vegetation is challenging task as fire lies outside the
typical experimental design attributes. A recent simulation study showed that
under increased fire regimes positive tree-tree interactions were recorded
(Bacelar et al., 2014). Data from experimental burning plots in an African
savanna, the Kruger National Park, were collected across unburnt and annual
burn plots. Indices of aggregation and spatial autocorrelation of the
distribution of trees between different fire regimes were explored. Results
show that the distribution of trees under fire were more clumped and exhibited
higher spatial autocorrelation than in unburnt plots: In burnt plots spatial
autocorrelation values were positive at finer scales and negative at coarser
scales potentially indicating co-existence of facilitation and competition
within the same ecosystem depending on the scale. The pattern derived here
provides inference for (a) fire acting as an increasing aggregation & spatial
autocorrelation force (b) tree survival under fire regimes is potentially
facilitated by forming patches of trees (c) scale-dependent facilitation and
competition coexisting within the same ecosystem with finer scale facilitation
and coarser scale competition.
