Physical mechanisms underlying the empirical correlation between relative
contact order (CO) and folding rate among naturally-occurring small
single-domain proteins are investigated by evaluating postulated interaction
schemes for a set of three-dimensional 27mer lattice protein models with 97
different CO values. Many-body interactions are constructed such that contact
energies become more favorable when short chain segments sequentially adjacent
to the contacting residues adopt native-like conformations. At a given
interaction strength, this scheme leads to folding rates that are
logarithmically well correlated with CO (correlation coefficient $r=0.914$) and
span more than 2.5 orders of magnitude, whereas folding rates of the
corresponding G\=o models with additive contact energies have much less
logarithmic correlation with CO and span only approximately one order of
magnitude. The present protein chain models also exhibit calorimetric
cooperativity and linear chevron plots similar to that observed experimentally
for proteins with apparent simple two-state folding/unfolding kinetics. Thus,
our findings suggest that CO-dependent folding rates of real proteins may arise
partly from a significant positive coupling between nonlocal contact
favorabilities and local conformational preferences.
