Bounded infinite graphs are defined on the basis of natural physical
requirements. When specialized to trees this definition leads to a natural
conjecture that the average connectivity dimension of bounded trees cannot
exceed two. We verify that this bound is saturated by a class of random trees,
in which case we derive also explicit expressions for the growth probabilities.
