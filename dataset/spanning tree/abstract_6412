The 3D tree visualization faces multiple challenges: the election of an
appropriate layout, the use of the interactions that make the data exploration
easier and a metaphor that helps in the process of information understanding. A
good combination of these elements will result in a visualization that
effectively conveys the key features of a complex structure or system to a wide
range of users and permits the analytical reasoning process. In previous works
we presented the Spherical Layout, a technique for 3D tree visualization that
provides an excellent base to achieve those key features. The layout was
implemented using the TriSphere algorithm, a method that discretized the
spheres's surfaces with triangles to achieve a uniform distribution of the
nodes. The goal of this work was centered in a new algorithm for the
implementation of the Spherical layout; we called it the Weighted Spherical
Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (WSCVT). In this paper we present a detailed
description of this new implementation and a comparison with the TriSphere
algorithm.
