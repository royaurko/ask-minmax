A maximal minor $M$ of the Laplacian of an $n$-vertex Eulerian digraph
$\Gamma$ gives rise to a finite group $\mathbb{Z}^{n-1}/\mathbb{Z}^{n-1}M$
known as the sandpile (or critical) group $S(\Gamma)$ of $\Gamma$. We determine
$S(\Gamma)$ of the generalized de Bruijn graphs $\Gamma=\mathrm{DB}(n,d)$ with
vertices $0,\dots,n-1$ and arcs $(i,di+k)$ for $0\leq i\leq n-1$ and $0\leq
k\leq d-1$, and closely related generalized Kautz graphs, extending and
completing earlier results for the classical de Bruijn and Kautz graphs.
  Moreover, for a prime $p$ and an $n$-cycle permutation matrix
$X\in\mathrm{GL}_n(p)$ we show that $S(\mathrm{DB}(n,p))$ is isomorphic to the
quotient by $\langle X\rangle$ of the centralizer of $X$ in
$\mathrm{PGL}_n(p)$. This offers an explanation for the coincidence of
numerical data in sequences A027362 and A003473 of the OEIS, and allows one to
speculate upon a possibility to construct normal bases in the finite field
$\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ from spanning trees in $\mathrm{DB}(n,p)$.
