We give a computationally efficient method for constructing the linear
differential operator with polynomial coefficients whose space of holomorphic
solutions is spanned by all the branches of a function defined by a generic
algebraic curve. The proposed method does not require solving the algebraic
equation and can be applied in the case when its Galois group is not solvable.
