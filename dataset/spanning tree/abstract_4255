We design exact polynomial expansions of a class of Feynman--Kac particle
distributions. These expansions are finite and are parametrized by coalescent
trees and other related combinatorial quantities. The accuracy of the
expansions at any order is related naturally to the number of coalescences of
the trees. Our results include an extension of the Wick product formula to
interacting particle systems. They also provide refined nonasymptotic
propagation of chaos-type properties, as well as sharp $\mathbb{L}_p$-mean
error bounds, and laws of large numbers for $U$-statistics.
