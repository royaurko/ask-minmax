We establish a representation of a class of solutions of 3d Navier-Stokes
equations in $\R^3$ using sums over rooted trees. We study the convergence
properties of this series recovering in a simplified manner some results
obtained recently by Sinai and other known results for solutions in spaces of
pseudo-measures introduced initially by Le Jan and Sznitman. The series
representation make sense also in the critical case where there exists global
solutions for small initial data and it allows the study of their long-time or
small-distance behavior.
