We prove the following theorem: Let $\pi$ be the fundamental group of a
finite graph of groups with finitely generated vertex groups $G_v$ having asdim
$G_v\le n$ for all vertices $v$. Then asdim$\pi\le n+1$.
  This gives the best possible estimate for the asymptotic dimension of an HNN
extension and the amalgamated product.
