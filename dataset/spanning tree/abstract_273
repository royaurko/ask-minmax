Searching in P2P networks is fundamental to all overlay networks.
  P2P networks based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are optimized for single
key lookups, whereas unstructured networks offer more complex queries at the
cost of increased traffic and uncertain success rates. Our Distributed Tree
Construction (DTC) approach enables structured P2P networks to perform prefix
search, range queries, and multicast in an optimal way. It achieves this by
creating a spanning tree over the peers in the search area, using only
information available locally on each peer. Because DTC creates a spanning
tree, it can query all the peers in the search area with a minimal number of
messages. Furthermore, we show that the tree depth has the same upper bound as
a regular DHT lookup which in turn guarantees fast and responsive runtime
behavior. By placing objects with a region quadtree, we can perform a prefix
search or a range query in a freely selectable area of the DHT. Our DTC
algorithm is DHT-agnostic and works with most existing DHTs. We evaluate the
performance of DTC over several DHTs by comparing the performance to existing
application-level multicast solutions, we show that DTC sends 30-250% fewer
messages than common solutions.
