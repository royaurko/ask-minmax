The most popular algorithms for generation of minimal spanning tree are
Kruskal and Prim algorithm. Many algorithms have been proposed for generation
of all spanning tree. This paper deals with generation of all possible spanning
trees in increasing cost of a weighted graph. This approach uses one matrix
called Difference Weighted Circuit Matrix; it is little bit modification of
FCM.
