We study periodic wind-tree models, unbounded planar billiards with
periodically located rectangular obstacles. For a class of rational parameters
we show the existence of completely periodic directions, and recurrence; for
another class of rational parameters, there are directions in which all
trajectories escape, and we prove a rate of escape for almost all directions.
These results extend to a dense $G_\delta$ of parameters.
