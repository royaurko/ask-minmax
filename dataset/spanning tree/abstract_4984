Most stars in our Galaxy with photospheric C/O>1 (carbon stars) are not
giants but dwarfs. The newly-recognized class of dwarf carbon (dC) stars joins
the growing family of stars with peculiar abundances that are now recognized as
products of mass-transfer binary (MTB) evolution. The dozen examples now known
span a wide range of evolutionary histories, ages, and abundances. These stars
can already provide some much-needed constraints on the formation of AGB C
stars in the disk and spheroid populations, and on the parameters
characterizing binary evolution there. A larger sample of dCs, with some bright
members, would hasten our progress.
