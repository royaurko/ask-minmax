We address the fact that composition in an opetopic weak n-category is in
general not unique and hence is not a well-defined operation. We define
composition with a given k-cell in an n-category by a span of (n-k)-categories.
We characterise such a cell as universal if its composition span gives an
equivalence of (n-k)-categories.
