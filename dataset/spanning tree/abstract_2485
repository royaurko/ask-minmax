A new experimental analysis of $B\to K\pi$ decays provides finite
experimental values for the contributions from interference terms between the
dominant penguin amplitude and the color-favored and color-suppressed tree
amplitudes. These results can explain the puzzling failure to see CP violation
in $B^\pm\to K\pi$ decays. Tree-penguin interference contributions are commonly
believed to be the source of the observed direct CP violation in $B^o\to
K^\pm\pi^\mp$ decays. The data show that the color-favored and color-suppressed
tree contributions interfere destructively in $B^\pm\to K^\pm\pi^o$ decays and
nearly cancel. This suprising cancellation is not predicted by present theory.
There is also no prediction for any difference produced by changing the flavor
of the spectator quark. Isospin and Pauli effects that change with spectator
quark flavor are examined and show using group theory and the color-spun SU(6)
algebra how they produce both the near cancellation and the dependence on
spectator quark flavor. The standard $B\to K\pi$ analysis which treats
tree-penguin interference only in first order has three parameters
overdetermined by four experimental branching ratios. Previous analyses
confirmed the model but with large errors leaving the values of tree-penguin
interference contributions less that two standard deviations from zero. The new
analysis finds interference contributions well above the errors.
