We give a new, manifestly spacetime-supersymmetric method for calculating
superstring scattering amplitudes, using the ghost pyramid, that is simpler
than all other known methods. No pictures nor non-vertex insertions are
required other than the usual b and c ghosts of the bosonic string. We evaluate
some tree and loop amplitudes as examples.
