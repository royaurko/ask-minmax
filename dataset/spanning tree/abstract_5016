Sloan Digital Sky Survey data for the field of the globular cluster Pal 5
reveal the existence of a long massive stream of tidal debris spanning an arc
of 10 degrees on the sky. Pal 5 thus provides an outstanding example for tidal
disruption of globular clusters in the Milky Way. Radial velocities from VLT
spectra show that Pal 5 has an extremely low velocity dispersion, in accordance
with the very low mass derived from its total luminosity.
