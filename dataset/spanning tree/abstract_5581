Using black hole masses which span 10^5 to 10^(10) solar masses, the
distribution of galaxies in the (host spheroid stellar mass)-(black hole mass)
diagram is shown to be strongly bent. While the core-Sersic galaxies follow a
near-linear relation, having a mean M_(bh)/M_(sph) mass ratio of ~0.5%, the
Sersic galaxies follow a near-quadratic relation: M_bh~M_sph^(2.22+\-0.58).
This is not due to offset pseudobulges, but is instead an expected result
arising from the long-known bend in the M_(sph)-sigma relation and the
log-linear M_(bh)-sigma relation.
