Considering the most general one-species reaction-diffusion processes on a
Cayley tree, it has been shown that there exist two integrable models. In the
first model, the reactions are the various creation processes, i.e.
$\circ\circ\to\bullet\circ$, $\circ\circ\to\bullet\bullet$ and
$\circ\bullet\to\bullet\bullet$, and in the second model, only the diffusion
process $\bullet\circ\to\circ\bullet$ exists. For the first model, the
probabilities $P_l(m;t)$, of finding $m$ particles on $l$-th shell of Cayley
tree, have been found exactly, and for the second model, the functions
$P_l(1;t)$ have been calculated. It has been shown that these are the only
integrable models, if one restricts himself to $L+1$-shell probabilities
$P(m_0,m_1,...,m_L;t)$s.
