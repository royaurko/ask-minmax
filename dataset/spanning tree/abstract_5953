A planar map is outerplanar if all its vertices belong to the same face. We
show that random uniform outerplanar maps with $n$ vertices suitably rescaled
by a factor $1/ \sqrt{n}$ converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to
$\displaystyle{\frac{7 \sqrt{2}}{9}}$ times Aldous' Brownian tree. The proof
uses the bijection of Bonichon, Gavoille and Hanusse.
