Transformational musical theory has so far mainly focused on the study of
groups acting on musical chords, one of the most famous example being the
action of the dihedral group D24 on the set of major and minor chords.
Comparatively less work has been devoted to the study of transformations of
time-spans and rhythms. D. Lewin was the first to study group actions on
time-spans by using a subgroup of the affine group in one dimension. In our
previous work, the work of Lewin has been included in the more general
framework of group extensions, and generalizations to time-spans on multiple
timelines have been proposed. The goal of this paper is to show that such
generalizations have a categorical background in free monoidal categories
generated by a group-as-category. In particular, symmetric monoidal categories
allow to deal with the possible interexchanges between timelines. We also show
that more general time-spans can be considered, in which single time-spans are
encapsulated in a "bracket" of time-spans, which allows for the description of
complex rhythms.
