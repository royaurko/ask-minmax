In this paper, the 3-user multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian
interference channel with M antennas at each transmitter and N antennas at each
receiver is considered. It is assumed that the channel coefficients are
constant and known to all transmitters and receivers. A novel scheme is
presented that spans a new achievable degrees of freedom region. For some
values of M and N, the proposed scheme achieve higher number of DoF than are
currently achievable, while for other values it meets the best known
upperbound. Simulation results are presented showing the superior performance
of the proposed schemes to earlier approaches.
