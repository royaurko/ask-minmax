In order to conduct a statistical analysis on a given set of phylogenetic
gene trees, we often use a distance measure between two trees. In a statistical
distance-based method to analyze discordance between gene trees, it is a key to
decide "biological meaningful" and "statistically well-distributed" distance
between trees. Thus, in this paper, we study the distributions of the three
tree distance metrics: the edge difference, the path difference, and the
precise $K$ interval cospeciation distance, between two trees: first, we focus
on distributions of the three tree distances between two random unrooted trees
with $n$ leaves ($n \geq 4$); and then we focus on the distributions the three
tree distances between a fixed rooted species tree with $n$ leaves and a random
gene tree with $n$ leaves generated under the coalescent process with given the
species tree. We show some theoretical results as well as simulation study on
these distributions.
