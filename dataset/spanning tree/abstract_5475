We give an introductory account of Khovanov's categorification of the
Heisenberg algebra, and construct a combinatorial model for it in a 2-category
of spans of groupoids. We also treat a categorification of $U(sl_n)$ in a
similar way. These give rise to standard representations on vector spaces
through a linearization process.
