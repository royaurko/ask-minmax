We perform a comparison of the performance and efficiency of four different
function evaluation methods: black-box functions, binary trees, $n$-ary trees
and string parsing. The test consists in evaluating 8 different functions of
two variables $x,y$ over 5000 floating point values of the pair $(x,y)$. The
outcome of the test indicates that the $n$-ary tree representation of algebraic
expressions is the fastest method, closely followed by black-box function
method, then by binary trees and lastly by string parsing.
