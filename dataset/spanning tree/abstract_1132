We investigate a new width parameter, the fusion-width of a graph. It is a
natural generalization of the tree-width, yet strong enough that not only
graphs of bounded tree-width, but also graphs of bounded clique-width,
trivially have bounded fusion-width. In particular, there is no exponential
growth between tree-width and fusion-width, as is the case between tree-width
and clique-width. The new parameter gives a good intuition about the
relationship between tree-width and clique-width.
