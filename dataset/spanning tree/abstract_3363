In the paper portfolio optimization over long run risk sensitive criterion is
considered. It is assumed that economic factors which stimulate asset prices
are ergodic but non necessarily uniformly ergodic. Solution to suitable Bellman
equation using local span contraction with weighted norms is shown. The form of
optimal strategy is presented and examples of market models satisfying imposed
assumptions are shown.
