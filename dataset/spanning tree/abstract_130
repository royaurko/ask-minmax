We have studied the Steiner tree problem using six-pin soap films in detail.
We extend the existing method of experimental realisation of Steiner trees in
$n$-terminal problem through soap films to observe new non-minimal Steiner
trees. We also produced spanning tree configurations for the first time by our
method. Experimentally, by varying the pin diameter, we have achieved these new
stable soap film configurations. A new algorithm is presented for creating
these Steiner trees theoretically.
  Exact lengths of these Steiner tree configurations are calculated using a
geometrical method. An exact two-parameter empirical formula is proposed for
estimating the lengths of these soap film configurations in six-pin soap film
problem.
