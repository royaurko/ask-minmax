Identifiability of evolutionary tree models has been a recent topic of
discussion and some models have been shown to be non-identifiable. A
coalescent-based rooted population tree model, originally proposed by Nielsen
et al. 1998 [2], has been used by many contributors in the last few years and is a
simple tool to accurately model the changes in allele frequencies in the tree.
However, the identifiability of this model has never been proven. Here we prove
this model to be identifiable by showing that the model parameters can be
expressed as functions of the probability distributions of subsamples. This a
step toward proving the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator of the
population tree based on this model.
