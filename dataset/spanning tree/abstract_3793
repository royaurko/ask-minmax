In this article a collection of random self-similar fractal dendrites is
constructed, and their Hausdorff dimension is calculated. Previous results
determining this quantity for random self-similar structures have relied on
geometrical properties of an underlying metric space or the scaling factors
being bounded uniformly away from 0. However, using a percolative argument, and
taking advantage of the tree-like structure of the sets considered here, it is
shown that conditions such as these are not necessary. The scaling factors of
the recursively defined structures in consideration form what is known as a
multiplicative cascade, and results about the height of this random object are
also obtained.
