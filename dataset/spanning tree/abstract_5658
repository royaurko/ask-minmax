Recently, Angheben et.al. [hep-th/0503081] have presented a refined method
for calculating the (tree-level) black hole temperature by way of the tunneling
paradigm. In the current letter, we demonstrate how their formalism can be
suitably adapted to accommodate the (higher-order) effects of the gravitational
back-reaction.
