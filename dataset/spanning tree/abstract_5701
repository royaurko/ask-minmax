String backgrounds are described as purely geometric objects related to
moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, in the spirit of Segal's definition of a
conformal field theory. Relations with conformal field theory, topological
field theory and topological gravity are studied. For each field theory, an
algebraic counterpart, the (homotopy) algebra satisfied by the tree level
correlators, is constructed.
