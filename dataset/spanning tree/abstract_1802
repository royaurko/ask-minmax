We divide the class of infinite computable trees into three types. For the
first and second types, $0'$ computes a nontrivial self-embedding while for the
third type $0''$ computes a nontrivial self-embedding. These results are
optimal and we obtain partial results concerning the complexity of nontrivial
self-embeddings of infinite computable trees considered up to isomorphism. We
show that every infinite computable tree must have either an infinite
computable chain or an infinite $\Pi^0_1$ antichain. This result is optimal and
has connections to the program of reverse mathematics.
