We provide a complete description of possible correlation matrices consistent
with a Gaussian latent tree model for any tree. This is expressed in the form
of algebraic and semi-algebraic constraints imposed on the correlation matrix.
We present techniques for utilising these constraints to assess whether
observed data is compatible with a Gaussian latent tree model. We demonstrate
the usefulness of the inverse-Wishart distribution to perform preliminary
assessments of tree compatibility using the semi-algebraic constraints.
Further, we note the correspondence of these algebraic constraints with
vanishing tetrads. Using Drton et al. (2008) we provide the appropriate moments
required for test statistics for assessing adherence to these equality
constraints. We illustrate our exploratory tetrad analysis using a linguistic
application and our confirmatory tetrad analysis using a biological
application.
