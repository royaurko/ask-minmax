We prove that the squared partition function of the two-dimensional critical
Ising model defined on a finite, isoradial graph $G=(V,E)$, is equal to
$2^{|V|}$ times the partition function of spanning trees of the graph
$\bar{G}$, where $\bar{G}$ is the graph $G$ extended along the boundary; edges
of $G$ are assigned Kenyon's [Ken02] critical weights, and boundary edges of
$\bar{G}$ have specific weights. The proof is an explicit construction,
providing a new relation on the level of configurations between two classical,
critical models of statistical mechanics.
