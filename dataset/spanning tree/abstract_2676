Recently Byrka, Grandoni, Rothvoss and Sanita (at STOC 2010) gave a
1.39-approximation for the Steiner tree problem, using a hypergraph-based
linear programming relaxation. They also upper-bounded its integrality gap by
1.55. We describe a shorter proof of the same integrality gap bound, by
applying some of their techniques to a randomized loss-contracting algorithm.
