We investigate the structure of the moduli space of multiple BPS non-Abelian
vortices in U(N) gauge theory with N fundamental Higgs fields, focusing our
attention on the action of the exact global (color-flavor diagonal) SU(N)
symmetry on it. The moduli space of a single non-Abelian vortex, CP(N-1), is
spanned by a vector in the fundamental representation of the global SU(N)
symmetry. The moduli space of winding-number k vortices is instead spanned by
vectors in the direct-product representation: they decompose into the sum of
irreducible representations each of which is associated with a Young tableau
made of k boxes, in a way somewhat similar to the standard group composition
rule of SU(N) multiplets. The K\"ahler potential is exactly determined in each
moduli subspace, corresponding to an irreducible SU(N) orbit of the
highest-weight configuration.
