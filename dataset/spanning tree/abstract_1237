In 1997 Klav\v{z}ar and Gutman suggested a generalization of the Wiener index
to vertex-weighted graphs. We minimize the Wiener index over the set of trees
with the given vertex weights' and degrees' sequences and show an optimal tree
to be the, so-called, Huffman tree built in a bottom-up manner by sequentially
connecting vertices of the least weights.
