We provide information about the asymptotic regimes for a homogeneous
fragmentation of a finite set. We establish a phase transition for the
asymptotic behaviours of the shattering times, defined as the first instants
when all the blocks of the partition process have cardinality less than a fixed
integer. Our results may be applied to the study of certain random split trees.
