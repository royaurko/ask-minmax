In this paper it is argued that the properties of the fixed point action of a
renormalization group transformation can be used to implement the on-shell
tree-level Symanzik improvement of lattice actions to any given order in the
expansion in the lattice spacing, in a way which does not involve any
perturbative calculations. In particular, a well-known technique for the lowest
order improvement of SU(N) lattice gauge theories is revisited from the point
of view of fixed point actions, which allows to shed light on some subtle
points.
