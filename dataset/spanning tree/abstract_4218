The colour-suppressed tree amplitude in non-leptonic B decays is particularly
sensitive to perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. We calculate the
two-loop (NNLO) vertex corrections to the colour-suppressed and colour-allowed
tree amplitudes in QCD factorization. Our results are given completely
analytically, including the full dependence on the charm quark mass. We then
update theoretical predictions for a range of interesting observables derived
from pi pi, pi rho, and rho rho final states that do not depend (significantly)
on penguin contributions, and hence are now available with NNLO accuracy. We
observe good agreement with experimental data within experimental and
theoretical errors, except for observables involving the pi^0 pi^0 branching
fraction.
