In this paper, we introduce a set of tools for providing user-friendly
explanations in an explanation-based constraint programming system. The idea is
to represent the constraints of a problem as an hierarchy (a tree). Users are
then represented as a set of understandable nodes in that tree (a cut).
Classical explanations (sets of system constraints) just need to get projected
on that representation in order to be understandable by any user. We present
here the main interests of this idea.
