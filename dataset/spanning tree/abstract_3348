We produce an edge-coloring of the complete 3-uniform hypergraph on n
vertices with $e^{O(\sqrt {log log n})}$ colors such that the edges spanned by
every set of five vertices receive at least three distinct colors. This answers
the first open case of a question of Conlon-Fox-Lee-Sudakov [1] who asked
whether such a coloring exists with $(log n)^{o(1)}$ colors.
