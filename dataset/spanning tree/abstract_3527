We design a theoretic tree-based functional representation of a class of
Feynman-Kac particle distributions, including an extension of the Wick product
formula to interacting particle systems. These weak expansions rely on an
original combinatorial, and permutation group analysis of a special class of
forests. They provide refined non asymptotic propagation of chaos type
properties, as well as sharp $\LL\_p$-mean error bounds, and laws of large
numbers for $U$-statistics. Applications to particle interpretations of the top
eigenvalues, and the ground states of Schr\"{o}dinger semigroups are also
discussed.
