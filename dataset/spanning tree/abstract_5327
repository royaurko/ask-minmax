Recently the structure of disordered gold-polymer(PMMA-Au) thin films have
been measured using Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). We have analyzed these
experimental results using the fractal SAXS theory. The films are formed of
polymer-embedded gold nanoclusters and were fabricated by very low energy gold
ion implantation into PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate). The composite films span
(with dose variation) the transition from electrically insulating to
electrically conducting regimes, a range of interest fundamentally and
technologically. We find excellent agreement with theory, and show that the
PMMA-Au films have monodispersive or polydispersive characteristics depending
on the implanted ion dose. Keywords: SAXS theory, Fractality, percolation,
correlation effects.
