We study a simple two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) in the Randall-Sundrum
scenario, with an IR brane localized Higgs field and a second doublet arising
from a $t\bar{t}$ condensate due to strong Kaluza-Klein gluon effects.
  The effective 2HDM predicts that the ratio of the brane to condensate vacuum
expectation values $\tan \beta \sim 3$. It also predicts a standard model like
Higgs boson of mass ${\mathcal{O}}(100)$ GeV and a heavier scalar at the scale
of the lowest KK gluon mass, which we take to be $M_{KK} \gtrsim 1.5$ TeV. The
pseudoscalar and the charged scalars are degenerate in mass at tree-level and
are ${\mathcal{O}}(M_{KK})$. There are no tree-level flavor changing neutral
currents (FCNC) for the down-type quarks and the standard model results hold
there. In contrast, FCNC decays of the t-quark larger than in the SM are
expected.
