Two trees in the boundary of outer space are said to be
\emph{primitive-equivalent} whenever their translation length functions are
equal in restriction to the set of primitive elements of $F_N$. We give an
explicit description of this equivalence relation, showing in particular that
it is nontrivial. This question is motivated by our description of the
horoboundary of outer space for the Lipschitz metric. Along the proof, we
extend a theorem due to White about the Lipschitz metric on outer space to
trees in the boundary, showing that the infimal Lipschitz constant of an
$F_N$-equivariant map between the metric completion of any two minimal, very
small $F_N$-trees is equal to the supremal ratio between the translation
lengths of the elements of $F_N$ in these trees. We also provide approximation
results for trees in the boundary of outer space.
