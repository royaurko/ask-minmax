We present an innovative technique which allows the simultaneous measurement
of the dielectric constant of a material at many frequencies, spanning a four
orders of magnitude range chosen between 10 --2 Hz and 10 4 Hz. The sensitivity
and accuracy are comparable to those obtained using standard single frequency
techniques. The technique is based on three new and simple features: a) the
precise real time correction of the amplication of a current amplier; b) the
specic shape of the excitation signal and its frequency spectrum; and c) the
precise synchronization between the generation of the excitation signal and the
acquisition of the dielectric response signal. This technique is useful in the
case of relatively fast dynamical measurements when the knowledge of the time
evolution of the dielectric constant is needed.
