In Randall-Sundrum models with gauge bosons and fermions in the extra
dimensional bulk, it is possible to build models of flavor by localizing the
fermions in the extra dimension. Since the Higgs must be localized at or close
to the TeV scale fixed point, heavier fermions must be localized close to this
brane. The first Kaluza-Klein excitations of the gauge bosons are also
TeV-localized, so they have stronger couplings to heavier fermions leading to
tree-level flavor-violating couplings. We investigate the potential of the LHC
to observe flavor violation in single top production at very high invariant
masses, in addition to the observation of the corresponding top--anti-top
resonance. We conclude that the LHC will be able to observe tree-level flavor
violation in single top production, probing KK masses at least as large as 2
TeV, as well as a very interesting region of the parameters.
