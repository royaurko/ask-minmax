The minimum spanning tree, based on the concept of ultrametricity, is
constructed from the correlation matrix of stock returns and provides a
meaningful economic taxonomy of the stock market. In order to study the
dynamics of this asset tree we characterize it by its normalized length and by
the mean occupation layer, as measured from an appropriately chosen center. We
show how the tree evolves over time, and how it shrinks particularly strongly
during a stock market crisis. We then demonstrate that the assets of the
optimal Markowitz portfolio lie practically at all times on the outskirts of
the tree. We also show that the normalized tree length and the investment
diversification potential are very strongly correlated.
