We present a numerical method to generate explicit realizations of the tree
of states in mean-field spin glasses. The resulting study illuminates the
physical meaning of the full replica symmetry breaking solution and provides
detailed information on the structure of the spin-glass phase. A cavity
approach ensures that the method is self-consistent and permits the evaluation
of sophisticated observables, such as correlation functions. We include an
example application to the study of finite-size effects in single-sample
overlap probability distributions, a topic that has attracted considerable
interest recently.
