We show that the weight functional for color sources in the classical theory
of the Color Glass Condensate includes a term which generates Odderon
excitations. Remarkably, the classical origin of these excitations can be
traced to the random walk of partons in the two dimensional space spanned by
the SU(3) Casimirs. This term is naturally suppressed for a large nucleus at
high energies.
