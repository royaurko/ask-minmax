We study a family of mutually commutative difference operators associated
with the affine root systems. These operators act on the space of meromorphic
functions on the Cartan subalgebra of the affine Lie algebra. We show that the
space spanned by the characters of a fixed positive level is invariant under
the action of these operators.
