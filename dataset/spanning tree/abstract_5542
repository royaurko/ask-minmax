We show that the ultrashort cavity soliton in octave-spanning Kerr frequency
comb generation exhibits striking self-adaptiveness and robustness to external
perturbations, resulting in a novel frequency shifting/cancellation mechanism
and gigantic dispersive wave generation in response to the strong frequency
dependence of Kerr nonlinearity, Raman scattering, chromatic dispersion, and
cavity Q. These observations open up a great avenue towards versatile
manipulation of nonlinear soliton dynamics, flexible spectrum engineering of
mode-locked Kerr frequency combs, and highly efficient frequency translation of
optical waves.
