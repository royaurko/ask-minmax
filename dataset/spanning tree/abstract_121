We describe a canonical spanning tree of the ridge graph of a subword complex
on a finite Coxeter group. It is based on properties of greedy facets in
subword complexes, defined and studied in this paper. Searching this tree
yields an enumeration scheme for the facets of the subword complex. This
algorithm extends the greedy flip algorithm for pointed pseudotriangulations of
points or convex bodies in the plane.
