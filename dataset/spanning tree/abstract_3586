We propose a novel numerical method for solving a quadratic vector equation
arising in Markovian Binary Trees. The numerical method consists in a fixed
point iteration, expressed by means of the Perron vectors of a sequence of
nonnegative matrices. A theoretical convergence analysis is performed. The
proposed method outperforms the existing methods for close-to-critical
problems.
