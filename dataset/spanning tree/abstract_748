We prove empirical central limit theorems for the distribution of levels of
various random fields defined on high-dimensional discrete structures as the
dimension of the structure goes to $\infty$. The random fields considered
include costs of assignments, weights of Hamiltonian cycles and spanning trees,
energies of directed polymers, locations of particles in the branching random
walk, as well as energies in the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick and Edwards--Anderson
models. The distribution of levels in all models listed above is shown to be
essentially the same as in a stationary Gaussian process with regularly varying
nonsummable covariance function. This type of behavior is different from the
Brownian bridge-type limit known for independent or stationary weakly dependent
sequences of random variables.
