We establish a number of extensions of the well-poised Bailey lemma and
elliptic well-poised Bailey lemma. As application we prove some new
transformation formulae for basic and elliptic hypergeometric series, and embed
some recent identities of Andrews, Berkovich and Spiridonov in a well-poised
Bailey tree.
