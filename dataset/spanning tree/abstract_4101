It is well-known that freeness and linearity information positively interact
with aliasing information, allowing both the precision and the efficiency of
the sharing analysis of logic programs to be improved. In this paper we present
a novel combination of set-sharing with freeness and linearity information,
which is characterized by an improved abstract unification operator. We provide
a new abstraction function and prove the correctness of the analysis for both
the finite tree and the rational tree cases. Moreover, we show that the same
notion of redundant information as identified in (Bagnara et al. 2002;
Zaffanella et al. 2002) also applies to this abstract domain combination: this
allows for the implementation of an abstract unification operator running in
polynomial time and achieving the same precision on all the considered
observable properties.
