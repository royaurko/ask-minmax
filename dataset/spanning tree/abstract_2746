Rooted trees with probabilities are used to analyze properties of a variable
length code. A bound is derived on the difference between the entropy rates of
the code and a memoryless source. The bound is in terms of normalized
informational divergence. The bound is used to derive converses for exact
random number generation, resolution coding, and distribution matching.
