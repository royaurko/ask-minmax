During the last decade, self-affine geometrical properties of many growing
aggregates, originated in a wide variety of processes, have been well
characterized. However, little progress has been achieved in the search of a
unified description of the underlying dynamics. Extensive numerical evidence
has been given showing that the bulk of aggregates formed upon ballistic
aggregation and random deposition with surface relaxation processes can be
broken down into a set of infinite scale invariant structures called "trees".
These two types of aggregates have been selected because it has been
established that they belong to different universality classes: those of
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and Edward-Wilkinson, respectively. Exponents describing
the spatial and temporal scale invariance of the trees can be related to the
classical exponents describing the self-affine nature of the growing interface.
Furthermore, those exponents allows us to distinguish either the compact or
non-compact nature of the growing trees. Therefore, the measurement of the
statistic of the process of growing trees may become a useful experimental
technique for the evaluation of the self-affine properties of some aggregates.
