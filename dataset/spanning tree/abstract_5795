This paper deals with the existence of solutions to a class of fourth order
nonlinear elliptic equations. The technique used relies on critical points
theory. The solutions appeared as critical points of a functional restricted to
a suitable manifold.In the case of constant coefficients we obtain the
existence of tree distinct solutions.
