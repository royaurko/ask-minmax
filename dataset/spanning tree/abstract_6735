We consider the problem of learning a non-deterministic probabilistic system
consistent with a given finite set of positive and negative tree samples.
Consistency is defined with respect to strong simulation conformance. We
propose learning algorithms that use traditional and a new "stochastic"
state-space partitioning, the latter resulting in the minimum number of states.
We then use them to solve the problem of "active learning", that uses a
knowledgeable teacher to generate samples as counterexamples to simulation
equivalence queries. We show that the problem is undecidable in general, but
that it becomes decidable under a suitable condition on the teacher which comes
naturally from the way samples are generated from failed simulation checks. The
latter problem is shown to be undecidable if we impose an additional condition
on the learner to always conjecture a "minimum state" hypothesis. We therefore
propose a semi-algorithm using stochastic partitions. Finally, we apply the
proposed (semi-) algorithms to infer intermediate assumptions in an automated
assume-guarantee verification framework for probabilistic systems.
