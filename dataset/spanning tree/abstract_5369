Soft multi-photon radiation from hard higher energy reaction sources can be
employed to describe three major well established properties of biophoton
radiation; Namely, (i) the mild radiation intensity decreases for higher
frequencies, (ii) the coherent state Poisson counting statistics, and (iii) the
time delayed luminescence with a hyperbolic time tail. Since the soft photon
frequencies span the visible to the ultraviolet frequency range, the hard
reaction sources have energies extending into the nuclear transmutation regime.
