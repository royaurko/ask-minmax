In this paper a general class of tree algorithms is analyzed. It is shown
that, by using an appropriate probabilistic representation of the quantities of
interest, the asymptotic behavior of these algorithms can be obtained quite
easily without resorting to the usual complex analysis techniques. This
approach gives a unified probabilistic treatment of these questions. It
simplifies and extends some of the results known in this domain.
