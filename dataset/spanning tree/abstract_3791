The paper gives an example of a tree language G that is recognised by an
unambiguous parity automaton and is analytic-complete as a set in Cantor space.
This already shows that the unambiguous languages are topologically more
complex than the deterministic ones, that are all coanalytic.
  Using set G as a building block we construct an unambiguous language that is
topologically harder than any countable boolean combination of analytic and
coanalytic sets. In particular the language is harder than any set in
difference hierarchy of analytic sets considered by O.Finkel and P.Simonnet in
the context of nondeterministic automata.
