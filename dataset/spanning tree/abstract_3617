The reconstruction problem on the tree has been studied in numerous contexts
including statistical physics, information theory and computational biology.
However, rigorous reconstruction thresholds have only been established in a
small number of models. We prove the first exact reconstruction threshold in a
non-binary model establishing the Kesten-Stigum bound for the 3-state Potts
model on regular trees of large degree. We further establish that the
Kesten-Stigum bound is not tight for the $q$-state Potts model when $q \geq 5$.
Moreover, we determine asymptotics for the reconstruction thresholds.
