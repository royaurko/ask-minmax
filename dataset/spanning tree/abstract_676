In this paper we give a much more efficient proof that the real Euclidean phi
4-model on the four-dimensional Moyal plane is renormalizable to all orders. We
prove rigorous bounds on the propagator which complete the previous
renormalization proof based on renormalization group equations for non-local
matrix models. On the other hand, our bounds permit a powerful multi-scale
analysis of the resulting ribbon graphs. Here, the dual graphs play a
particular r\^ole because the angular momentum conservation is conveniently
represented in the dual picture. Choosing a spanning tree in the dual graph
according to the scale attribution, we prove that the summation over the loop
angular momenta can be performed at no cost so that the power-counting is
reduced to the balance of the number of propagators versus the number of
completely inner vertices in subgraphs of the dual graph.
