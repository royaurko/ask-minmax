We live in a world where our personal data are both valuable and vulnerable
to misappropriation through exploitation of security vulnerabilities in online
services. For instance, Dropbox, a popular cloud storage tool, has certain
security flaws that can be exploited to compromise a user's data, one of which
being that a user's access pattern is unprotected. We have thus created an
implementation of Path Oblivious RAM (Path ORAM) for Dropbox users to obfuscate
path access information to patch this vulnerability. This implementation
differs significantly from the standard usage of Path ORAM, in that we
introduce several innovations, including a dynamically growing and shrinking
tree architecture, multi-block fetching, block packing and the possibility for
multi-client use. Our optimizations together produce about a 77% throughput
increase and a 60% reduction in necessary tree size; these numbers vary with
file size distribution.
