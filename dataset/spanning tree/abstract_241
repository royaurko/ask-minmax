In this work we demonstrate the ability of the Minimal Spanning Tree to
duplicate the information contained within a percolation analysis for a point
dataset. We show how to construct the percolation properties from the Minimal
Spanning Tree, finding roughly an order of magnitude improvement in the
computer time required. We apply these statistics to Particle-Mesh simulations
of large-scale structure formation. We consider purely scale-free Gaussian
initial conditions ($P(k) \propto k^n$, with $n = -2, -1, 0 \ \& +1$) in a
critical density universe. We find in general the mass of the percolating
cluster is a much better quantity by which to judge the onset of percolation
than the length of the percolating cluster.
