The excitation of a slow extraordinary wave in a overdense plasma from an
ordinary wave impinging on the critical layer in the plane spanned by the
density gradient and magnetic field is solved analytically by formulating the
problem in terms of a parabolic cylinder equation. A formula for the angular
dependence of the transmission coefficient is derived.
