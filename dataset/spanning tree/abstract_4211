We present an algorithm for writing down explicit formulas for all tree
amplitudes in N=8 supergravity, obtained from solving the supersymmetric
on-shell recursion relations. The formula is patterned after one recently
obtained for all tree amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills which involves nested
sums of dual superconformal invariants. We find that all graviton amplitudes
can be written in terms of exactly the same structure of nested sums with two
modifications: the dual superconformal invariants are promoted from N=4 to N=8
superspace in the simplest manner possible--by squaring them--and certain
additional non-dual conformal gravity dressing factors (independent of the
superspace coordinates) are inserted into the nested sums. To illustrate the
procedure we give explicit closed-form formulas for all NMHV, NNMHV and NNNMV
gravity superamplitudes.
