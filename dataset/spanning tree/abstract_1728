In this paper we are going to find a rooted tree representation from
universal Hopf algebra of renormalization (in Connes-Marcolli's approach in the
study of renormalizable Quantum Field Theories under the scheme minimal
subtraction in dimensional regularization). With attention to this new picture,
interesting relations between this specific Hopf algebra and some important
Hopf algebras of rooted trees and also Hopf algebra of (quasi-) symmetric
functions are obtained. And moreover a new interpretation from universal
singular frame, based on Hall rooted trees, is deduced such that it can be
applied to the physical information of a renormalizable theory such as
counterterms.
