A formalism for semi-adiabatic cranking mass parameters is presented. For the
fission process of 234U, the time-dependent pairing equations of motion were
used to calculate the excitation energy and to extract values of the cranking
inertia. A fission barrier is determined by minimizing the action trajectory in
a five dimensional configuration space spanned by elongation, necking,
deformations of fragments and mass-asymmetry. The deformation energy is
computed in the the frame of the microscopic-macroscopic model. The two center
shell model with Woods-Saxon potentials is used in this context. Values of the
inertia for excited fissioning systems are reported. A dependence between the
cranking mass parameters and the intrinsic excitation energy is evidenced.
