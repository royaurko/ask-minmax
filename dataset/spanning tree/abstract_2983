We study a circular order on labelled, m-edge-coloured trees with k vertices,
and show that the set of such trees with a fixed circular order is in bijection
with the set of RNA m-diagrams of degree k, combinatorial objects which can be
regarded as RNA secondary structures of a certain kind. We enumerate these sets
and show that the set of trees with a fixed circular order can be characterized
as an equivalence class for the transitive closure of an operation which, in
the case m=3, arises as an induction in the context of interval exchange
transformations.
