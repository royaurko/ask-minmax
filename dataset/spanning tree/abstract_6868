Cryopreservation is beset with the challenge of protocol alignment across a
wide range of cell types and process variables. By taking a cross-sectional
assessment of previously published cryopreservation data (sample means and
standard errors) as preliminary meta-data, a decision tree learning analysis
(DTLA) was performed to develop an understanding of target survival and
optimized pruning methods based on different approaches. Briefly, a clear
direction on the decision process for selection of methods was developed with
key choices being the cooling rate, plunge temperature on the one hand and
biomaterial choice, use of composites (sugars and proteins), loading procedure
and cell location in 3D scaffold on the other. Secondly, using machine learning
and generalized approaches via the Na\"ive Bayes Classification (NBC) approach,
these metadata were used to develop posterior probabilities for combinatorial
approaches that were implicitly recorded in the metadata. These latter results
showed that newer protocol choices developed using probability elicitation
techniques can unearth improved protocols consistent with multiple
unidimensional optimized physical protocols. In conclusion, this article
proposes the use of DTLA models and subsequently NBC for the improvement of
modern cryopreservation techniques through an integrative approach.
