With the rise of XML as a standard for representing business data, XML data
warehousing appears as a suitable solution for decision-support applications.
In this context, it is necessary to allow OLAP analyses on XML data cubes.
Thus, XQuery extensions are needed. To define a formal framework and allow
much-needed performance optimizations on analytical queries expressed in
XQuery, defining an algebra is desirable. However, XML-OLAP (XOLAP) algebras
from the literature still largely rely on the relational model. Hence, we
propose in this paper a rollup operator based on a pattern tree in order to
handle multidimensional XML data expressed within complex hierarchies.
