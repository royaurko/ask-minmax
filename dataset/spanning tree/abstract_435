We consider the stochastic geometry model where the location of each node is
a random point in a given metric space, or the existence of each node is
uncertain. We study the problems of computing the expected lengths of several
combinatorial or geometric optimization problems over stochastic points,
including closest pair, minimum spanning tree, $k$-clustering, minimum perfect
matching, and minimum cycle cover. We also consider the problem of estimating
the probability that the length of closest pair, or the diameter, is at most,
or at least, a given threshold. Most of the above problems are known to be
$\sharpP$-hard. We obtain FPRAS (Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation
Scheme) for most of them in both the existential and locational uncertainty
models. Our result for stochastic minimum spanning trees in the locational
uncertain model improves upon the previously known constant factor
approximation algorithm. Our results for other problems are the first known to
the best of our knowledge.
