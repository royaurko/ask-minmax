We propose a new kind of interferometric array that yields images of high
dynamic range and large field. The numerous individual apertures in this array
form a pattern related to a Fresnel zone plate. This array can be used for
astrophysical imaging over a broad spectral bandwidth spanning from the U.V.
(50 nanometers) to the I.R. (20 microns). Due to the long focal lengths
involved, this instrument requires formation-flying of two space borne vessels.
We present the concept and study the S/N ratio in different situations, then
apply these results to probe the suitability of this concept to detect
exoplanets.
