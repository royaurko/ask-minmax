We show how the link variables of Arkani-Hamed, Cachazo, Cheung and Kaplan
(ACCK), can be used to compute general gluon tree amplitudes in the twistor
string. They arise from instanton sectors labelled by d, with d=n-1, where n is
the number of negative helicities. Read backwards, this shows how the various
forms for the tree amplitudes studied by ACCK can be grouped into contour
integrals whose structure implies the existence of an underlying string theory.
