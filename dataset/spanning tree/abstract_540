We give a new simple construction of the sandpile measure on an infinite
graph G, under the sole assumption that each tree in the Wired Uniform Spanning
Forest on G has one end almost surely. For, the so called, generalized minimal
configurations the limiting probability on G exists even without this
assumption. We also give determinantal formulas for minimal configurations on
general graphs in terms of the transfer current matrix.
