We consider nearest-neighbor fertile hard-core models, with three states, on
a homogeneous Cayley tree. It is known that there are four type of such models.
We investigate all of them and describe translation-invariant and periodic
hard-core Gibbs measures. Also we construct a continuum set of non-periodic
Gibbs measures.
