We report the detection of 19 new high-energy gamma-ray sources closely
associated with BL Lac objects at energies higher than 10 GeV in the 6.3 years
Fermi-Large Area Telescope sky, selected using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
clustering method. Photon clusters with good selection parameters were found
matching the positions of known blazars in the fifth Roma-BZCAT catalogue. A
brief summary of the properties of these sources is presented.
