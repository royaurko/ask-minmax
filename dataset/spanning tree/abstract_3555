The tropical Grassmannian parameterizes tropicalizations of linear spaces,
while the Dressian parameterizes all planes in $\TP^{n-1}$. We study these
parameter spaces and we compute them explicitly for $n \leq 7$. Planes are
identified with matroid subdivisions and with arrangements of trees. These
representations are used to draw pictures.
