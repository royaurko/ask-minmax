Cascaded nonlinearities have attracted much interest, but ultrafast
applications have been seriously hampered by the simultaneous requirements of
being near phase-matching and having ultrafast femtosecond response times. Here
we show that in strongly phase-mismatched nonlinear frequency conversion
crystals the pump pulse can experience a large and extremely broadband
self-defocusing cascaded Kerr-like nonlinearity. The large cascaded
nonlinearity is ensured through interaction with the largest quadratic tensor
element in the crystal, and the strong phase-mismatch ensures an ultrafast
nonlinear response with an octave-spanning bandwidth. We verify this
experimentally by showing few-cycle soliton compression with noncritical
cascaded second-harmonic generation: Energetic 47 fs infrared pulses are
compressed in a just 1-mm long bulk lithium niobate crystal to 17 fs (under 4
optical cycles) with 80% efficiency, and upon further propagation an
octave-spanning supercontinuum is observed. Such ultrafast cascading is
expected to occur for a broad range of pump wavelengths spanning the near- and
mid-IR using standard nonlinear crystals.
