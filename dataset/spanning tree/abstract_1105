We consider the state complexity of basic operations on tree languages
recognized by deterministic unranked tree automata. For the operations of union
and intersection the upper and lower bounds of both weakly and strongly
deterministic tree automata are obtained. For tree concatenation we establish a
tight upper bound that is of a different order than the known state complexity
of concatenation of regular string languages. We show that (n+1) (
(m+1)2^n-2^(n-1) )-1 vertical states are sufficient, and necessary in the worst
case, to recognize the concatenation of tree languages recognized by (strongly
or weakly) deterministic automata with, respectively, m and n vertical states.
