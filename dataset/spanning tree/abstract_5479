Settling a first case of a conjecture of M. Kahle on the homology of the
clique complex of the random graph $G=G_{n,p}$, we show, roughly speaking, that
(with high probability) the triangles of $G$ span its cycle space whenever each
of its edges lies in a triangle (which happens (w.h.p.) when $p$ is at least
about $\sqrt{(3/2)\ln n/n}$, and not below this unless $p$ is very small.) We
give two related proofs of this statement, together with a relatively simple
proof of a fundamental "stability" theorem for triangle-free subgraphs of
$G_{n,p}$, originally due to Kohayakawa, \L uczak and R\"odl, that underlies
the first of our proofs.
