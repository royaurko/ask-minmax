We present a model for the scaling laws of the electric field noise spectral
density as a function of the distance, $d$, above a conducting surface. Our
analytical approach models the patch potentials by introducing a correlation
length, $\zeta$, of the electric potential on the surface. The predicted
scaling laws are in excellent agreement with two different classes of
experiments (cold trapped ions and cantilevers), that span at least four orders
of magnitude of $d$. According to this model, heating rate in miniature ion
traps could be greatly reduced by proper material engineering.
