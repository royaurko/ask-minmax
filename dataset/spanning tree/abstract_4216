In this paper we study the structure of the limit aggregate $A_\infty =
\bigcup_{n\geq 0} A_n$ of the one-dimensional long range diffusion limited
aggregation process defined in [AABK09]. We show (under some regularity
conditions) that for walks with finite third moment $A_\infty$ has renewal
structure and positive density, while for walks with finite variance the
renewal structure no longer exists and $A_\infty$ has 0 density. We define a
tree structure on the aggregates and show some results on the degrees and
number of ends of these random trees. We introduce a new "harmonic competition"
model where different colours compete for harmonic measure, and show how the
tree structure is related to coexistence in this model.
