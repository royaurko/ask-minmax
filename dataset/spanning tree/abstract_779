We implement a master-slave parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) with a bespoke
log-likelihood fitness function to identify emergent clusters within price
evolutions. We use graphics processing units (GPUs) to implement a PGA and
visualise the results using disjoint minimal spanning trees (MSTs). We
demonstrate that our GPU PGA, implemented on a commercially available general
purpose GPU, is able to recover stock clusters in sub-second speed, based on a
subset of stocks in the South African market. This represents a pragmatic
choice for low-cost, scalable parallel computing and is significantly faster
than a prototype serial implementation in an optimised C-based
fourth-generation programming language, although the results are not directly
comparable due to compiler differences. Combined with fast online intraday
correlation matrix estimation from high frequency data for cluster
identification, the proposed implementation offers cost-effective,
near-real-time risk assessment for financial practitioners.
