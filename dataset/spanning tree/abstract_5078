Using molecular dynamics computer simulations we investigate the structural
and dynamical properties of a simple model for a colloidal gel at low volume
fraction. We find that at low T the system is forming an open percolating
cluster, without any sign of a phase separation. The nature of the relaxation
dynamics depends strongly on the length scale/wave-vector considered and can be
directly related to the geometrical properties of the spanning cluster.
