We characterize clique trees of a chordal graph in their relation to
simplicial vertices and perfect sequences of maximal cliques. We investigate
boundary cliques defined by Shibata and clarify their relation to endpoints of
clique trees. Next we define a symmetric binary relation between the set of
clique trees and the set of perfect sequences of maximal cliques. We describe
the relation as a bipartite graph and prove that the bipartite graph is always
connected. Lastly we consider to characterize chordal graphs from the aspect of
non-uniqueness of clique trees.
