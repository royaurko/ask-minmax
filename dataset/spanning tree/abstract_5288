The manganite (La,Pr,Ca)MnO3 is well known for its micrometer scale phase
separation into coexisting ferromagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic
insulating (AFI) regions. Fabricating bridges with widths smaller than the
phase separation length scale has allowed us to probe the magnetic properties
of individual phase separated regions. We observe tunneling magnetoresistance
across naturally occurring AFI tunnel barriers separating adjacent
ferromagnetic regions spanning the width of the bridges. Further, near the
Curie temperature, a magnetic field induced metal-to-insulator transition among
a discrete number of regions within the narrow bridges gives rise to abrupt and
colossal low-field magnetoresistance steps at well defined switching fields.
