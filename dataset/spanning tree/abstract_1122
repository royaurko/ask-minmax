We investigate the class of the edge-shelling convex geometries of trees. The
edge-shelling convex geometry of a tree is the convex geometry consisting of
the sets of edges of the subtrees. For the edge-shelling convex geometry of a
tree, the size of the stem of any rooted circuit is two. The class of the
edge-shelling convex geometry of a tree is closed under trace operation. We
characterize the class of the edge-shelling convex geometry of a tree in terms
of trace-minimal forbidden minors. Moreover, the trace-minimal forbidden minors
are specified for the class of convex geometries such that the size of any stem
is two.
