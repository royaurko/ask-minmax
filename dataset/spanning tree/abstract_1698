For a labelled tree on the vertex set $[n]:=\{1,2,..., n\}$, define the
direction of each edge $ij$ to be $i\to j$ if $i<j$. The indegree sequence of
$T$ can be considered as a partition $\lambda \vdash n-1$. The enumeration of
trees with a given indegree sequence arises in counting secant planes of curves
in projective spaces. Recently Ethan Cotterill conjectured a formula for the
number of trees on $[n]$ with indegree sequence corresponding to a partition
$\lambda$. In this paper we give two proofs of Cotterill's conjecture: one is
`semi-combinatorial" based on induction, the other is a bijective proof.
