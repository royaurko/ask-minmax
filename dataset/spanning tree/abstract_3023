Phylogenetic invariants are not the only constraints on site-pattern
frequency vectors for phylogenetic trees. A mutation matrix, by its definition,
is the exponential of a matrix with non-negative off-diagonal entries; this
positivity requirement implies non-trivial constraints on the site-pattern
frequency vectors. We call these additional constraints ``edge-parameter
inequalities.'' In this paper, we first motivate the edge-parameter
inequalities by considering a pathological site-pattern frequency vector
corresponding to a quartet tree with a negative internal edge. This
site-pattern frequency vector nevertheless satisfies all of the constraints
described up to now in the literature. We next describe two complete sets of
edge-parameter inequalities for the group-based models; these constraints are
square-free monomial inequalities in the Fourier transformed coordinates. These
inequalities, along with the phylogenetic invariants, form a complete
description of the set of site-pattern frequency vectors corresponding to
\emph{bona fide} trees. Said in mathematical language, this paper explicitly
presents two finite lists of inequalities in Fourier coordinates of the form
``monomial $\leq 1$,'' each list characterizing the phylogenetically relevant
semialgebraic subsets of the phylogenetic varieties.
