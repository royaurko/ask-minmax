In this work we introduce the principles of an algorithm that constructs and
maintains a spanning forest in a mobile telecommunication network-a MANET. The
algorithm is based on the random walk of a token and is entirely decentralized.
A probability analysis is performed when the network is static. Then we show
that performances can be slightly enhanced when adding a memory process in the
walk on the token.
