We review the recent developments of the loop-tree duality method, focussing
our discussion on analysing the singular behaviour of the loop integrand of the
dual representation of one-loop integrals and scattering amplitudes. We show
that within the loop-tree duality method there is a partial cancellation of
singularities at the integrand level among the different components of the
corresponding dual representation. The remaining threshold and infrared
singularities are restricted to a finite region of the loop momentum space,
which is of the size of the external momenta and can be mapped to the
phase-space of real corrections to cancel the soft and collinear divergences.
