Motivated by the hinge structure present in protein chains and other
molecular conformations, we study the singularities of certain maps associated
to body-and-hinge and panel-and-hinge chains. These are sequentially
articulated systems where two consecutive rigid pieces are connected by a
hinge, that is, a codimension two axis.
  The singularities, or critical points, correspond to a dimensional drop in
the linear span of the axes, regarded as points on a Grassmann variety in its
Pl\"{u}cker embedding. These results are valid in arbitrary dimension. The
three dimensional case is also relevant in robotics.
