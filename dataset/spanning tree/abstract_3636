Every business needs knowledge about their competitors to survive better. One
of the information repositories is web. Retrieving Specific information from
the web is challenging. An Ontological model is developed to capture specific
information by using web semantics. From the Ontology model, the relations
between the data are mined using decision tree. From all these a new framework
is developed for Business Intelligence.
