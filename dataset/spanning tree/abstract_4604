We present Monte Carlo simulations of the spanning-forest model (q \to 0
limit of the ferromagnetic Potts model) in spatial dimensions d=3,4,5. We show
that, in contrast to the two-dimensional case, the model has a "ferromagnetic"
second-order phase transition at a finite positive value w_c. We present
numerical estimates of w_c and of the thermal and magnetic critical exponents.
We conjecture that the upper critical dimension is 6.
