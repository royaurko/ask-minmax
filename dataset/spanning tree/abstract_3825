We propose a hybrid tree-finite difference method in order to approximate the
Heston model. We prove the convergence by embedding the procedure in a
bivariate Markov chain and we study the convergence of European and American
option prices. We finally provide numerical experiments that give accurate
option prices in the Heston model, showing the reliability and the efficiency
of the algorithm.
