If X is a convex-transitive Banach space and 1\leq p\leq \infty then the
closed linear span of the simple functions in the Bochner space L^{p}([0,1],X)
is convex-transitive. If H is an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and
C_{0}(L) is convex-transitive, then C_{0}(L,H) is convex-transitive. Some new
fairly concrete examples of convex-transitive spaces are provided.
