We calculate the mean and almost-sure leading order behaviour of the high
frequency asymptotics of the eigenvalue counting function associated with the
natural Dirichlet form on $\alpha$-stable trees, which lead in turn to
short-time heat kernel asymptotics for these random structures. In particular,
the conclusions we obtain demonstrate that the spectral dimension of an
$\alpha$-stable tree is almost-surely equal to $2\alpha/(2\alpha-1)$, matching
that of certain related discrete models. We also show that the exponent for the
second term in the asymptotic expansion of the eigenvalue counting function is
no greater than $1/(2\alpha-1)$. To prove our results, we adapt a self-similar
fractal argument previously applied to the continuum random tree, replacing the
decomposition of the continuum tree at the branch point of three suitably
chosen vertices with a recently developed spinal decomposition for
$\alpha$-stable trees.
