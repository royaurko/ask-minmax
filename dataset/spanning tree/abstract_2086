We describe our current understanding on the phase transition phenomenon of
the graph Laplacian eigenvectors constructed on a certain type of unweighted
trees, which we previously observed through our numerical experiments. The
eigenvalue distribution for such a tree is a smooth bell-shaped curve starting
from the eigenvalue 0 up to 4. Then, at the eigenvalue 4, there is a sudden
jump. Interestingly, the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues below 4
are semi-global oscillations (like Fourier modes) over the entire tree or one
of the branches; on the other hand, those corresponding to the eigenvalues
above 4 are much more localized and concentrated (like wavelets) around
junctions/branching vertices. For a special class of trees called starlike
trees, we obtain a complete understanding of such phase transition phenomenon.
For a general graph, we prove the number of the eigenvalues larger than 4 is
bounded from above by the number of vertices whose degrees is strictly higher
than 2. Moreover, we also prove that if a graph contains a branching path, then
the magnitudes of the components of any eigenvector corresponding to the
eigenvalue greater than 4 decay exponentially from the branching vertex toward
the leaf of that branch.
