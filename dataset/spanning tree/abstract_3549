We show that any periodic with respect to normal subgroups (of the group
representation of the Cayley tree) of finite index $p$-harmonic function is a
constant. For some normal subgroups of infinite index we describe a class of
(non-constant) periodic $p$-harmonic functions. If $p\neq2$, the
$p$-harmonicity is non-linear, i.e., the linear combination of $p$-harmonic
functions need not be $p$-harmonic. In spite of this, we show that linear
combinations of the $p$-harmonic functions described for normal subgroups of
infinite index are also $p$-harmonic.
