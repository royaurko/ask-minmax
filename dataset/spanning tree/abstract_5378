A method for determining the dimension and state space geometry of inertial
manifolds of dissipative extended dynamical systems is presented. It works by
projecting vector differences between reference states and recurrent states
onto local linear subspaces spanned by the Lyapunov vectors. A sharp
characteristic transition of the projection error occurs as soon as the number
of basis vectors is increased beyond the inertial manifold dimension. Since the
method can be applied using standard orthogonal Lyapunov vectors, it provides a
simple way to determine also experimentally inertial manifolds and their
geometric characteristics.
