A well known problem with Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) prediction is
that a prediction strategy proved to be the best for some testing time span and
prediction length may not remain the same for other time intervals. In this
paper, we consider possible strategies to combine EOP predictions computed
using different analysis techniques to obtain a final prediction with the best
accuracy corresponding to the smallest prediction error of input predictions.
It was found that this approach is most efficient for ultra-short-term EOP
forecast.
