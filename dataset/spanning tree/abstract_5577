The characteristic variety plays an important role in the analysis of the
solution space of partial differential equations and exterior differential
systems. This article studies the linear span of this variety, measuring its
dimension via an integrable extension of the original system. In the PDE case
with locally constant characteristic variety, this extension yields a recursive
version of Guillemin normal form, inducing a sequence of foliations on integral
manifolds.
