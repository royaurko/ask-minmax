We demonstrate efficient generation of a Raman-type optical frequency comb by
employing adiabatic Raman excitation in an enhancement cavity. A broad
frequency comb spanning over 130 THz is realized with an excitation power
reduction exceeding three orders of magnitude compared with a single-pass
configuration.
