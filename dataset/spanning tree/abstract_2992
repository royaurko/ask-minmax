We propose a color decomposition for general tree amplitudes in a SU(2) gauge
theory which is spontaneously broken via the Higgs mechanism. Working in the
unitary gauge, we construct color-ordered amplitudes by explicitly presenting a
set of color-ordered Feynman rules. Those primitive amplitudes are
gauge-invariant, and they preserve perturbative unitarity in the high-energy
limit. Serving as building blocks of color-dressed tree amplitudes, they allow
for efficient evaluation of tree-level scattering amplitudes involving gauge
bosons and the Higgs boson via the Berends-Giele recursion relations for
color-ordered currents. We demonstrate the efficiency of this computational
scheme by calculating on-shell amplitudes for scattering of five, six and nine
W-bosons in the limit of vanishing Weinberg angle.
