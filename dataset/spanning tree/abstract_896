A methodology is developed for data analysis based on empirically constructed
geodesic metric spaces. The population version defines distance by the amount
of probability mass accumulated on travelling between two points and geodesic
metric arises from the shortest path version. Such metrics are then transformed
in a number of ways to produce families of geodesic metric spaces. Empirical
versions of the geodesics allow computation of intrinsic means and associated
measures of dispersion. A version of the empirical geodesic is introduced based
on the graph of some initial complex such as the Delaunay complex. For certain
parameter ranges the spaces become CAT(0) spaces and the intrinsic means are
unique. In the graph case a minimal spanning tree obtained as a limiting case
is CAT(0). In other cases the aggregate squared distance from a test point
provides local minima which yield information about clusters. This is
particularly relevant for metrics based on so-called metric cones which allow
extensions to CAT(k) spaces. After gaining some theoretical understanding the
methods are tested on some small artificial examples, some standard data sets
and some rainfall data.
