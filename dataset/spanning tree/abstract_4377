Object oriented data analysis is the statistical analysis of populations of
complex objects. In the special case of functional data analysis, these data
objects are curves, where standard Euclidean approaches, such as principal
component analysis, have been very successful. Recent developments in medical
image analysis motivate the statistical analysis of populations of more complex
data objects which are elements of mildly non-Euclidean spaces, such as Lie
groups and symmetric spaces, or of strongly non-Euclidean spaces, such as
spaces of tree-structured data objects. These new contexts for object oriented
data analysis create several potentially large new interfaces between
mathematics and statistics. This point is illustrated through the careful
development of a novel mathematical framework for statistical analysis of
populations of tree-structured objects.
