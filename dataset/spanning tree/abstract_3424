When computing the properties of reactions involving unstable charged
particles care has to be taken to use a gauge invariant amplitude. In this talk
we present methods to (automatically) obtain such an amplitude, both at the
tree level and in one-loop calculations, using only a minimal number of
diagrams. The numerical difference with gauge variant methods commonly used
will be discussed for the case of tree level W pair production.
