The multiple protostellar system L1551 IRS5 exhibits a large-scale bipolar
molecular outflow. We have studied this outflow within ~4000 AU of its driving
source(s) with the SubMillimeter Array. Our CO(2-1) image at ~4" (~560 AU)
resolution reveals three distinct components: 1) an X-shaped structure spanning
~20" from center with a similar symmetry axis and velocity pattern as the
large-scale outflow; 2) an S-shaped structure spanning ~10" from center also
with an opposite velocity pattern to the large-scale outflow; and 3) a compact
central component spanning ~1.4" from center again with a similar symmetry axis
and velocity pattern as the large-scale outflow. The X-shaped component likely
comprises the limb-brightened walls of a cone-shaped cavity excavated by the
outflows from the two main protostellar components. The compact central
component likely comprises material newly entrained by one or both outflows
from the two main protostellar components. The S-shaped component mostly likely
comprises a precessing outflow with its symmetry axis inclined in the opposite
sense to the plane of the sky than the other two components. This outflow may
be driven by a recently reported candidate third protostellar component in
L1551 IRS5, whose circumstellar disk is misaligned relative to the two main
protostellar components. Gravitational interactions between this protostellar
component and its more massive northern neighbor may be causing the
circumstellar disk and hence outflow of this component to precess.
