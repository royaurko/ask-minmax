One of the goals of phylogenetic research is to find the species tree
describing the evolutionary history of a set of species. But the trees derived
from geneti data with the help of tree inference methods are gene trees that
need not coincide with the species tree. This can for example happen when
so-called deep coalescence events take place. It is also known that species
trees can differ from their most likely gene trees. Therefore, as a means to
find the species tree, it has been suggested to use subtrees of the gene trees,
for example triples, and to puzzle them together in order to find the species
tree. In this paper, we will show that this approach may lead to wrong trees
regarding the minimum deep coalescence criterion (MDC). In particular, we
present an example in which the optimal MDC tree is unique, but none of its
triple subtrees fulfills the MDC criterion. In this sense, MDC is a
non-hereditary tree reconstruction method.
