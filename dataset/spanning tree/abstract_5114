We investigate some proposals to solve the electric charge quantization
puzzle, which simultaneously explain the recent measured deviation on the muon
anomalous magnetic moment. For this we assess extensions of the Electro-Weak
Standard Model spanning modifications on the scalar sector only. It is
interesting to verify that one can have modest extensions which easily account
for the solution for both problems.
