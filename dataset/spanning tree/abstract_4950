We consider complex Mandelbrot multiplicative cascades on a random weigh\-ted
tree. Under suitable assumptions, this yields a dynamics $\T$ on laws invariant
by random weighted means (the so called fixed points of smoothing
transformations) and which have a finite moment of order 2. Moreover, we can
exhibit two main behaviors: If the weights are conservative, i.e., sum up to~1
almost surely, we find a domain for the initial law $\mu$ such that a
non-standard (functional) central limit theorem is valid for the orbit
$(\T^n\mu)_{n\ge 0}$ (this completes in a non trivial way our previous result
in the case of non-negative Mandelbrot cascades on a regular tree). If the
weights are non conservative, we find a domain for the initial law $\mu$ over
which $(\T^n\mu)_{n\ge 0}$ converges to the law of a non trivial random
variable whose law turns out to be a fixed point of a quadratic smoothing
transformation, which naturally extends the usual notion of (linear) smoothing
transformation; moreover, this limit law can be built as the limit of a
non-negative martingale. Also, the dynamics can be modified to build fixed
points of higher degree smoothing transformations.
