We present the discovery of eight quasars at z~6 identified in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) overlap regions. Individual SDSS imaging runs have
some overlap with each other, leading to repeat observations over an area
spanning >4000 deg^2 (more than 1/4 of the total footprint). These overlap
regions provide a unique dataset that allows us to select high-redshift quasars
more than 0.5 mag fainter in the z band than those found with the SDSS
single-epoch data. Our quasar candidates were first selected as i-band dropout
objects in the SDSS imaging database. We then carried out a series of follow-up
observations in the optical and near-IR to improve photometry, remove
contaminants, and identify quasars. The eight quasars reported here were
discovered in a pilot study utilizing the overlap regions at high galactic
latitude (|b|>30 deg). These quasars span a redshift range of 5.86<z<6.06 and a
flux range of 19.3<z_AB<20.6 mag. Five of them are fainter than z_AB=20 mag,
the typical magnitude limit of z~6 quasars used for the SDSS single-epoch
images. In addition, we recover eight previously known quasars at z~6 that are
located in the overlap regions. These results validate our procedure for
selecting quasar candidates from the overlap regions and confirming them with
follow-up observations, and provide guidance to a future systematic survey over
all SDSS imaging regions with repeat observations.
