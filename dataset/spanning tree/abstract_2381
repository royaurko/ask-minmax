This paper proposes a data tree-rewriting framework for modeling evolving
documents. The framework is close to Guarded Active XML, a platform used for
handling XML repositories evolving through web services. We focus on automatic
verification of properties of evolving documents that can contain data from an
infinite domain. We establish the boundaries of decidability, and show that
verification of a {\em positive} fragment that can handle recursive service
calls is decidable. We also consider bounded model-checking in our data
tree-rewriting framework and show that it is $\nexptime$-complete.
