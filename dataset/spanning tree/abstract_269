We study three representations of hierarchies of partitions: dendrograms
(direct representations), saliency maps, and minimum spanning trees. We provide
a new bijection between saliency maps and hierarchies based on quasi-flat zones
as used in image processing and characterize saliency maps and minimum spanning
trees as solutions to constrained minimization problems where the constraint is
quasi-flat zones preservation. In practice, these results form a toolkit for
new hierarchical methods where one can choose the most convenient
representation. They also invite us to process non-image data with
morphological hierarchies.
