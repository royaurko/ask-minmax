A {\it star-factor} of a graph $G$ is a spanning subgraph of $G$ such that
each component of which is a star. An {\it edge-weighting} of $G$ is a function
$w: E(G)\longrightarrow \mathbb{N}^+$, where $\mathbb{N}^+$ is the set of
positive integers. Let $\Omega$ be the family of all graphs $G$ such that every
star-factor of $G$ has the same weights under a fixed edge-weighting $w$. In
this paper, we present a simple structural characterization of the graphs in
$\Omega$ that have girth at least five.
