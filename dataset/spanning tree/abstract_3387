We report on a theoretical analysis, consisting of both numerical and
analytic work, of the stability of synchronization of a ladder array of
Josephson junctions under the influence of current induced magnetic fields.
Surprisingly, we find that as the ratio of the mutual to self inductance of the
cells of the array is increased a region of unstable behavior occurs followed
by reentrant stable synchronization. Analytic work tells us that in order to
understand fully the cause of the observed instabilities the behavior of the
vertical junctions, sometimes ignored in analytic analyses of ladder arrays,
must be taken into account.
