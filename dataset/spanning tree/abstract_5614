A rigorous derivation is provided for canonical correlations and partial
canonical correlations for certain Hilbert space indexed stochastic processes.
The formulation relies on a key congruence mapping between the space spanned by
a second order, $\mathcal{H}$-valued, process and a particular Hilbert function
space deriving from the process' covariance operator. The main results are
obtained via an application of methodology for constructing orthogonal direct
sums from algebraic direct sums of closed subspaces.
