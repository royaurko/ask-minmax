The group of isometries W of a regular rooted tree, and many of its subgroups
with branching structure, have groups of automorphisms induced by conjugation
in W. This fact has stimulated the computation of the group of automorphisms of
such well-known examples as the group G studied by R. Grigorchuk, and the group
H studied by N. Gupta and the second contributor.
  In this paper, we pursue the larger theme of towers of automorphisms of
groups of tree isometries such as G and H. We describe this tower for all
groups acting on the binary rooted tree which decompose as infinitely iterated
wreath products. Furthermore, we describe fully the towers of G and H.
  More precisely, the tower of G is infinite countable, and the terms of the
tower are 2-groups. Quotients of successive terms are infinite elementary
abelian 2-groups.
  In contrast, the tower of H has length 2, and its terms are {2,3}-groups. We
show that the quotient aut^2(H)/aut(H) is an elementary abelian 3-group of
countably infinite rank, while aut^3(H)=aut^2(H).
