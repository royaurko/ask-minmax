Total cross sections for neutron scattering with energies between 10 and 600
MeV and from nine nuclei spanning the mass range from 6Li to 238U have been
analyzed using a simple function of three parameters. The values of those
parameters with which neutron total cross section data are replicated vary
smoothly with energy and target mass and may themselves be represented by
functions of energy and mass.
