Uniform spanning trees are a statistical model obtained by taking the set of
all spanning trees on a given graph (such as a portion of a cubic lattice in d
dimensions), with equal probability for each distinct tree. Some properties of
such trees can be obtained in terms of the Laplacian matrix on the graph, by
using Grassmann integrals. We use this to obtain exact exponents that bound
those for the power-law decay of the probability that k distinct branches of
the tree pass close to each of two distinct points, as the size of the lattice
tends to infinity.
