Let Delta>1 be a fixed integer. We show that the random graph G(n,p) with
p>>(log n/n)^{1/Delta} is robust with respect to the containment of almost
spanning bipartite graphs H with maximum degree Delta and sublinear bandwidth
in the following sense: asymptotically almost surely, if an adversary deletes
arbitrary edges in G(n,p) such that each vertex loses less than half of its
neighbours, then the resulting graph still contains a copy of all such H.
