We consider a Galton--Watson tree with offspring distribution $\nu$ of finite
mean. The uniform measure on the boundary of the tree is obtained by putting
mass $1$ on each vertex of the $n$-th generation and taking the limit $n\to
\infty$. In the case $E[\nu\ln(\nu)]<\infty$, this measure has been well
studied, and it is known that the Hausdorff dimension of the measure is equal
to $\ln(m)$ (\cite{hawkes}, \cite{lpp95}). When $E[\nu \ln(\nu)]=\infty$, we
show that the dimension drops to $0$. This answers a question of Lyons,
Pemantle and Peres \cite{LyPemPer97}.
