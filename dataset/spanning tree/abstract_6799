The interval graph for a set of intervals on a line consists of one vertex
for each interval, and an edge for each intersecting pair of intervals. A probe
interval graph is a variant that is motivated by an application to genomics,
where the intervals are partitioned into two sets: probes and non-probes. The
graph has an edge between two vertices if they intersect and at least one of
them is a probe. We give a linear-time algorithm for determining whether a
given graph and partition of vertices into probes and non-probes is a probe
interval graph. If it is, we give a layout of intervals that proves this. We
can also determine whether the layout of the intervals is uniquely constrained
within the same time bound. As part of the algorithm, we solve the
consecutive-ones probe matrix problem in linear time, develop algorithms for
operating on PQ trees, and give results that relate PQ trees for different
submatrices of a consecutive-ones matrix.
