We consider Markov chains on partially ordered sets that generalize the
success-runs and remaining life chains in reliability theory. We find
conditions for recurrence and transience and give simple expressions for the
invariant distributions. We study a number of special cases, including rooted
trees, uniform posets, and posets associated with positive semigroups.
