We introduce in this section an Algebraic and Combinatorial approach to the
theory of Numbers. The approach rests on the observation that numbers can be
identified with familiar combinatorial objects namely rooted trees, which we
shall here refer to as towers. The bijection between numbers and towers
provides some insights into unexpected connexions between Number theory,
combinatorics and discrete probability theory.
