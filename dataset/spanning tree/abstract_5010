We derive a fully relativistic, self-similar solution to describe the
propagation of a shock along an exponentially decreasing atmosphere, in the
limit of very large Lorentz factor. We solve the problem in planar symmetry and
compute the acceleration of the shock in terms of the density gradient crossed
during its evolution. We apply our solution to the acceleration of shocks
within the atmosphere of a HyperNova, and show that velocities consistent with
the requirements of GRB models can be achieved with exponential atmospheres
spanning a wide density range.
