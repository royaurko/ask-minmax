This paper gives a direct proof that the leading trace part of the genus zero
twistor-string path integral obeys the BCFW recursion relation. This is the
first complete proof that the twistor-string correctly computes all tree
amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The recursion has a
beautiful geometric interpretation in twistor space that closely reflects the
structure of BCFW recursion in momentum space, both on the one hand as a
relation purely among tree amplitudes with shifted external momenta, and on the
other as a relation between tree amplitudes and leading singularities of higher
loop amplitudes. The proof works purely at the level of the string path
integral and is intimately related to the recursive structure of boundary
divisors in the moduli space of stable maps to CP^3.
