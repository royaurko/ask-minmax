The nearest site of massive star formation in Orion is dominated by the
Trapezium subsystem, with its four OB stars and numerous companions. The
question of how these stars came to be in such close proximity has implications
for our understanding of massive star formation and early cluster evolution. A
promising route toward rapid mass segregation was proposed by McMillan et al.
(2007), who showed that the merger product of faster-evolving sub clusters can
inherit their apparent dynamical age from their progenitors. In this paper we
briefly consider this process at a size and time scale more suited for local
and perhaps more typical star formation, with stellar numbers from the hundreds
to thousands. We find that for reasonable ages and cluster sizes, the merger of
sub-clusters can indeed lead to compact configurations of the most massive
stars, a signal seen both in Nature and in large-scale hydrodynamic simulations
of star formation from collapsing molecular clouds, and that sub-virial initial
conditions can make an un-merged cluster display a similar type of mass
segregation. Additionally, we discuss a variation of the minimum spanning tree
mass-segregation technique introduced by Allison et al. (2009).
