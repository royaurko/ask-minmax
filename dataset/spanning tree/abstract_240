Given a metric space on n points, an {\alpha}-approximate universal algorithm
for the Steiner tree problem outputs a distribution over rooted spanning trees
such that for any subset X of vertices containing the root, the expected cost
of the induced subtree is within an {\alpha} factor of the optimal Steiner tree
cost for X. An {\alpha}-approximate differentially private algorithm for the
Steiner tree problem takes as input a subset X of vertices, and outputs a tree
distribution that induces a solution within an {\alpha} factor of the optimal
as before, and satisfies the additional property that for any set X' that
differs in a single vertex from X, the tree distributions for X and X' are
"close" to each other. Universal and differentially private algorithms for TSP
are defined similarly. An {\alpha}-approximate universal algorithm for the
Steiner tree problem or TSP is also an {\alpha}-approximate differentially
private algorithm. It is known that both problems admit O(logn)-approximate
universal algorithms, and hence O(log n)-approximate differentially private
algorithms as well. We prove an {\Omega}(logn) lower bound on the approximation
ratio achievable for the universal Steiner tree problem and the universal TSP,
matching the known upper bounds. Our lower bound for the Steiner tree problem
holds even when the algorithm is allowed to output a more general solution of a
distribution on paths to the root.
