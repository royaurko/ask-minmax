We study invariant percolation processes on the d-regular tree that are
obtained as a factor of an iid process. We show that for large d, the density
of any such percolation process with finite size clusters is at most (1 + o(1))
(log d)/d. This bound is optimal as it can be realized by independent sets of
the d-regular tree. We also provide upper bounds to the density of factor of
iid percolation processes in terms of its correlation between two neighbouring
vertices.
