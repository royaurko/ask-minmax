Lower bounds are given for the depths of R/I^t for t at least one when I is
the edge ideal of a tree or forest. The bounds are given in terms of the
diameter of the tree, or in case of a forest, the largest diameter of a
connected component and the number of connected components. These lower bounds
provide a lower bound on the power for which the depths stabilize.
