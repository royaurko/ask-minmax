In this note we discuss possible separations of exact, massive, tree-level
spin amplitudes into gauge invariant parts. We concentrate our attention on
processes involving two quarks entering a color- neutral current and, thanks to
the QCD interactions, two extra external gluons. We will search for forms
compatible with parton shower languages, without applying approximations or
restrictions on phase space regions. Special emphasis will be put on the
isolation of parts necessary for the construction of evolution kernels for
individual splittings and to some degree for the running coupling constant as
well. Our aim is to better understand the environment necessary to optimally
match hard matrix elements with partons shower algorithms. To avoid
complications and ambiguities related to regularization schemes, we ignore, at
this point, virtual corrections. Our representation is quite universal: any
color-neutral current can be used, in particular our approach is not restricted
to vector currents only.
