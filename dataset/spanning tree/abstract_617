The Laplacian matrix of a simple graph is the difference of the diagonal
matrix of vertex degree and the (0,1) adjacency matrix. In the past decades,
the Laplacian spectrum has received much more and more attention, since it has
been applied to several fields, such as randomized algorithms, combinatorial
optimization problems and machine learning. This paper is primarily a survey of
various aspects of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of a graph for the
past teens. In addition, some new unpublished results and questions are
concluded. Emphasis is given on classifications of the upper and lower bounds
for the Laplacian eigenvalues of graphs (including some special graphs, such as
trees, bipartite graphs, triangular-free graphs, cubic graphs, etc.) as a
function of other graph invariants, such as degree sequence, the average
2-degree, diameter, the maximal independence number, the maximal matching
number, vertex connectivity, the domination number, the number of the spanning
trees, etc.
