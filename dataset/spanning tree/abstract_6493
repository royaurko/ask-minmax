We present some advances, both from a theoretical and from a computational
point of view, on a quadratic vector equation (QVE) arising in Markovian Binary
Trees. Concerning the theoretical advances, some irreducibility assumptions are
relaxed, and the minimality of the solution of the QVE is expressed in terms of
properties of the Jacobian of a suitable function. From the computational point
of view, we elaborate on the Perron vector-based iteration proposed in
[http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0577]. In particular we provide a condition which
ensures that the Perron iteration converges to the sought solution of the QVE.
Moreover we introduce a variant of the algorithm which consists in applying the
Newton method instead of a fixed-point iteration. This method has the same
convergence behaviour as the Perron iteration, since its convergence speed
increases for close-to-critical problems. Moreover, unlike the Perron
iteration, the method has a quadratic convergence. Finally, we show that it is
possible to alter the bilinear form defining the QVE in several ways without
changing the solution. This modification has an impact on convergence speed of
the algorithms.
