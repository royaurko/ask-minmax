Recently we have developed a new method in graph theory based on the
Regularity Lemma. The method is applied to find certain spanning subgraphs in
dense graphs. The other main general tool of the method, beside the Regularity
Lemma, is the so-called Blow-up Lemma. This lemma helps to find bounded degree
spanning subgraphs in $\varepsilon$-regular graphs. Our original proof of the
lemma is not algorithmic, it applies probabilistic methods. In this paper we
provide an algorithmic version of the Blow-up Lemma. The desired subgraph, for
an $n$-vertex graph, can be found in time $O(nM(n))$, where
$M(n)=O(n^{2.376})$ is the time needed to multiply two $n$ by $n$ matrices
with 0,1 entries over the integers. We show that the algorithm can be
parallelized and implemented in $NC^5$.
