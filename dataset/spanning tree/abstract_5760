An explicit perturbative solution to all orders is given for a general class
of nonlinear differential equations. This solution is written as a sum indexed
by rooted trees and uses the Green function of a linearization of the
equations. The modifications due to the presence of zero-modes is considered.
Possible divergence of the integrals can be avoided by using approximate Green
functions.
