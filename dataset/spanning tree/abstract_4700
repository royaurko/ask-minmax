When dynamics in a system proceeds under suppressive external bias, the
system can undergo an abrupt phase transition, as it occurs for example in the
epidemic spreading. Recently, an explosive percolation (EP) model was
introduced in line with such phenomena. The order of the EP transition has not
been clarified in a unified framework covering low dimensional systems and the
mean-field limit. We introduce a stochastic model, in which a rule for dynamics
is designed to avoid the formation of a spanning cluster through competitive
selection in Euclidean space. We show by heuristic arguments that, in the
thermodynamic limit and depending on a control parameter, the EP transition can
be either continuous or discontinuous if $d < d_c$ and is always continuous if
$d \geq d_c$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension and $d_c$ the upper critical
dimension.
