We introduce and analyze a random tree model associated to Hoppe's urn. The
tree is built successively by adding nodes to the existing tree when starting
with the single root node. In each step a node is added to the tree as a child
of an existing node where these parent nodes are chosen randomly with
probabilities proportional to their weights. The root node has weight
$\vartheta>0$, a given fixed parameter, all other nodes have weight 1. This
resembles the stochastic dynamic of Hoppe's urn. For $\vartheta=1$ the
resulting tree is the well-studied random recursive tree. We analyze the
height, internal path length and number of leaves of the Hoppe tree with $n$
nodes as well as the depth of the last inserted node asymptotically as $n\to
\infty$. Mainly expectations, variances and asymptotic distributions of these
parameters are derived.
