In general the problem of finding a miminum spanning tree for a weighted
directed graph is difficult but solvable. There are a lot of differences
between problems for directed and undirected graphs, therefore the algorithms
for undirected graphs cannot usually be applied to the directed case. In this
paper we examine the kind of weights such that the problems are equivalent and
a minimum spanning tree of a directed graph may be found by a simple algorithm
for an undirected graph.
