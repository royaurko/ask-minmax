Following Poupard's study of strictly ordered binary trees with respect to
two parameters, namely, "end of minimal chain" and "parent of maximum leaf" a
true Tree Calculus is being developed to solve a partial difference equation
system and then make a joint study of those two statistics. Their joint
distribution is shown to be symmetric and to be expressed in the form of an
explicit three-variable generating function.
