The more than 80 nearby galaxies imaged with the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging
Spectrometer have been analyzed in a search for Ultra-Luminous X-ray (ULX)
sources. The sample of galaxies span the range of Hubble morphological types
and include galaxies of various mass, gas content, and dynamical state. X-ray
characteristics of the resulting ensemble of ULX candidates are reported and
correlations with properties of the host galaxies are presented.
