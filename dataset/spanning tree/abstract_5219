The major contributions of Richard H. Dalitz to hypernuclear physics, since
his first paper in 1955 to his last one in 2005 covering a span of 50 years
during which he founded and led the theoretical study of hypernuclei, are
reviewed from a personal perspective. Topical remarks on the search for
quasi-bound antikaon-nuclear states are made.
