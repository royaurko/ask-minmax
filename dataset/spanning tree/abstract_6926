We study a relaxation of the Vector Domination problem called Vector
Connectivity (VecCon). Given a graph $G$ with a requirement $r(v)$ for each
vertex $v$, VecCon asks for a minimum cardinality set $S$ of vertices such that
every vertex $v\in V\setminus S$ is connected to $S$ via $r(v)$ disjoint paths.
In the paper introducing the problem, Boros et al. [Networks, 2014] gave
polynomial-time solutions for VecCon in trees, cographs, and split graphs, and
showed that the problem can be approximated in polynomial time on $n$-vertex
graphs to within a factor of $\log n+2$, leaving open the question of whether
the problem is NP-hard on general graphs. We show that VecCon is APX-hard in
general graphs, and NP-hard in planar bipartite graphs and in planar line
graphs. We also generalize the polynomial result for trees by solving the
problem for block graphs.
