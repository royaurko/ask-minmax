We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of critical Galton-Watson trees
whose offspring distribution may have infinite variance, which are conditioned
on having a large fixed number of leaves. We first find an asymptotic estimate
for the probability of a Galton-Watson tree having $n$ leaves. Secondly, we let
$t_n$ be a critical Galton-Watson tree whose offspring distribution is in the
domain of attraction of a stable law, and conditioned on having exactly $n$
leaves. We show that the rescaled Lukasiewicz path and contour function of
$t_n$ converge respectively to $X^{exc}$ and $H^{exc}$, where $X^{exc}$ is the
normalized excursion of a strictly stable spectrally positive L\'evy process
and $H^{exc}$ is its associated continuous-time height function. As an
application, we investigate the distribution of the maximum degree in a
critical Galton-Watson tree conditioned on having a large number of leaves. We
also explain how these results can be generalized to the case of Galton-Watson
trees which are conditioned on having a large fixed number of vertices with
degree in a given set, thus extending results obtained by Aldous, Duquesne and
Rizzolo.
