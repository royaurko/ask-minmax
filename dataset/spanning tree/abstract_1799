Here we study how the coefficients of characteristics polynomial of
normalized Laplacian of a tree can be described by the higher order general
Randi\'c indices for matching. We find the expression of these indices for
starlike tree and a specific double-starlike tree, $H_m(p,q)$. Moreover, we
show that two cospectral $H_m(p,q)$ of same diameter are isomorphic.
