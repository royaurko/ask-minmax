Convex or concave sequences of $n$ positive terms, viewed as vectors in
$n$-space, constitute convex cones with $2n-2$ and $n$ extreme rays,
respectively. Explicit description is given of vectors spanning these extreme
rays, as well as of non-singular linear transformations between the positive
orthant and the simplicial cones formed by the positive concave vectors. The
simplicial cones of monotone convex and concave vectors can be described
similarly.
