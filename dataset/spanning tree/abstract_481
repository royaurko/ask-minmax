We consider flexible branched polymer, with quenched branch structure, and
show that its conformational entropy as a function of its gyration radius $R$,
at large $R$, obeys, in the scaling sense, $\Delta S \sim R^2/(a^2L)$, with $a$
bond length (or Kuhn segment) and $L$ defined as an average spanning distance.
We show that this estimate is valid up to at most the logarithmic correction
for any tree. We do so by explicitly computing the largest eigenvalues of
Kramers matrices for both regular and "sparse" 3-branched trees, uncovering on
the way their peculiar mathematical properties.
