We show that to n loop order the divergent content of a Feynman amplitude is
spanned by a set of basic (logarithmically divergent) integrals which need not
be evaluated. Only the coefficients of the basic divergent integrals are
necessary to determine renormalization group functions. Relations between these
coefficients of different loop orders are derived.
