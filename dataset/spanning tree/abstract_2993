A new family of tree models is proposed, which we call "differential trees."
A differential tree model is constructed from multiple data sets and aims to
detect distributional differences between them. The new methodology differs
from the existing difference and change detection techniques in its
nonparametric nature, model construction from multiple data sets, and
applicability to high-dimensional data. Through a detailed study of an arson
case in New Zealand, where an individual is known to have been laying
vegetation fires within a certain time period, we illustrate how these models
can help detect changes in the frequencies of event occurrences and uncover
unusual clusters of events in a complex environment.
