We provide a complete description of the Wadge hierarchy for
deterministically recognisable sets of infinite trees. In particular we give an
elementary procedure to decide if one deterministic tree language is
continuously reducible to another. This extends Wagner's results on the
hierarchy of omega-regular languages of words to the case of trees.
