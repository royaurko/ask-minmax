We analyze a new general representation for the Minimum Weight Steiner Tree
(MST) problem which translates the topological connectivity constraint into a
set of local conditions which can be analyzed by the so called cavity equations
techniques. For the limit case of the Spanning tree we prove that the fixed
point of the algorithm arising from the cavity equations leads to the global
optimum.
