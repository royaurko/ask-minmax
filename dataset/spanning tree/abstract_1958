Inferring the ancestral state at the root of a phylogenetic tree from states
observed at the leaves is a problem arising in evolutionary biology. The
simplest technique -- majority rule -- estimates the root state by the most
frequently occurring state at the leaves. Alternative methods -- such as
maximum parsimony - explicitly take the tree structure into account. Since
either method can outperform the other on particular trees, it is useful to
consider the accuracy of the methods on trees generated under some evolutionary
null model, such as a Yule pure-birth model. In this short note, we answer a
recently posed question concerning the performance of majority rule on Yule
trees under a symmetric 2-state Markovian substitution model of character state
change. We show that majority rule is accurate precisely when the ratio of the
birth (speciation) rate of the Yule process to the substitution rate exceeds
the value $4$. By contrast, maximum parsimony has been shown to be accurate
only when this ratio is at least 6. Our proof relies on a second moment
calculation, coupling, and a novel application of a reflection principle.
