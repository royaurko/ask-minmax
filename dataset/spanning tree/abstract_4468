One of the basic tasks which is responded for head of each university
department, is employing lecturers based on some default factors such as
experience, evidences, qualifies and etc. In this respect, to help the heads,
some automatic systems have been proposed until now using machine learning
methods, decision support systems (DSS) and etc. According to advantages and
disadvantages of the previous methods, a full automatic system is designed in
this paper using expert systems. The proposed system is included two main
steps. In the first one, the human expert's knowledge is designed as decision
trees. The second step is included an expert system which is evaluated using
extracted rules of these decision trees. Also, to improve the quality of the
proposed system, a majority voting algorithm is proposed as post processing
step to choose the best lecturer which satisfied more expert's decision trees
for each course. The results are shown that the designed system average
accuracy is 78.88. Low computational complexity, simplicity to program and are
some of other advantages of the proposed system.
