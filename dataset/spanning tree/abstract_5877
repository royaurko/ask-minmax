We study the potential of $\gamma \gamma$ option of future high energy linear
$e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders to search for excited electrons with spin-1/2. We
calculate single production cross sections, give the angular distributions and
$f-m^*$ contour plots for $\sqrt{s}=0.5$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV both using
the standard (tree level) couplings and anomal couplings.
