The scattering process on multiloop infinite p+1-valent graphs (generalized
trees) is studied. These graphs are discrete spaces being quotients of the
uniform tree over free acting discrete subgroups of the projective group
$PGL(2, {\bf Q}_p)$. As the homogeneous spaces, they are, in fact, identical to
p-adic multiloop surfaces. The Ihara-Selberg L-function is associated with the
finite subgraph-the reduced graph containing all loops of the generalized tree.
We study the spectral problem on these graphs, for which we introduce the
notion of spherical functions-eigenfunctions of a discrete Laplace operator
acting on the graph. We define the S-matrix and prove its unitarity. We present
a proof of the Hashimoto-Bass theorem expressing L-function of any finite
(reduced) graph via determinant of a local operator $\Delta(u)$ acting on this
graph and relate the S-matrix determinant to this L-function thus obtaining the
analogue of the Selberg trace formula. The discrete spectrum points are also
determined and classified by the L-function. Numerous examples of L-function
calculations are presented.
