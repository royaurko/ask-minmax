A classical result, fundamental to evolutionary biology, states that an
edge-weighted tree $T$ with leaf set $X$, positive edge weights, and no
vertices of degree 2 can be uniquely reconstructed from the set of leaf-to-leaf
distances between any two elements of $X$. In biology, $X$ corresponds to a set
of taxa (e.g. extant species), the tree $T$ describes their phylogenetic
relationships, the edges correspond to earlier species evolving for a time
until splitting in two or more species by some speciation/bifurcation event,
and their length corresponds to the genetic change accumulating over that time
in such a species. In this paper, we investigate which subsets of
$\binom{X}{2}$ suffice to determine (`lasso') a tree from the leaf-to-leaf
distances induced by that tree. The question is particularly topical since
reliable estimates of genetic distance - even (if not in particular) by modern
mass-sequencing methods - are, in general, available only for certain
combinations of taxa.
