If $G$ is a strongly connected directed graph, the set $\mathcal{T}G$ of
rooted directed spanning trees of $G$ is naturally equipped with a structure of
directed graph: there is a directed edge from any spanning tree to any other
obtained by adding an outgoing edge at its root vertex, and deleting the
outgoing edge of the endpoint. We show that the characteristic polynomial of
the Laplacian matrix of $\mathcal{T}G$ is a product of characteristic
polynomials of submatrices of the Laplacian matrix of $G$ and we give a
combinatorial description of the multiplicities using an exploration procedure
of the graph. A similar factorization can be obtained from earlier results of
C. Athanasiadis which lead to a different expression of the multiplicities, as
signed sums on which the nonnegativity is not apparent. We also provide a
description of the block structure associated with this factorization. As a
simple illustration we reprove a formula of Bernardi enumerating spanning
forests of the hypercube, that is closely related to the graph of spanning
trees of a bouquet. Several combinatorial questions are left open, such as
giving a bijective interpretation of the results.
