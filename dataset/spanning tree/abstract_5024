We present new H-alpha imaging of all known dwarf irregular companions to NGC
6946: UGC 11583, KK 251, KK 252, KKR 55, KKR 56, Cepheus 1, KKR 59, and KKR 60.
The galaxies span a range of blue absolute magnitudes of [-13.6, -17.6],
relative gas content of [0.1, 2.5] M_sun/L_sun, current star formation activity
of [0.2, 5.2]10^-2 M_sun yr^-1, and timescale to exhaust the current gas supply
of [6, 86] Gyr.
