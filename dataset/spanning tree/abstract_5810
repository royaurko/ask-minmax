Contraction of an edge merges its end points into a new vertex which is
adjacent to each neighbor of the end points of the edge. An edge in a
$k$-connected graph is {\em contractible} if its contraction does not result in
a graph of lower connectivity. We characterize contractible edges in chordal
graphs using properties of tree decompositions with respect to minimal vertex
separators.
