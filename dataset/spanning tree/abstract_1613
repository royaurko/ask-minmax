We describe an algebraic approach to combinatorial connectivity. As an
application, we obtain canonical tree-decompositions distinguishing all the
maximal tangles of a finite graph or matroid. For graphs we also find such
decompositions which, for any given k, distinguish all their distinguishable
k-blocks and tangles of order k+1. If we only consider robust blocks and
tangles, we obtain one overall tree-decomposition which refines all these
tree-decompositions, for all k simultaneously.
