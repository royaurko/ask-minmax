These lectures describe some of the latest data on particle production in
high-energy collisions and compare them with theoretical calculations and
models based on QCD. The main topics covered are: fragmentation functions and
factorization, small-x fragmentation, hadronization models, differences between
quark and gluon fragmentation, current and target fragmentation in deep
inelastic scattering, and heavy quark fragmentation.
