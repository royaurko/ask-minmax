We will consider cross products of finite graphs with a class of trees that
have arbitrarily but finitely long line segments, such as the Fibonacci tree.
Such cross products are called tree-strips. We prove that for small disorder
random Schr\"odinger operators on such tree-strips have purely absolutely
continuous spectrum in a certain set.
