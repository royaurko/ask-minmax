In this paper, a new and novel data structure is proposed to dynamically
insert and delete segments. Unlike the standard segment trees[3], the proposed
data structure permits insertion of a segment with interval range beyond the
interval range of the existing tree, which is the interval between minimum and
maximum values of the end points of all the segments. Moreover, the number of
nodes in the proposed tree is lesser as compared to the dynamic version of the
standard segment trees, and is able to answer both stabbing and range queries
practically much faster compared to the standard segment trees.
