In the general MSSM, chirally-enhanced corrections (to Yukawa couplings) are
induced by gluino-squark, chargino-sfermion and neutralino-sfermion loops and
can numerically compete with, or even dominate over, tree-level contributions,
due to their chiral enhancement. In this article I review the resummation of
these corrections to all orders in pertubation theory based on recent work done
in collaboration with Lars Hofer and Janusz Rosiek (arXiv:1103.4272).
