We propose a simple generalization of the explosive percolation process
[Achlioptas et al., Science 323, 1453 (2009)], and investigate its structural
and transport properties. In this model, at each step, a set of q unoccupied
bonds is randomly chosen. Each of these bonds is then associated with a weight
given by the product of the cluster sizes that they would potentially connect,
and only that bond among the q-set which has the smallest weight becomes
occupied. Our results indicate that, at criticality, all finite-size scaling
exponents for the spanning cluster, the conducting backbone, the cutting bonds,
and the global conductance of the system, change continuously and significantly
with q. Surprisingly, we also observe that systems with intermediate values of
q display the worst conductive performance. This is explained by the strong
inhibition of loops in the spanning cluster, resulting in a substantially
smaller associated conducting backbone.
