We show that each of Thompson's groups F, T, and V have infinitely many ends
relative to certain subgroups. We go on to show that T and V both have Serre's
property FA, i.e., any action of T or V on a tree will have a fixed point. (The
proof of the latter statement was originally due to Ken Brown, and our proof is
based on his notes.)
