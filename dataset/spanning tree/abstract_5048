The effect of disorder on flux line lattice (FLL) melting is studied via the
Peak Effect phenomenon. On the upper branch of the Peak Effect curve, where
this effect is more robust, we observe a stepwise disordering of the FLL,
suggesting two first order transition spanning the Peak Effect region. The
lower part of the curve is found to be strongly affected by disorder. Both the
branch and the "nose", i.e., the turnaround of the curve, dissapear in systems
with stronger disorder and the observed results are consitent with the line
seperating a disentangled liquid or a glass from an entangled flux liquid.
