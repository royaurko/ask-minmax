The distribution of nearby (cz < 7500 km/s) galaxies has been explored by
minimal spanning trees; allowance has been made for the drastic decrease of
data with distance. The investigation finds that all galaxies are members of
irregular elongated large-scale structures; there are no `field galaxies'.
Based on our local large-scale structure, every galaxy appears to have a
neighbouring galaxy within <100 km/s (1.4 h_{70}^{-1} Mpc) of redshift space,
and thereby all galaxies are found to lie in filaments or tree configurations.
  Every large-scale structure appears to have a neighbouring large-scale
structure within <700 km/s (10 h_{70}^{-1} Mpc), such that large-scale
structures interconnect to form a continuous labyrinth.
