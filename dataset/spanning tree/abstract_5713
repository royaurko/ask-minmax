The technology required for eikonal scattering amplitude calculations in
Matrix theory is developed. Using the entire supersymmetric completion of the
v^4/r^7 Matrix theory potential we compute the graviton-graviton scattering
amplitude and find agreement with eleven dimensional supergravity at tree
level.
