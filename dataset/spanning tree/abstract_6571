This report addresses state inference for hidden Markov models. These models
rely on unobserved states, which often have a meaningful interpretation. This
makes it necessary to develop diagnostic tools for quantification of state
uncertainty. The entropy of the state sequence that explains an observed
sequence for a given hidden Markov chain model can be considered as the
canonical measure of state sequence uncertainty. This canonical measure of
state sequence uncertainty is not reflected by the classic multivariate state
profiles computed by the smoothing algorithm, which summarizes the possible
state sequences. Here, we introduce a new type of profiles which have the
following properties: (i) these profiles of conditional entropies are a
decomposition of the canonical measure of state sequence uncertainty along the
sequence and makes it possible to localize this uncertainty, (ii) these
profiles are univariate and thus remain easily interpretable on tree
structures. We show how to extend the smoothing algorithms for hidden Markov
chain and tree models to compute these entropy profiles efficiently.
