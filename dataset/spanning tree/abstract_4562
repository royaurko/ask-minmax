Part-based models with restrictive tree-structured interactions for the Human
Pose Estimation problem, leaves many part interactions unhandled. Two of the
most common and strong manifestations of such unhandled interactions are
self-occlusion among the parts and the confusion in the localization of the
non-adjacent symmetric parts. By handling the self-occlusion in a data
efficient manner, we improve the performance of the basic Mixture of Parts
model by a large margin, especially on uncommon poses. Through addressing the
confusion in the symmetric limb localization using a combination of two
complementing trees, we improve the performance on all the parts by atmost
doubling the running time. Finally, we show that the combination of the two
solutions improves the results. We report results that are equivalent to the
state-of-the-art on two standard datasets. Because of maintaining the
tree-structured interactions and only part-level modeling of the base Mixture
of Parts model, this is achieved in time that is much less than the best
performing part-based model.
