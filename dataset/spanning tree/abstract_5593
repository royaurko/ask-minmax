The holographic mutual information for the small separation of two circles
and two strips in 2+1 dimensional space-time is considered based on the known
exact minimal surfaces spanning the boundaries on AdS4. The results suggest a
universality for the leading term in the short-distance expansion of
holographic mutual information. A conjecture for a similar result for d > 2 is
also presented, as well as comments about the analogous expansion in conformal
field theory.
