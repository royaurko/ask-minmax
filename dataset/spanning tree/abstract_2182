Graph canonization is the problem of computing a unique representative, a
canon, from the isomorphism class of a given graph. This implies that two
graphs are isomorphic exactly if their canons are equal. We show that graphs of
bounded tree width can be canonized by logarithmic-space (logspace) algorithms.
This implies that the isomorphism problem for graphs of bounded tree width can
be decided in logspace. In the light of isomorphism for trees being hard for
the complexity class logspace, this makes the ubiquitous class of graphs of
bounded tree width one of the few classes of graphs for which the complexity of
the isomorphism problem has been exactly determined.
