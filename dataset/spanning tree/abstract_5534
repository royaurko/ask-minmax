We report on the electrical properties of current annealed graphene and few
layer graphene devices. It is observed that current annealing for several hours
results the n-type doping in the graphene layers. After current annealing Dirac
point start to shift toward positive gate voltage and saturate at some fixed
gate voltage. N-type conduction in current annealed graphene layers is caused
by the charge trapping in oxide layer during current annealing and recovery of
charge neutrality point with time span is understood due to the de-trapping of
charge with time.
