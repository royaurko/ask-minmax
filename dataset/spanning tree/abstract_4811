In this paper we study random partitions of 1,...n, where every cluster of
size j can be in any of w\_j possible internal states. The Gibbs (n,k,w)
distribution is obtained by sampling uniformly among such partitions with k
clusters. We provide conditions on the weight sequence w allowing construction
of a partition valued random process where at step k the state has the Gibbs
(n,k,w) distribution, so the partition is subject to irreversible fragmentation
as time evolves. For a particular one-parameter family of weight sequences
w\_j, the time-reversed process is the discrete Marcus-Lushnikov coalescent
process with affine collision rate K\_{i,j}=a+b(i+j) for some real numbers a
and b. Under further restrictions on a and b, the fragmentation process can be
realized by conditioning a Galton-Watson tree with suitable offspring
distribution to have n nodes, and cutting the edges of this tree by random
sampling of edges without replacement, to partition the tree into a collection
of subtrees. Suitable offspring distributions include the binomial, negative
binomial and Poisson distributions.
