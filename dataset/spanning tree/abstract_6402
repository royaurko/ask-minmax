We study the discovery potential of the flavor-changing neutral coupling
(FCNC) htc of the Higgs boson and the top quark through the rare tree-body
decay h -> Wbc at Muon colliders for a light Higgs boson with mass 114 < m_h <
145 GeV. This decay mode may compete with the SM background induced by the hWW
coupling in some models with a tree-level htc coupling and with models that
predict this coupling at the one-loop level in the range 10^{-2} - 10^{-1}. A
future muon collider could test the scalar FCNC decay t -> hc via Higgs decay h
-> t* c -> b W+ c down to values of the coupling g_{tc}=0.5 (that are
equivalent to BR(t -> hc) = 5 x 10^{-3}). The LHC could probe values of g_{tc}
one order of magnitude smaller, unless other processes beyond the SM appear
that through intense multi jet activity may clutter the t -> hc signal.
