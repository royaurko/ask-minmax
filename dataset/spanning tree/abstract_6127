Two-body scattering and other discreteness effects are unimportant in
cosmological gravitational clustering in most scenarios, since the dark matter
has a small particle mass. The collective field should determine evolution:
Two-body scattering in simulations violates the Poisson-Vlasov equations. We
test this in PM, P$^3$M, Tree, and NGPM codes, noting that a collisionless code
will preserve the one-dimensional character of plane wave collapse. We find
collisionality vanishing as the softening parameter approaches the mean
interparticle separation. Solutions for the problem are suggested, involving
greater computer power, PM-based nested grid codes, and a more conservative
approach to resolution claims.
