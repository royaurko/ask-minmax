We give a simple explanation why the stationary state of the 1D TASEP model
with open boundaries is related to the Catalan numbers. Our construction is
based on planar binary trees and provides a combinatorial solution of the
stationary state. We discuss the relation to Catalan tableaux approaches in an
appendix.
