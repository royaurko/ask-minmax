We prove several results about the complexity of the role colouring problem.
A role colouring of a graph $G$ is an assignment of colours to the vertices of
$G$ such that two vertices of the same colour have identical sets of colours in
their neighbourhoods. We show that the problem of finding a role colouring with
$1< k <n$ colours is NP-hard for planar graphs. We show that restricting the
problem to trees yields a polynomially solvable case, as long as $k$ is either
constant or has a constant difference with $n$, the number of vertices in the
tree. Finally, we prove that cographs are always $k$-role-colourable for
$1<k\leq n$ and construct such a colouring in polynomial time.
