At the distance of NGC 5128 (3.6 \pm 0.2 Mpc) it is possible to resolve
globular clusters with high resolution imaging from the ground, thus allowing
the globular cluster candidate selection primarily through their morphological
properties. I report the discovery of 71 globular clusters in NGC 5128 on VLT
UT1+FORS1 images, including the faintest members (Mv ~ -5) known to date in
this galaxy as well as 5 previously known clusters. U- and V-band photometry
has been measured for all the candidates and the luminosity function, spanning
-10.1<Mv<-4.9 and -9.3<Mu<-3.3, constructed. These are the deepest globular
cluster luminosity functions in an elliptical galaxy determined so far. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics show that the difference between the globular
cluster luminosity functions of NGC 5128 and the MW is not larger than the
difference between the ones of M31 and the MW. The (U-V)o color histogram shows
a bimodal distribution. For 23 globular clusters I obtained K-band images with
SOFI at the NTT in La Silla. Their positions in the (U-V) vs.(V-K) color-color
diagram indicate that they are indeed old globular clusters. Assuming that the
globular clusters in NGC 5128 span a similar age range as the ones in the Milky
Way and adopting a linear fit between the metallicity and (U-V)o color, the
metal-rich clusters peak at [Fe/H]=-0.6 dex and the metal-poor ones peak at
[Fe/H]=-1.7 dex.
