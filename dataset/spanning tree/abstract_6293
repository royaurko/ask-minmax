Significant progress has been made in the past year in developing new `MHV'
techniques for calculating multiparticle scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills
gauge theories. Most of the work so far has focussed on applications to Quantum
Chromodynamics, both at tree and one-loop level. We show how such techniques
can also be applied to abelian theories such as QED, by studying the simplest
tree-level multiparticle process, e^+e^- to n \gamma. We compare explicit
results for up to n=5 photons using both the Cachazo, Svrcek and Witten `MHV
rules' and the related Britto-Cachazo-Feng `recursion relation' approaches with
those using traditional spinor techniques.
