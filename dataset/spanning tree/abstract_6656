Covarion models of character evolution describe inhomogeneities in
substitution processes through time. In phylogenetics, such models are used to
describe changing functional constraints or selection regimes during the
evolution of biological sequences. In this work the identifiability of such
models for generic parameters on a known phylogenetic tree is established,
provided the number of covarion classes does not exceed the size of the
observable state space. `Generic parameters' as used here means all parameters
except possibly those in a set of measure zero within the parameter space.
Combined with earlier results, this implies both the tree and generic numerical
parameters are identifiable if the number of classes is strictly smaller than
the number of observable states.
