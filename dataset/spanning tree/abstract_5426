This note wants to explain how to obtain meaningful pictures of (possibly
high-dimensional) convex polytopes, triangulated manifolds, and other objects
from the realm of geometric combinatorics such as tight spans of finite metric
spaces and tropical polytopes. In all our cases we arrive at specific,
geometrically motivated, graph drawing problems. The methods displayed are
implemented in the software system polymake.
