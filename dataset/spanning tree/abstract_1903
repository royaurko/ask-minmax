In a recent study, Steel and Sanderson defined and characterized
phylogenetically decisive sets of taxon sets. A set is called phylogenetically
decisive if regardless of the trees chosen for each of its taxon sets, as long
as these trees are compatible with one another, their supertree is always
unique. This implies that the sampled taxon sets always lead to a unique
supertree, regardless what tree they support (as long as the trees of all the
taxon sets are compatible) -- which is why this setting can be referred to as
"perfect taxon sampling". However, the complexity of the decision problem to
determine whether a set of taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive remained
unknown. This problem was one of the "Penny Ante" prize questions of the Annual
New Zealand Phylogenetics Meeting in 2012. In this paper, we explain
phylogenetic decisiveness and demonstrate a new characterization, which then
leads to a polynomial time algorithm for the case where the number of taxon
sets under consideration is polynomial in the number of taxa - both for the
(simpler) rooted tree case as well as for the (more complicated) unrooted tree
case.
