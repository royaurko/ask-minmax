Rotation distance between rooted binary trees measures the number of simple
operations it takes to transform one tree into another. There are no known
polynomial-time algorithms for computing rotation distance. We give an
efficient, linear-time approximation algorithm, which estimates the rotation
distance, within a provable factor of 2, between ordered rooted binary trees. .
