Boosted decision trees are applied to particle identification in the
MiniBooNE experiment operated at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
(Fermilab) for neutrino oscillations. Numerous attempts are made to tune the
boosted decision trees, to compare performance of various boosting algorithms,
and to select input variables for optimal performance.
