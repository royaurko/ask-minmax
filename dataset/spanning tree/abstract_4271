We establish sufficient conditions for the C$^*$-simplicity of two classes of
groups. The first class is that of groups acting on trees, such as amalgamated
free products, HNN-extensions, and their normal subgroups; for example normal
subgroups of Baumslag-Solitar groups. The second class is that of fundamental
groups of compact 3-manifolds, related to the first class by their
Kneser-Milnor and JSJ-decompositions. Much of our analysis deals with
conditions on an action of a group $\Gamma$ on a tree $T$ which imply the
following three properties: abundance of hyperbolic elements, better called
strong hyperbolicity, minimality, both on the tree $T$ and on its boundary
$\partial T$, and faithfulness in a strong sense. An important step in this
analysis is to identify automorphism of $T$ which are \emph{slender}, namely
such that their fixed-point sets in $\partial T$ are nowhere dense for the
shadow topology.
