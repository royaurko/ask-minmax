We have derived the unitarity bounds in the high energy limit for the minimal
B-L extension of the Standard Model by analysing the full class of Higgs and
would-be Goldstone boson two-to-two scatterings at tree level. Moreover, we
have investigated how these limits could vary at some lower critical value of
the energy.
