Feynman rules for the Standard Model including non-linear gauges are derived
and implemented in the FeynArts package. The calculations using FeynArts with
the new rules show that tree-level amplitudes are gauge invariant and that
renormalization is not spoiled for one-loop calculations. The FeynArts model
files are available at http://www.fi.lt/~garfield/SM/
