By an omega_1 --tree we mean a tree of size omega_1 and height omega_1. An
omega_1 --tree is called a Kurepa tree if all its levels are countable and it
has more than omega_1 branches. An omega_1 --tree is called a Jech--Kunen tree
if it has kappa branches for some kappa strictly between omega_1 and
2^{omega_1}. A Kurepa tree is called an essential Kurepa tree if it contains
no Jech--Kunen subtrees. A Jech--Kunen tree is called an essential Jech--Kunen
tree if it contains no Kurepa subtrees. In this paper we prove that (1) it is
consistent with CH and 2^{omega_1}> omega_2 that there exist essential Kurepa
trees and there are no essential Jech--Kunen trees, (2) it is consistent with
CH and 2^{omega_1}> omega_2 plus the existence of a Kurepa tree with
2^{omega_1} branches that there exist essential Jech--Kunen trees and there
are no essential Kurepa trees. In the second result we require the existence
of a Kurepa tree with 2^{omega_1} branches in order to avoid triviality.
