We study a new class of time inhomogeneous P\'olya-type urn schemes and give
optimal rates of convergence for the distribution of the number of balls of a
given color (properly scaled) to nearly the full class of generalized gamma
distributions with integer parameters, a class which includes the Rayleigh,
half-normal, Weibull and gamma distributions. Our main tool is a new approach
for generalized gamma approximation via Stein's method, which relies on
characterizing these distributions as unique fixed points of certain
distributional transformations reminiscent of the equilibrium distributional
transformation from renewal theory. We then identify some special cases of
these urn models in recursive constructions of random walk paths and trees
which yields rates of convergence for local time and height statistics of
simple random walk paths as well as for the size of random subtrees of
uniformly random binary and plane trees.
