Recent evidence indicates that the Universe is open, i.e., spatially
hyperbolic, longstanding theoretical preferences to the contrary
notwithstanding. This makes it possible to select a vacuum state, Fock space,
and particle definition for a quantized field, by requiring concordance with
ordinary flat-spacetime theory at late times. The particle-number basis states
thus identified span the physical state space of the field at all times. This
construction is demonstrated here explicitly for a massive, minimally coupled,
linear scalar field in an open, radiation-dominated Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
spacetime.
