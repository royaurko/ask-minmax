We recall the occupancy problem introduced by Konheim & Weiss in 1966 and we
consider parking functions as hash maps. Each car $c_i$ prefers parking space
$p_i$ (the hash map $c_i \mapsto p_i$ with $c_i$ is a key and $p_i$ an index
into an array), if $p_i$ is occupied then $c_i$ the next available parking
space (the hash table implementation using an open addressing strategy). This
paper considers some others hash table implementations like hash tables with
linked lists (with parking functions as hash maps). Using the Species Theory,
we enumerate by Lagrange inversion those hash tables structures via a bijection
with tree-like structures. This bijection provides a generalization of the
Foata-Riordan bijection between parking functions and (forests of) rooted
trees. Finally we show the number of hash tables with linked lists on a set of
keys of cardinality $n$ is $n!C_n$, so the number of labeled binary trees with
$n$ nodes.
