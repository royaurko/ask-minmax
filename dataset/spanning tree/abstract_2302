We give an explicit description of the free objects in the quasivariety of
adequate semigroups, as sets of labelled directed trees under a natural
combinatorial multiplication. The morphisms of the free adequate semigroup onto
the free ample semigroup and into the free inverse semigroup are realised by a
combinatorial "folding" operation which transforms our trees into Munn trees.
We use these results to show that free adequate semigroups and monoids are
J-trivial and never finitely generated as semigroups, and that those which are
finitely generated as (2,1,1)-algebras have decidable word problem.
