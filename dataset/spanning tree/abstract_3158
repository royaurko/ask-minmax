The number of stable sets of cardinality $k$ in graph $G$ is the $k$-th
coefficient of the independence polynomial of $G$ (I. Gutman and F. Harary,
1983). In 1990, Y. O. Hamidoune proved that for any claw-free graph, its
independence polynomial is unimodal, i.e., there exists a coefficient $k$ such
that the part of the sequence of coefficients from the first to $k$-th is
non-decreasing while the second part of coefficients is non-increasing.
  Y. Alavi, P. J. Malde, A. J. Schwenk and P. Erd\"{o}s (1987) asked whether
for trees (or perhaps forests) the independence polynomial is unimodal. J. I.
Brown, K. Dilcher and R. J. Nowakowski (2000) conjectured that it is true for
any well-covered graph (a graph whose all maximal independent sets have the
same size). V. E. Levit and E. Mandrescu (1999) demonstrated that every
well-covered tree can be obtained as a join of a number of well-covered
spiders, where a spider is a tree having at most one vertex of degree at least
three.
  In this paper we show that the independence polynomial of any well-covered
spider is unimodal. In addition, we introduce some graph transformations
respecting independence polynomials. They allow us to reduce several types of
well-covered trees to claw-free graphs, and, consequently, to prove that their
independence polynomials are unimodal.
