In this paper we consider tiling $\{p, q \}$ of the Euclidean space and of
the hyperbolic space, and its dual graph $\Gamma_{q, p}$ from a combinatorial
point of view. A substitution $\sigma_{q, p}$ on an appropriate finite alphabet
is constructed. The homogeneity of graph $\Gamma_{q, p}$ and its generation
function are the basic tools for the construction. The tree associated with
substitution $\sigma_{q, p}$ is a spanning tree of graph $\Gamma_{q, p}$. Let
$u_n$ be the number of tiles of tiling $\{p, q \}$ of generation $n$. The
characteristic polynomial of the transition matrix of substitution $\sigma_{q,
p}$ is a characteristic polynomial of a linear recurrence. The sequence
$(u_n)_{n \geq 0}$ is a solution of this recurrence. The growth of sequence
$(u_n)_{n \geq 0}$ is given by the dominant root of the characteristic
polynomial.
