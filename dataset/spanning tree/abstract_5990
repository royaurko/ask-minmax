Recently, Johansson and Ochirov conjectured the form of a new colour
decomposition for QCD tree-level amplitudes. This note provides a proof of that
conjecture. The proof is based on "Mario World" Feynman diagrams, which exhibit
the hierarchical Dyck structure previously found to be very useful when dealing
with multi-quark amplitudes.
