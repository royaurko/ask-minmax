We consider branching processes with interaction in continuous time, both
with values in the integers and in the reals (in the second case we restrict
ourselves to continuous processes), which model the evolution of the size of a
population. We assume that for large population size the interaction is of the
type of a competition, which limits the size of the population. We discuss in
which cases the interaction is strong enough so that the extinction time (or
equivalently the height of the forest of genealogical trees) remains finite, as
the number of ancestors tends to infinity, or even such that the length of the
forest of genealogical trees (which in the case of continuous state is rather
called its total mass) remains finite, as the ancestral population size tends
to infinity.
