We show that the cophylogenetic distance, k-interval cospeciation, is
distinct from other metrics and accounts for global congruence between locally
incongruent trees. The growth of the neighborhood of trees which satisfy the
largest possible k-interval cospeciation with a given tree indicates that
k-interval cospeciation is useful for analyzing simulated data.
