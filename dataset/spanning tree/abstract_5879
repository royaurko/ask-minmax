A signless Laplacian eigenvalue of a graph $G$ is called a main signless
Laplacian eigenvalue if it has an eigenvector the sum of whose entries is not
equal to zero. In this paper, we first give the necessary and sufficient
conditions for a graph with one main signless Laplacian eigenvalue or two main
signless Laplacian eigenvalues, and then characterize the trees and unicyclic
graphs with exactly two main signless Laplacian eigenvalues, respectively.
