In this paper we use Heegaard Floer link homology to determine the dual
Thurston polytope for pretzel links of the form P(-2r_1-1, 2q_1, -2q_2, 2r_2+1)
where r_i and q_i are positive integers. We apply this result to determine the
Thurston norms of spanning surfaces for the individual link components, and we
explicitly construct norm-realizing examples of such surfaces.
