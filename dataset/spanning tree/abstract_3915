Constraint automata are an adaptation of B\"uchi-automata that process data
words where the data comes from some relational structure S. Every transition
of such an automaton comes with constraints in terms of the relations of S. A
transition can only be fired if the current and the next data values satisfy
all constraints of this transition. These automata have been used in the
setting where S is a linear order for deciding constraint LTL with constraints
over S. In this paper, S is the infinitely branching infinite order tree T. We
provide a PSPACE algorithm for emptiness of T-constraint automata. This result
implies PSPACE-completeness of the satisfiability and the model checking
problem for constraint LTL with constraints over T.
