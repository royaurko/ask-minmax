Sparse coding consists in representing signals as sparse linear combinations
of atoms selected from a dictionary. We consider an extension of this framework
where the atoms are further assumed to be embedded in a tree. This is achieved
using a recently introduced tree-structured sparse regularization norm, which
has proven useful in several applications. This norm leads to regularized
problems that are difficult to optimize, and we propose in this paper efficient
algorithms for solving them. More precisely, we show that the proximal operator
associated with this norm is computable exactly via a dual approach that can be
viewed as the composition of elementary proximal operators. Our procedure has a
complexity linear, or close to linear, in the number of atoms, and allows the
use of accelerated gradient techniques to solve the tree-structured sparse
approximation problem at the same computational cost as traditional ones using
the L1-norm. Our method is efficient and scales gracefully to millions of
variables, which we illustrate in two types of applications: first, we consider
fixed hierarchical dictionaries of wavelets to denoise natural images. Then, we
apply our optimization tools in the context of dictionary learning, where
learned dictionary elements naturally organize in a prespecified arborescent
structure, leading to a better performance in reconstruction of natural image
patches. When applied to text documents, our method learns hierarchies of
topics, thus providing a competitive alternative to probabilistic topic models.
