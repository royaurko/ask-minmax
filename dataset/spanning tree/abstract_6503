Within the framework of QCD factorization (QCDF), power corrections due to
penguin annihilation can account for theobserved rates of penguin-dominated
two-body decays of $B$ mesons and direct CP asymmetries $A_{CP}(K^-\pi^+)$,
$A_{CP}((K^{*-}\pi^+)$, $A_{CP}((K^-\rho^0)$ and $A_{CP}((\pi^+\pi^-)$.
However, the predicted direct CP-violating effects in QCDF for $B^-\to
K^-\pi^0,K^-\eta,\pi^-\eta$ and $\bar B^0\to\pi^0\pi^0$ are wrong in signs when
confronted with experiment. We consider two different types of power correction
effects in order to resolve the CP puzzles and rate deficit problems with
penguin-dominated two-body decays of $B$ mesons and color-suppressed
tree-dominated $\pi^0\pi^0$ and $\rho^0\pi^0$ modes: penguin annihilation and
soft corrections to the color-suppressed tree amplitude.
