We study the evolution of branching trees embedded in Euclidean spaces with
suppressed branching of spatially close nodes. This cooperative branching
process accounts for the effect of overcrowding of nodes in the embedding space
and mimics the evolution of life processes (the so-called "tree of life") in
which a new level of complexity emerges as a short transition followed by a
long period of gradual evolution or even complete extinction. We consider the
models of branching trees in which each new node can produce up to two twigs
within a unit distance from the node in the Euclidean space, but this branching
is suppressed if the newborn node is closer than at distance $a$ from one of
the previous generation nodes. This results in an explosive (exponential)
growth in the initial period, and, after some crossover time $t_x \sim
\ln(1/a)$ for small $a$, in a slow (power-law) growth. This special point is
also a transition from "small" to "large words" in terms of network science. We
show that if the space is restricted, then this evolution may end by
extinction.
