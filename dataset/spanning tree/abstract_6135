Within the context of the standard structure formation scenario, massive
present day elliptical galaxies are sometimes thought of as the result of a
major merger of spiral systems. Through extensive SPH simulations of merging
spirals, we have explored these processes with the aim of quantifying their
relaxation times. This is important, as it sets a minimum time interval between
the onset of a merger, and the appearance of an elliptical galaxy. We then
compare this constraint with predictions of the hierarchical scenario, computed
through Press-Schechter merger trees. We find evidence for elliptical systems
which appear not to have been formed by a major merger of spirals.
