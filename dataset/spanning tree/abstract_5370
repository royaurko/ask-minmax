For a set of quasi-exponentials with real exponents, we consider the discrete
Wronskian (also known as Casorati determinant) with pure imaginary step 2h. We
prove that if the coefficients of the discrete Wronskian are real and for every
its roots the imaginary part is at most |h|, then the complex span of this set
of quasi-exponentials has a basis consisting of quasi-exponentials with real
coefficients. This result is a generalization of the statement of the B. and M.
Shapiro conjecture on spaces of polynomials. The proof is based on the Bethe
ansatz for the XXX model.
