An out-tree $T$ is an oriented tree with only one vertex of in-degree zero. A
vertex $x$ of $T$ is internal if its out-degree is positive. We design
randomized and deterministic algorithms for deciding whether an input digraph
contains a given out-tree with $k$ vertices. The algorithms are of runtime
$O^*(5.704^k)$ and $O^*(5.704^{k(1+o(1))})$, respectively. We apply the
deterministic algorithm to obtain a deterministic algorithm of runtime
$O^*(c^k)$, where $c$ is a constant, for deciding whether an input digraph
contains a spanning out-tree with at least $k$ internal vertices. This answers
in affirmative a question of Gutin, Razgon and Kim (Proc. AAIM'08).
