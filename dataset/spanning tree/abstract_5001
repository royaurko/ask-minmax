This work presents the structural decomposition of a sample of 11 disk
galaxies, which span a range of different morphological types.
  The U, B, V, R, and I photometric information given in Paper I (color and
color-index images and luminosity, ellipticity, and position-angle profiles)
has been used to decide what types of components form the galaxies before
carrying out the decomposition. We find and model such components as bulges,
disks, bars, lenses and rings.
