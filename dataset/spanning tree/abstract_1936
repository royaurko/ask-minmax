The paper is devoted to a study of certain fixed point properties, and their
relatives, in the context of full automorphism groups of countable rooted
trees. Namely, we study Serre's property (FA'), also called unsplittability,
property (FA), the uncountable strong cofinality, and ample generics.
  We give a new proof of a theorem of Psaltis to the extent that automorphism
groups of rooted trees are unsplittable, and show under what circumstances
automorphism groups of rooted trees have uncountable strong cofinality (and
thus property (FA).) Also, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for
automorphism groups of rooted trees to have ample generics. This very strong
property has interesting implications, such as the small index property, and
continuity of homomorphisms.
  As an application, we analyze the relationship between two generalizations
(discovered by Psaltis and Forester) of an interesting rigidity result on
locally finite trees, originally proved by Bass and Lubotzky.
