In this paper we deal with verification of safety properties of parameterized
systems with a tree topology. The verification problem is translated to a
purely logical problem of finding a finite countermodel for a first-order
formula, which further resolved by a generic finite model finding procedure. A
finite countermodel method is shown is at least as powerful as regular tree
model checking and as the methods based on monotonic abstraction and backwards
symbolic reachability. The practical efficiency of the method is illustrated on
a set of examples taken from the literature.
