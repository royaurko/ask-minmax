We prove the complete monotonicity on $(0,\infty)^n$ for suitable inverse
powers of the spanning-tree polynomials of graphs and, more generally, of the
basis generating polynomials of certain classes of matroids. This generalizes a
result of Szego and answers, among other things, a long-standing question of
Lewy and Askey concerning the positivity of Taylor coefficients for certain
rational functions. Our proofs are based on two_ab initio_ methods for proving
that $P^{-\beta}$ is completely monotone on a convex cone $C$: the
determinantal method and the quadratic-form method. These methods are closely
connected with harmonic analysis on Euclidean Jordan algebras (or equivalently
on symmetric cones). We furthermore have a variety of constructions that, given
such polynomials, can create other ones with the same property: among these are
algebraic analogues of the matroid operations of deletion, contraction, direct
sum, parallel connection, series connection and 2-sum. The complete
monotonicity of $P^{-\beta}$ for some $\beta > 0$ can be viewed as a strong
quantitative version of the half-plane property (Hurwitz stability) for $P$,
and is also related to the Rayleigh property for matroids.
