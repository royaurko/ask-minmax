Various feature descriptions are being employed in logic programming
languages and constrained-based grammar formalisms. The common notational
primitive of these descriptions are functional attributes called features. The
descriptions considered in this paper are the possibly quantified first-order
formulae obtained from a signature of binary and unary predicates called
features and sorts, respectively. We establish a first-order theory FT by means
of three axiom schemes, show its completeness, and construct three elementarily
equivalent models. One of the models consists of so-called feature graphs, a
data structure common in computational linguistics. The other two models
consist of so-called feature trees, a record-like data structure generalizing
the trees corresponding to first-order terms. Our completeness proof exhibits a
terminating simplification system deciding validity and satisfiability of
possibly quantified feature descriptions.
