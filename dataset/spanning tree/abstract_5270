A method of classification of integrable equations on quad-graphs is
discussed based on algebraic ideas. We assign a Lie ring to the equation and
study the function describing the dimensions of linear spaces spanned by
multiple commutators of the ring generators. For the generic case this function
grows exponentially. Examples show that for integrable equations it grows
slower. We propose a classification scheme based on this observation.
