In this paper, we propose a new construction of constantdegree expanders
motivated by their application in P2P overlay networks and in particular in the
design of robust trees overlay. Our key result can be stated as follows.
Consider a complete binary tree T and construct a random pairing {\Pi} between
leaf nodes and internal nodes. We prove that the graph G\Pi obtained from T by
contracting all pairs (leaf-internal nodes) achieves a constant node expansion
with high probability. The use of our result in improving the robustness of
tree overlays is straightforward. That is, if each physical node participating
to the overlay manages a random pair that couples one virtual internal node and
one virtual leaf node then the physical-node layer exhibits a constant
expansion with high probability. We encompass the difficulty of obtaining this
random tree virtualization by proposing a local, selforganizing and churn
resilient uniformly-random pairing algorithm with O(log2 n) running time. Our
algorithm has the merit to not modify the original tree virtual overlay (we
just control the mapping between physical nodes and virtual nodes). Therefore,
our scheme is general and can be applied to a large number of tree overlay
implementations. We validate its performances in dynamic environments via
extensive simulations.
