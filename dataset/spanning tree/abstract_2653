The task of comparing the Hausdorff spectrum, the computational spectrum, and
the Legendre spectrum of a fractal set endowed with a probability measure, was
tackled by several contributors - Cawley and Mauldin, Riedi and Mandelbrot, among
others. For self-similar measures all three spectra coincide. We compare these
spectra for the hyperbolic measure (inducing the Farey Tree partition),
fundamentally different from the self-similar one.
