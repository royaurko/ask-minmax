The recent precision electroweak data on $\Gamma^l, \bar s^2_W$ and $M_W/M_Z$
are compared with the tree-level and the dominant-fermion-loop as well as the
full one-loop standard-model predictions. While the tree-level predictions are
ruled out, the dominant-fermion-loop predictions, defined by using $\alpha
(M^2_Z)\cong 1/128.9$ in the tree-level formulae, as well as the full one-loop
predictions are consistent with the experimental data. Deviations from the
dominant-fermion-loop predictions are quantified in terms of an effective
Lagrangian containing three additional parameters which have a simple meaning
in terms of $SU(2)$ symmetry violation. The effective Lagrangian yields the
standard one-loop predictions for specific values of these parameters, which
are determined by $m_t$ and $m_H$.
