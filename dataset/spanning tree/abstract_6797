An associahedron is a polytope whose vertices correspond to triangulations of
a convex polygon and whose edges correspond to flips between them. Using
labeled polygons, C. Hohlweg and C. Lange constructed various realizations of
the associahedron with relevant properties related to the symmetric group and
the classical permutahedron. We introduce the spine of a triangulation as its
dual tree together with a labeling and an orientation. This notion extends the
classical understanding of the associahedron via binary trees, introduces a new
perspective on C. Hohlweg and C. Lange's construction closer to J.-L. Loday's
original approach, and sheds light upon the combinatorial and geometric
properties of the resulting realizations of the associahedron. It also leads to
noteworthy proofs which shorten and simplify previous approaches.
