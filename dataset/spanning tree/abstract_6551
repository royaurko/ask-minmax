An (h,s,t)-representation of a graph G consists of a collection of subtrees
of a tree T, where each subtree corresponds to a vertex of G such that (i) the
maximum degree of T is at most h, (ii) every subtree has maximum degree at mots
s, (iii) there is an edge between two vertices in the graph G if and only if
the corresponding subtrees have at least t vertices in common in T. The class
of graphs that have an (h,s,t)-representation is denoted [h,s,t].
  An undirected graph G is called a VPT graph if it is the vertex intersection
graph of a family of paths in a tree. In this paper we characterize [h,2,1]
graphs using chromatic number. We show that the problem of deciding whether a
given VPT graph belongs to [h,2,1] is NP-complete, while the problem of
deciding whether the graph belongs to [h,2,1]-[h-1,2,1] is NP-hard. Both
problems remain hard even when restricted to $Split \cap VPT$. Additionally, we
present a non-trivial subclass of $Split \cap VPT$ in which these problems are
polynomial time solvable.
