We report new estimates for the lower mass function of 5 young open clusters
spanning an age range from 80 to 150 Myr. In all studied clusters, the mass
function across the stellar/substellar boundary (~0.072 Mo) and up to 0.4 Mo is
consistent with a power-law with an exponent alpha of -0.5 +/- 0.1, i.e., dN/dM
~ M**(-0.5).
