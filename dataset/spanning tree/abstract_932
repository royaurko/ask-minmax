Range trees are multidimensional binary trees which are used to perform
d-dimensional orthogonal range searching. In this technical report we study the
implementation issues of range trees with fractional cascading, named layered
range trees. We also document our implementation of range trees with fractional
cascading in C++ using STL and generic programming techniques.
