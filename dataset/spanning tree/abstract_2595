I have performed experimental measurements of acoustic emission signals
resulting from the drying process of Phyllostachys Pubescens bamboo. The
emphasis was on identifying individual events, and characterize them according
to their time span and energy release. My results show a histogram of
experimental squared voltage distributions nicely fit into a power law with
exponent of $-1.16$, reminiscent of scale free phenomena. I have also
calculated the average signal shape, for different time spans of the system,
and found an asymmetrical form. The experimental evidence points to the system
having an isolated large crack at the beginning of the simulation.
