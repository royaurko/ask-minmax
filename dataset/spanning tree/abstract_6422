The BaBar Collaboration has pointed out that $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0$ is
dominated by an isospin-zero final state, leading to nearly complete depletion
of the Dalitz plot along all three diagonals. In flavor-SU(3) approaches to
charmed particle decays to a light vector and a light pseudoscalar particle,
this behavior is seen, but does not appear to have a fundamental origin.
Instead, it arises as a result of approximate cancellation of higher-isospin
combinations of several types of amplitudes: color-favored tree,
color-suppressed tree, and exchange. Interpretation in terms of a
direct-channel effect would require an exotic resonance, with spin, parity, and
charge-congjugation eigenvalues $J^{PC} = 0^{--}$.
