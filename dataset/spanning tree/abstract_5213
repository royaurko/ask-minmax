We report on the photophysics of a phenyl-substituted PPV both in solution
and as a film. For both systems we have studied the decay of the
photoluminescence and of the emission anisotropy for a large set of wavelengths
spanning the entire photoluminescence spectrum. At long wavelengths the decay
behavior is that of an interchain species. At the shortest wavelengths the
decay of the photoluminescence from the film is observed to have a long-lived
component, in addition to the rapidly decaying component usually associated
with energy transfer. We attribute this slow component to emission by isolated
intrachain excitons with reduced nonradiative relaxation.
