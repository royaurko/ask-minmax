We generalise Delhomm\'e's result that each tree-automatic ordinal is
strictly below \omega^\omega^\omega{} by showing that any tree-automatic linear
ordering has FC-rank strictly below \omega^\omega. We further investigate a
restricted form of tree-automaticity and prove that every linear ordering which
admits a tree-automatic presentation of branching complexity at most k has
FC-rank strictly below \omega^k.
