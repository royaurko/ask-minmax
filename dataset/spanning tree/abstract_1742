We consider the creation conditions of diverse hierarchical trees both
analytically and numerically. A connection between the probabilities to create
hierarchical levels and the probability to associate these levels into a united
structure is studied. We argue that a consistent probabilistic picture requires
the use of deformed algebra. Our consideration is based on the study of the
main types of hierarchical trees, among which both regular and degenerate ones
are studied analytically, while the creation probabilities of Fibonacci,
scale-free and arbitrary trees are determined numerically.
