We present theoretical delay times and rates of thermonuclear explosions that
are thought to produce Type Ia supernovae, including the double-detonation
sub-Chandrasekhar mass model, using the population synthesis binary evolution
code StarTrack. If detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white
dwarfs following a detonation in an accumulated layer of helium on the white
dwarf's surface ("double-detonation" models) are able to produce thermonuclear
explosions which are characteristically similar to those of SNe Ia, then these
sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions may account for at least some substantial
fraction of the observed SN Ia rate. Regardless of whether all
double-detonations look like 'normal' SNe Ia, in any case the explosions are
expected to be bright and thus potentially detectable. Additionally, we find
that the delay time distribution of double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar mass
SNe Ia can be divided into two distinct formation channels: the 'prompt'
helium-star channel with delay times <500 Myr (~10% of all sub-Chandras), and
the 'delayed' double white dwarf channel, with delay times >800 Myr spanning up
to a Hubble time (~90%). These findings coincide with recent
observationally-derived delay time distributions which have revealed that a
large number of SNe Ia are prompt with delay times <500 Myr, while a
significant fraction also have delay times spanning ~1 Gyr to a Hubble time.
