We are looking at quasar environment in the context of large-scale structure
(LSS) - a new approach, giving a more informed interpretation of quasar-galaxy
correlations. This paper presents our first results for a sample of z ~ 0.3
quasars. We are using Voronoi tessellation applied in colour (B_J - R) slices
for the detection of galaxy clusters and the minimal spanning tree (MST) to
delineate the large-scale structure. This new cluster-detection method allows
us to find reliably galaxy clusters at z < 0.3 from SuperCOSMOS measurements of
UK Schmidt plates. By reconstructing the large-scale structure in a relatively
narrow redshift band (0.2 < z < 0.3), we show that quasars follow the
large-scale structure traced by galaxy clusters. None of the quasars in our
radio-quiet sample is located in the central area of a galaxy cluster. Two
quasars, found in a very rich environment, are actually located between two
very close galaxy clusters, consistent with results on z ~ 1 quasars suggesting
that cluster merg ers may be involved in one of the quasar formation
mechanisms.
