A reformulation of the path length of binary search trees is given in terms
of permutations, allowing to extend the definition to the instance of words,
where the letters are obtained by independent geometric random variables (with
parameter q). In this way, expressions for expectation and variance are
obtained which in the limit for $q\to1$ are the classical expressions.
