We present results on the chiral and deconfinement properties of the QCD
transition at finite temperature. Calculations are performed with 2+1 flavors
of quarks using the p4, asqtad and HISQ/tree actions. Lattices with temporal
extent N_tau=6, 8 and 12 are used to understand and control discretization
errors and to reliably extrapolate estimates obtained at finite lattice
spacings to the continuum limit. The chiral transition temperature is defined
in terms of the phase transition in a theory with two massless flavors and
analyzed using O(N) scaling fits to the chiral condensate and susceptibility.
We find consistent estimates from the HISQ/tree and asqtad actions and our main
result is T_c=154 +/- 9 MeV.
