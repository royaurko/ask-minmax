The GREM-like trap model is a continuous time Markov jump process on the
leaves of a finite volume $L$-level tree whose transition rates depend on a
trapping landscape built on the vertices of the whole tree. We prove that the
natural two-time correlation function of the dynamics ages in the infinite
volume limit and identify the limiting function. Moreover, we take the limit
$L\to\infty$ of the two-time correlation function of the infinite volume
$L$-level tree. The aging behavior of the dynamics is characterized by a
collection of clock processes, one for each level of the tree. We show that for
any $L$, the joint law of the clock processes converges. Furthermore, any such
limit can be expressed through Neveu's continuous state branching process.
Hence, the latter contains all the information needed to describe aging in the
GREM-like trap model both for finite and infinite levels.
