The cophenetic metrics $d_{\varphi,p}$, for $p\in {0}\cup[1,\infty[$, are a
recent addition to the kit of available distances for the comparison of
phylogenetic trees. Based on a fifty years old idea of Sokal and Rohlf, these
metrics compare phylogenetic trees on a same set of taxa by encoding them by
means of their vectors of cophenetic values of pairs of taxa and depths of
single taxa, and then computing the $L^p$ norm of the difference of the
corresponding vectors. In this paper we compute the expected value of the
square of $d_{\varphi,2}$ on the space of fully resolved rooted phylogenetic
trees with $n$ leaves, under the Yule and the uniform probability
distributions.
