In a model with a gauge group $G_{SM}\otimes U(1)_X$, where $G_{SM} \equiv
SU(3)_C \otimes SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$ is the standard model gauge group and
$U(1)_X$ is a horizontal local gauge symmetry, the spectrum of charged fermion
masses and mixing angles are obtained from radiative contributions with the aim
to reproduce the fermion masses and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix with
no {\it a priori} texture assumption. The assignment of horizontal charges is
made such that at tree level only the third family becomes massive when
electroweak symmetry is broken. Using these tree level masses and introducing
exotic scalars, the light families of charged fermions acquire hierarchical
masses through radiative corrections. The rank three mass matrices obtained are
written in terms of a minimal set of free parameters in order to estimate their
values by a numerical fit performance.
 The resulting masses and CKM mixing angles turn out to be in good agreement
with the known values.
  The new exotic scalar fields mediate flavor changing processes and contribute
to the anomalous magnetic moments of fermions, additionaly branching ratios an$
magnetic moments contributions were evaluated for leptons.
