Diffusion limited aggregation is studied from the perspective of
computational complexity. A parallel algorithm is exhibited that requires a
number of steps that scales as the depth of the tree defined by the cluster.
The existence of this algorithm suggests a connection between a fundamental
computational and structural property of DLA.
