We report on conductance fluctuations which are observed in local and
non-local magnetotransport experiments. Although the Hall bar samples are of
macroscopic size, the amplitude of the fluctuations from the local measurements
is close to e^2/h. It is shown that the fluctuations have to be attributed to
edge channel effects.
