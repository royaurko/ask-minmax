Hereditary chip-firing models generalize the Abelian sandpile model and the
cluster firing model to an exponential family of games induced by covers of the
vertex set. This generalization retains some desirable properties, e.g.
stabilization is independent of firings chosen and each chip-firing equivalence
class contains a unique recurrent configuration. In this paper we present an
explicit bijection between the recurrent configurations of a hereditary
chip-firing model on a graph and its spanning trees.
