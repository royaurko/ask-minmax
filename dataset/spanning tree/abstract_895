For which values of $k$ does a uniformly chosen $3$-regular graph $G$ on $n$
vertices typically contain $ n/k$ vertex-disjoint $k$-cycles (a $k$-cycle
factor)? To date, this has been answered for $k=n$ and for $k \ll \log n$; the
former, the Hamiltonicity problem, was finally answered in the affirmative by
Robinson and Wormald in 1992, while the answer in the latter case is negative
since with high probability most vertices do not lie on $k$-cycles.
  Here we settle the problem completely: the threshold for a $k$-cycle factor
in $G$ as above is $\kappa_0 \log_2 n$ with $\kappa_0=[1-\frac12\log_2
3]^{-1}\approx 4.82$. Precisely, we prove a 2-point concentration result: if $k
\geq \kappa_0 \log_2(2n/e)$ divides $n$ then $G$ contains a $k$-cycle factor
w.h.p., whereas if $k<\kappa_0\log_2(2n/e)-\frac{\log^2 n}n$ then w.h.p. it
does not. As a byproduct, we confirm the "Comb Conjecture," an old problem
concerning the embedding of certain spanning trees in the random graph
$G(n,p)$.
  The proof follows the small subgraph conditioning framework, but the
associated second moment analysis here is far more delicate than in any earlier
use of this method and involves several novel features, among them a sharp
estimate for tail probabilities in renewal processes without replacement which
may be of independent interest.
