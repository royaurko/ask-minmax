The classical matrix tree theorem relates the number of spanning trees of a
connected graph with the product of the nonzero eigenvalues of its Laplacian
matrix. The class of regular matroids generalizes that of graphical matroids,
and a generalization of the matrix tree theorem holds for this wider class.
  We give a new, geometric proof of this fact by showing via a
dissect-and-rearrange argument that two combinatorially distinct zonotopes
associated to a regular matroid have the same volume. Along the way we prove
that for a regular oriented matroid represented by a unimodular matrix, the
lattice spanned by its cocircuits coincides with the lattice spanned by the
rows of the representation matrix.
  Finally, by extending our setup to the weighted case we give new proofs of
recent results of An et al. on weighted graphs, and extend them to cover
regular matroids.
  No use is made of the Cauchy-Binet Theorem nor divisor theory on graphs.
