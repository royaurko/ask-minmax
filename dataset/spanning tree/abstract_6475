We present a simple and elementary procedure to sketch the tropical conic
given by a degree--two homogeneous tropical polynomial. These conics are trees
of a very particular kind. Given such a tree, we explain how to compute a
defining polynomial.
  Finally, we characterize those degree--two tropical polynomials which are
reducible and factorize them. We show that there exist irreducible degree--two
tropical polynomials giving rise to pairs of tropical lines.
