In "On the super edge graceful trees of even orders," Chung, Lee, Gao, and
Schaffer posed the following problem: Characterize trees of diameter 4 which
are super edge-graceful. In this paper, we provide super edge-graceful
labelings for all caterpillars and even size lobsters of diameter 4 which
permit such labelings. We also provide super edge-graceful labelings for
several families of odd size lobsters of diameter 4.
