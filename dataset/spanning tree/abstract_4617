Let H be a separable, infinite dimensional Hilbert space and let S be a
countable subset of H. Then most positive operators on H have the property that
every nonzero vector in the span of S is cyclic, in the sense that the set of
operators in the positive part of the unit ball of B(H) with this property is
comeager for the strong operator topology.
  Suppose \kappa is a regular cardinal such that \kappa \geq \omega_1 and
2^{<\kappa} = \kappa. Then it is relatively consistent with ZFC that 2^\omega =
\kappa and for any subset S \subset H of cardinality less than \kappa the set
of positive operators in the unit ball of B(H) for which every nonzero vector
in the span of S is cyclic is comeager for the strong operator topology.
