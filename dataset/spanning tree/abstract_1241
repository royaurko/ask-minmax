Topological behavior, such as chaos, irreducibility, and mixing of a
one-sided shift of finite type, is well elucidated. Meanwhile, the
investigation of multidimensional shifts, for instance, textile systems is
difficult and only a few results have been obtained so far.
  This paper studies shifts defined on infinite trees, which are called
tree-shifts. Infinite trees have a natural structure of one-sided symbolic
dynamical systems equipped with multiple shift maps and constitute an
intermediate class in between one-sided shifts and multidimensional shifts. We
have shown not only an irreducible tree-shift of finite type, but also a mixing
tree-shift that are chaotic in the sense of Devaney. Furthermore, the graph and
labeled graph representations of tree-shifts are revealed so that the
verification of irreducibility and mixing of a tree-shift is equivalent to
determining the irreducibility and mixing of matrices, respectively. This
extends the classical results of one-sided symbolic dynamics.
  A necessary and sufficient condition for the irreducibility and mixing of
tree-shifts of finite type is demonstrated. Most important of all, the
examination can be done in finite steps with an upper bound.
