If G is a finite graph and n is a natural number, then the n-strand braid
group of G is the fundamental group of the configuration space of n points on
G. This article gives a complete computation of the integral cohomology rings
of the n-strand braid groups in case G is a tree. Some of the argument builds
on earlier joint work with Lucas Sabalka.
