The basic object we consider is a certain model of continuum random tree,
called the stable tree. We construct a fragmentation process $(F^-(t), t>=0)$
out of this tree by removing the vertices located under height $t$. Thanks to a
self-similarity property of the stable tree, we show that the fragmentation
process is also self-similar. The semigroup and other features of the
fragmentation are given explicitly. Asymptotic results are given, as well as a
couple of related results on continuous-state branching processes.
