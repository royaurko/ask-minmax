We prove that if A is the basin of immediate attraction to a periodic
attracting or parabolic point for a rational map f on the Riemann sphere, then
periodic points in the boundary of A are dense in this boundary. To prove this
in the non simply- connected or parabolic situations we prove a more abstract,
geometric coding trees version.
