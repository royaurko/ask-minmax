We describe the structure of those graphs that have largest spectral radius
in the class of all connected graphs with a given degree sequence. We show that
in such a graph the degree sequence is non-increasing with respect to an
ordering of the vertices induced by breadth-first search. For trees the
resulting structure is uniquely determined up to isomorphism. We also show that
the largest spectral radius in such classes of trees is strictly monotone with
respect to majorization.
