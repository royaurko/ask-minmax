The most general single species autonomous reaction-diffusion model on a
Cayley tree with nearest-neighbor interactions is introduced. The stationary
solutions of such models, as well as their dynamics, are discussed. To study
dynamics of the system, directionally-symmetric Green function for evolution
equation of average number density is obtained. In some limiting cases the
Green function is studied. Some examples are worked out in more detail.
