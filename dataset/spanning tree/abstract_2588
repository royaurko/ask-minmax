We demonstrate an octave-spanning frequency comb with a spectrum covering
wavelengths from 1,540 nm up to 3,200 nm. The supercontinuum is generated by
pumping a 1-cm long dispersion engineered silicon wire waveguide by 70 fs
pulses with an energy of merely 15 pJ. We confirm the phase coherence of the
output spectrum by beating the supercontinuum with narrow bandwidth CW lasers.
We show that the experimental results are in agreement with numerical
simulations.
