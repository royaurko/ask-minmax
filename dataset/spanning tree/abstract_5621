We inverse engineer realizable time-dependent semiclassical pulses to invert
or manipulate a two- level system faster than adiabatically when the
rotating-wave approximation cannot be applied. Different inversion routes,
based on a counterdiabatic approach or invariants, lead quite generally to
singular fields. Making use of the relation between the invariants of motion
and the Hamiltonian, and canceling the troublesome singularities, an inversion
scheme is put forward for the regime in which the pulse spans few oscillations.
For many oscillations an alternative numerical minimization method is proposed
and demonstrated.
