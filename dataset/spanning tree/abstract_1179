Plateau's problem is to find a surface with minimal area spanning a given
boundary. In 1960, Reifenberg and Adams developed a definition for "span" using
\v{C}ech homology, and variants of this definition have been used ever sense.
However, limitations of \v{C}ech homology resulted in the lack of a natural
definition for a boundary consisting of more than one component. The contributors
avoided this problem in an earlier paper for codimension one surfaces using
linking numbers to define spanning sets. In this paper, we show how to use
\v{C}ech cohomology to provide a similar definition for all dimensions and
codimensions.
