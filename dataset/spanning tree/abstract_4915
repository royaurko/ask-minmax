The inequality of wealth distribution is a universal phenomenon in the
civilized nations, and it is often imputed to the Matthew effect, that is, the
rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Some philosophers unjustified this
phenomenon and tried to put the human civilization upon the evenness of wealth.
Noticing the facts that 1) the emergence of the centralism is the starting
point of human civilization, i.e., people in a society were organized
hierarchically, 2) the inequality of wealth emerges simultaneously, this paper
proposes a wealth distribution model based on the hidden tree structure from
the viewpoint of complex network. This model considers the organized structure
of people in a society as a hidden tree, and the cooperations among human
beings as the transactions on the hidden tree, thereby explains the
distribution of wealth. This model shows that the scale-free phenomenon of
wealth distribution can be produced by the cascade controlling of human
society, that is, the inequality of wealth can parasitize in the social
organizations, such that any actions in eliminating the unequal wealth
distribution would lead to the destroy of social or economic structures,
resulting in the collapse of the economic system, therefore, would fail in
vain.
