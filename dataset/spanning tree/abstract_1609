Examining botanical trees, Leonardo da Vinci noted that the total
cross-section of branches is conserved across branching nodes. In this Letter,
it is proposed that this rule is a consequence of the tree skeleton having a
self-similar structure and the branch diameters being adjusted to resist
wind-induced loads.
