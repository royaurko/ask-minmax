In this paper, we redesign and simplify an algorithm due to Remy et al. for
the generation of rooted planar trees that satisfies a given partition of
degrees. This new version is now optimal in terms of random bit complexity, up
to a multiplicative constant. We then apply a natural process
"simulate-guess-and-proof" to analyze the height of a random Motzkin in
function of its frequency of unary nodes. When the number of unary nodes
dominates, we prove some unconventional height phenomenon (i.e. outside the
universal square root behaviour.)
