Using the Rossi X-ray Timing Experiment (RXTE), we have observed both the
Seyfert 1 galaxy Akn 120 and the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 120. Monitoring
observations spanning 2 years plus intensive stares spanning several days have
been obtained for both objects. These data have allowed us to construct the
power density spectrum (PDS) for each object. Covering more than 4 decades in
temporal frequency, the PDS for 3C 120 represents the first such measurement
for a radio loud galaxy. The PDS for 3C 120 shows a steep power law at high
frequencies, which turns over at low frequencies. Akn 120 also has a power law
shape in its PDS. Using the PDS of Cygnus X-1, we estimate the masses for both
of these objects. Optical data and cross correlation functions are also
presented for Akn 120. The long-term light curve of Akn 120 shows a strong
correlation with optical data, with zero time lag.
