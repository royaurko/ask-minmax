Tree-level gauge mediation (TGM) is a scenario of SUSY breaking in which the
tree-level exchange of heavy (possibly GUT) vector fields generates
flavor-universal sfermion masses. In this work we extend this framework to the
case of E_6 that is the natural extension of the minimal case studied so far.
Despite the number of possible E_6 subgroups containing G_SM is large (we list
all rank 6 subgroups), there are only three different cases corresponding to
the number of vector messengers. As a robust prediction we find that sfermion
masses are SU(5) invariant at the GUT scale, even if the gauge group does not
contain SU(5). If SUSY breaking is mediated purely by the U(1) generator that
commutes with SO(10) we obtain universal sfermion masses and thus can derive
the CMSSM boundary conditions in a novel scenario.
