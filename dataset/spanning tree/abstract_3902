In this paper, we study symplectic invariants of the open symplectic
manifolds $X_\Gamma$ obtained by plumbing cotangent bundles of spheres
according to a plumbing tree $\Gamma$. We prove that certain models for the
Fukaya category $\mathcal{F}(X_\Gamma)$ of closed exact Lagrangians in
$X_\Gamma$ and the wrapped Fukaya category $\mathcal{W}(X_\Gamma)$ are related
by Koszul duality. As an application, we give explicit computations of
symplectic cohomology of the symplectic manifolds $X_\Gamma$ for all trees
$\Gamma$ but the exceptional cases $E_6$,$E_7$ and $E_8$, based on the
Legendrian surgery formula.
