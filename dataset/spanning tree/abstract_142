In answer to a question of Eggleton, we prove that the complete multigraph on
5 vertices with edge multiplicity 6, namely $K_{5}^{(6)}$, has a decomposition
into 5 copies of the family of trees of order 5 and that $K_{7}^{(22)}$ has a
decomposition into 7 copies of the family of trees of order 7. We prove
something similar for $K_{2n+1}$ for $n \le 13$.
