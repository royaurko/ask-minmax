Quantified propositional intuitionistic logic is obtained from propositional
intuitionistic logic by adding quantifiers \forall p, \exists p over
propositions. In the context of Kripke semantics, a proposition is a subset of
the worlds in a model structure which is upward closed. Kremer (1997) has shown
that the quantified propositional intuitionistic logic H\pi+ based on the class
of all partial orders is recursively isomorphic to full second-order logic. He
raised the question of whether the logic resulting from restriction to trees is
axiomatizable. It is shown that it is, in fact, decidable. The methods used can
also be used to establish the decidability of modal S4 with propositional
quantification on similar types of Kripke structures.
