We prove several results showing that absolutely continuous spectrum for the
Laplacian on radial trees is a rare event. In particular, we show that metric
trees with unbounded edges have purely singular spectrum and that generically
(in the sense of Baire) radial trees have purely singular continuous spectrum.
