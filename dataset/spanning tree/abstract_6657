We introduce a new efficient algorithm for phase space generation. A parton
shower is used to distribute events across all of multiplicity, flavor, and
phase space, and these events can then be reweighted to any desired analytic
distribution. To verify this method, we reproduce the e+e- -> n jets tree-level
result of traditional matrix element tools. We also show how to improve
tree-level matrix elements automatically with leading-logarithmic resummation.
This algorithm is particularly useful in the context of a new framework for
event generation called GenEvA. In a companion paper [arXiv:0801.4026], we show
how the GenEvA framework can address contemporary issues in event generation.
