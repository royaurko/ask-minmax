It is widely believed that the Internet's AS-graph degree distribution obeys
a power-law form. Most of the evidence showing the power-law distribution is
based on BGP data. However, it was recently argued that since BGP collects data
in a tree-like fashion, it only produces a sample of the degree distribution,
and this sample may be biased. This argument was backed by simulation data and
mathematical analysis, which demonstrated that under certain conditions a tree
sampling procedure can produce an artificail power-law in the degree
distribution. Thus, although the observed degree distribution of the AS-graph
follows a power-law, this phenomenon may be an artifact of the sampling
process. In this work we provide some evidence to the contrary. We show, by
analysis and simulation, that when the underlying graph degree distribution
obeys a power-law with an exponent larger than 2, a tree-like sampling process
produces a negligible bias in the sampled degree distribution. Furthermore,
recent data collected from the DIMES project, which is not based on BGP
sampling, indicates that the underlying AS-graph indeed obeys a power-law
degree distribution with an exponent larger than 2. By combining this empirical
data with our analysis, we conclude that the bias in the degree distribution
calculated from BGP data is negligible.
