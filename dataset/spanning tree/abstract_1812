The genealogy at a single locus of a constant size $N$ population in
equilibrium is given by the well-known Kingman's coalescent. When considering
multiple loci under recombination, the ancestral recombination graph encodes
the genealogies at all loci in one graph. For a continuous genome $G$, we study
the tree-valued process $(T^N_u)_{u\in G}$ of genealogies along the genome in
the limit $N\to\infty$. Encoding trees as metric measure spaces, we show
convergence to a tree-valued process with cadlag paths. In addition, we study
mixing properties of the resulting process for loci which are far apart.
