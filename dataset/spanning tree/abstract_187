Consider the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the complete graph with n
vertices, when edges are assigned independent random weights. Endow this tree
with the graph distance renormalized by n^{1/3} and with the uniform measure on
its vertices. We show that the resulting space converges in distribution, as n
tends to infinity, to a random measured metric space in the
Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov topology. We additionally show that the limit is a
random binary R-tree and has Minkowski dimension 3 almost surely. In
particular, its law is mutually singular with that of the Brownian continuum
random tree or any rescaled version thereof. Our approach relies on a coupling
between the MST problem and the Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph. We exploit the
explicit description of the scaling limit of the Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph
in the so-called critical window, established by the first three contributors in an
earlier paper, and provide a similar description of the scaling limit for a
"critical minimum spanning forest" contained within the MST.
