This paper considers the \textit{minimum spanning tree (MST)} problem in the
Congested Clique model and presents an algorithm that runs in $O(\log \log \log
n)$ rounds, with high probability. Prior to this, the fastest MST algorithm in
this model was a deterministic algorithm due to Lotker et al.~(SIAM J on Comp,
2005) from about a decade ago. A key step along the way to designing this MST
algorithm is a \textit{connectivity verification} algorithm that not only runs
in $O(\log \log \log n)$ rounds with high probability, but also has low message
complexity. This allows the fast computation of an MST by running multiple
instances of the connectivity verification algorithm in parallel. These results
depend on a new edge-sampling theorem, developed in the paper, that says that
if each edge $e = \{u, v\}$ is sampled independently with probability $c \log^2
n/\min\{\mbox{degree}(u), \mbox{degree}(v)\}$ (for a large enough constant $c$)
then all cuts of size at least $n$ are approximated in the sampled graph. This
sampling theorem is inspired by series of papers on graph sparsification via
random edge sampling due to Karger~(STOC 1994), Bencz\'ur and Karger~(STOC
1996, arxiv 2002), and Fung et al.~(STOC 2011). The edge sampling techniques in
these papers use probabilities that are functions of edge-connectivity or a
related measure called edge-strength. For the purposes of this paper, these
edge-connectivity measures seem too costly to compute and the main technical
contribution of this paper is to show that degree-based edge-sampling suffices
to approximate large cuts.
