We compute the four-quark plus three-gluon and six-quark plus one-gluon tree
level amplitudes using on-shell recursion relations. They are needed for the
calculation of the 5-jet cross-section at the Born level, and constitute an
essential ingredient for next-to-leading order 4-jet and
next-to-next-to-leading order 3-jet production at hadronic colliders. Very
compact expressions for all possible helicity configurations are provided,
allowing direct implementation in computer codes. With the results presented in
this paper, the full set of seven-parton tree amplitudes becomes available.
