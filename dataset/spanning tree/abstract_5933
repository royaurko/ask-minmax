In this paper we show a monotonicity theorem for the harmonic eigenfunction
of \lambda_{1} of the normalized Laplacian over the points of articulation of a
graph. We introduce the definition of Perron component for the normalized
Laplacian matrix of a graph and show how its second smallest eigenvalue can be
characterized using this definition.
