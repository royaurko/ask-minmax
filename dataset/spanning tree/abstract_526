In this paper, we focus on families of bipartitions, i.e. set partitions
consisting of at most two components. We say that a family of bipartitions is a
separating family for a set $S$ if every two elements in $S$ can be separated
by some bipartition. Furthermore, we call a separating family minimal if no
proper subfamily is a separating family. We characterize the set of all minimal
separating families of maximum size for arbitrary set $S$ as the set of all
spanning trees on $S$ and enumerate minimal separating families of maximum
size. Furthermore, we enumerate separating families of arbitrary size, which
need not be minimal.
