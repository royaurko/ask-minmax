Let $G$ be an infinite graph such that each tree in the wired uniform
spanning forest on $G$ has one end almost surely. On such graphs $G$, we give a
family of continuous, measure preserving, almost one-to-one mappings from the
wired spanning forest on $G$ to recurrent sandpiles on $G$, that we call
anchored burning bijections. In the special case of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \ge 2$,
we show how the anchored bijection, combined with Wilson's stacks of arrows
construction, as well as other known results on spanning trees, yields a power
law upper bound on the rate of convergence to the sandpile measure along any
exhaustion of $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We discuss some open problems related to these
findings.
