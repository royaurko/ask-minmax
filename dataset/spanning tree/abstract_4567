Given a network represented by a weighted directed graph G, we consider the
problem of finding a bounded cost set of nodes S such that the influence
spreading from S in G, within a given time bound, is as large as possible. The
dynamic that governs the spread of influence is the following: initially only
elements in S are influenced; subsequently at each round, the set of influenced
elements is augmented by all nodes in the network that have a sufficiently
large number of already influenced neighbors. We prove that the problem is
NP-hard, even in simple networks like complete graphs and trees. We also derive
a series of positive results. We present exact pseudo-polynomial time
algorithms for general trees, that become polynomial time in case the trees are
unweighted. This last result improves on previously published results. We also
design polynomial time algorithms for general weighted paths and cycles, and
for unweighted complete graphs.
