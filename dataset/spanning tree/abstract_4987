The Solar Diameter Monitor measured the duration of solar meridian transits
during the 6 years 1981 to 1987, spanning the declining half of solar cycle 21.
We have combined these photoelectric measurements with models of the solar
limb-darkening function, deriving a mean value for the solar near-equatorial
radius of 695.508 +- .026 Mm. Annual averages of the radius are identical
within the measurement error of +- .037 Mm.
