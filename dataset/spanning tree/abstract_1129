We study some sequences of polynomials that appear when we consider the
successive derivatives of the tree function (or Lambert's W function). We show
in particular that they are related with a generalization of Cayley trees,
called Greg trees. Besides the combinatorial result in itself, it is
interesting to see how this is related with previous work: similar problems
were considered first by Ramanujan, and more recently in the theory of
completely monotonic functions and its link with probability. Also of great
interest is the fact that these Greg trees were introduced in a problem of
textual criticism, as a kind a genealogical trees, where they had a priori no
mathematical meaning.
