A tentative scaling theory is presented of a tree swaying in a turbulent
wind. It is argued that the turbulence of the air within the crown is in the
inertial regime. An eddy causes a dynamic bending response of the branches
according to a time criterion. The resulting expression for the penetration
depth of the wind yields an exponent which appears to be consistent with that
pertaining to the morphology of the tree branches. An energy criterion shows
that the dynamics of the branches is basically passive. The possibility of
hydrodynamic screening by the leaves is discussed.
