In recent years, non-parametric methods utilizing random walks on graphs have
been used to solve a wide range of machine learning problems, but in their
simplest form they do not scale well due to the quadratic complexity. In this
paper, a new dual-tree based variational approach for approximating the
transition matrix and efficiently performing the random walk is proposed. The
approach exploits a connection between kernel density estimation, mixture
modeling, and random walk on graphs in an optimization of the transition matrix
for the data graph that ties together edge transitions probabilities that are
similar. Compared to the de facto standard approximation method based on
k-nearestneighbors, we demonstrate order of magnitudes speedup without
sacrificing accuracy for Label Propagation tasks on benchmark data sets in
semi-supervised learning.
