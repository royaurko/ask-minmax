The Kneser-Hecke-operator is a linear operator defined on the complex vector
space spanned by the equivalence classes of a family of self-dual codes of
fixed length. It maps a linear self-dual code $C$ over a finite field to the
formal sum of the equivalence classes of those self-dual codes that intersect
$C$ in a codimension 1 subspace. The eigenspaces of this self-adjoint linear
operator may be described in terms of a coding-theory analogue of the Siegel
$\Phi $-operator.
