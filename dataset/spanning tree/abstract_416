This work employs some techniques in order to filter random noise from the
information provided by minimum spanning trees obtained from the correlation
matrices of international stock market indices prior to and during times of
crisis. The first technique establishes a threshold above which connections are
considered affected by noise, based on the study of random networks with the
same probability density distribution of the original data. The second
technique is to judge the strengh of a connection by its survival rate, which
is the amount of time a connection between two stock market indices endure. The
idea is that true connections will survive for longer periods of time, and that
random connections will not. That information is then combined with the
information obtained from the first technique in order to create a smaller
network, where most of the connections are either strong or enduring in time.
