The problem of named entity recognition in the medical/clinical domain has
gained increasing attention do to its vital role in a wide range of clinical
decision support applications. The identification of complete and correct term
span is vital for further knowledge synthesis (e.g., coding/mapping concepts
thesauruses and classification standards). This paper investigates boundary
adjustment by sequence labeling representations models and post-processing
techniques in the problem of clinical named entity recognition (recognition of
clinical events). Using current state-of-the-art sequence labeling algorithm
(conditional random fields), we show experimentally that sequence labeling
representation and post-processing can be significantly helpful in strict
boundary identification of clinical events.
