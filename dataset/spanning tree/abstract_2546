Fixed parameter tractable algorithms for bounded treewidth are known to exist
for a wide class of graph optimization problems. While most research in this
area has been focused on exact algorithms, it is hard to find decompositions of
treewidth sufficiently small to make these al- gorithms fast enough for
practical use. Consequently, tree decomposition based algorithms have limited
applicability to large scale optimization. However, by first reducing the input
graph so that a small width tree decomposition can be found, we can harness the
power of tree decomposi- tion based techniques in a heuristic algorithm, usable
on graphs of much larger treewidth than would be tractable to solve exactly. We
propose a solution merging heuristic to the Steiner Tree Problem that applies
this idea. Standard local search heuristics provide a natural way to generate
subgraphs with lower treewidth than the original instance, and subse- quently
we extract an improved solution by solving the instance induced by this
subgraph. As such the fixed parameter tractable algorithm be- comes an e?cient
tool for our solution merging heuristic. For a large class of sparse benchmark
instances the algorithm is able to find small width tree decompositions on the
union of generated solutions. Subsequently it can often improve on the
generated solutions fast.
