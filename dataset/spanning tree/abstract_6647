Given a finite-dimensional Lie algebra, and a representation by derivations
on the completed symmetric algebra of its dual, a number of interesting twisted
constructions appear: certain twisted Weyl algebras, deformed Leibniz rules,
quantized ``star'' product. We first illuminate a number of interrelations
between these constructions and then proceed to study a special case in certain
precise sense corresponding to the symmetric or Weyl ordering. This case has
been known earlier to be related to computations with Hausdorff series, for
example the expression for the star product is in such terms. For the deformed
Leibniz rule, hence a coproduct, we present here a new nonsymmetric expression,
which is then expanded into a sum of expressions labelled by a class of planar
trees, and for a given tree evaluated by Feynman-like rules. These expressions
are filtered by a bidegree and we show recursion formulas for the sums of
expressions of a given bidegree, and compare the recursions to recursions for
Hausdorff series, including the comparison of initial conditions. This way we
show a direct corespondence between the Hausdorff series and the expression for
twisted coproduct.
