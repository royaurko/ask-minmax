We report high angular resolution, multi-epoch radio observations of the
young pulsar PSR B1800-21. Using two pairs of data sets, each pair spanning
approximately a ten year period, we calculate the proper motion of the pulsar.
We obtain a proper motion of mu_alpha=11.6 +- 1.8 mas/yr, mu_delta=14.8 +- 2.3
mas/yr, which clearly indicates a birth position at the extreme edge of the W30
supernova remnant. Although this does not definitively rule out an association
of W30 and PSR B1800-21, it does not support an association.
