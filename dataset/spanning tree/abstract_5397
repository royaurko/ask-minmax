We call a set $\mathcal S$ of graphs an "even subdivison-factor" of a cubic
graph $G$ if $G$ contains a spanning subgraph $H$ such that every component of
$H$ has an even number of vertices and is a subdivision of an element of
$\mathcal S$. We show that any set of 2-connected graphs which is an even
subdivison-factor of every 3-connected cubic graph, satisfies certain
properties. As a consequence, we disprove a conjecture which was stated in an
attempt to solve the circuit double cover conjecture.
