We study generalized possibilistic computation tree logic model checking in
this paper, which is an extension of possibilistic computation logic model
checking introduced by Y.Li, Y.Li and Z.Ma (2014). The system is modeled by
generalized possibilistic Kripke structures (GPKS, in short), and the verifying
property is specified by a generalized possibilistic computation tree logic
(GPoCTL, in short) formula. Based on generalized possibility measures and
generalized necessity measures, the method of generalized possibilistic
computation tree logic model checking is discussed, and the corresponding
algorithm and its complexity are shown in detail. Furthermore, the comparison
between PoCTL introduced in (2013) and GPoCTL is given. Finally, a thermostat
example is given to illustrate the GPoCTL model-checking method.
