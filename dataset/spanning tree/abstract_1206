We establish maximal trees and graphs for the difference of average distance
and proximity proving thus the corresponding conjecture posed in [4]. We also
establish maximal trees for the difference of average eccentricity and
remoteness and minimal trees for the difference of remoteness and radius
proving thus that the corresponding conjectures posed in [4] hold for trees.
