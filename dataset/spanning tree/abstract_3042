In this paper we study the game $p-$Laplacian on a tree, that is, $$
u(x)=\frac{\alpha}2\left\{\max_{y\in \S(x)}u(y) + \min_{y\in \S(x)}u(y)\right\}
+ \frac{\beta}{m}\sum_{y\in \S(x)} u(y), $$ here $x$ is a vertex of the tree
and $S(x)$ is the set of successors of $x$.
  We study the family of the subsets of the tree that enjoy the unique
continuation property, that is, subsets $U$ such that $u\mid_U=0$ implies $u
\equiv 0$.
