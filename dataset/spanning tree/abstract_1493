Sturmian words are infinite binary words with many equivalent definitions:
They have a minimal factor complexity among all aperiodic sequences; they are
balanced sequences (the labels 0 and 1 are as evenly distributed as possible)
and they can be constructed using a mechanical definition. All this properties
make them good candidates for being extremal points in scheduling problems over
two processors. In this paper, we consider the problem of generalizing Sturmian
words to trees. The problem is to evenly distribute labels 0 and 1 over
infinite trees. We show that (strongly) balanced trees exist and can also be
constructed using a mechanical process as long as the tree is irrational. Such
trees also have a minimal factor complexity. Therefore they bring the hope that
extremal scheduling properties of Sturmian words can be extended to such trees,
as least partially. Such possible extensions are illustrated by one such
example.
