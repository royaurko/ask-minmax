It was shown in \cite{sc12} that for a certain class of structures $\I$,
$\I$-indexed indiscernible sets have the modeling property just in case the age
of $\I$ is a Ramsey class. We expand this known class of structures from
ordered structures in a finite relational language to ordered, locally finite
structures which isolate quantifier-free types by way of quantifier-free
formulas. As a corollary, we may conclude that certain classes of finite trees
are Ramsey, some previously known. See updated paper for new references.
