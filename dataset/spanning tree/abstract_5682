Recent developments of the two MC-generators SPHINX and PEPSI are discussed.
In SPHINX the process of polarized photo production was included to simulate
the potential of a polarized HERA to measure the photon structure function. In
PEPSI the CC polarized cross sections on tree level have been added together
with the electroweak corrections to simulate their effect on CC signals
proposed for a polarized HERA.
