It has recently been shown that the NP-hard problem of calculating the
minimum number of hybridization events that is needed to explain a set of
rooted binary phylogenetic trees by means of a hybridization network is
fixed-parameter tractable if an instance of the problem consists of precisely
two such trees. In this paper, we show that this problem remains
fixed-parameter tractable for an arbitrarily large set of rooted binary
phylogenetic trees. In particular, we present a quadratic kernel.
