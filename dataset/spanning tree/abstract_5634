Tests of local realism and macrorealism have historically been discussed in
very similar terms: Leggett-Garg inequalities follow Bell inequalities as
necessary conditions for classical behavior. Here, we compare the probability
polytopes spanned by all measurable probability distributions for both
scenarios and show that their structure differs strongly between spatially and
temporally separated measurements. We arrive at the conclusion that, in
contrast to tests of local realism where Bell inequalities form a necessary and
sufficient set of conditions, no set of inequalities can ever be necessary and
sufficient for macrorealism. A recently proposed condition, no-signaling in
time, fulfills this criterion, and we show why it is better suited for future
experimental tests of macrorealism.
