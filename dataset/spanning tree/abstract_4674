The Bandwidth Theorem of B\"ottcher, Schacht and Taraz [Mathematische Annalen
343 (1), 175-205] gives minimum degree conditions for the containment of
spanning graphs H with small bandwidth and bounded maximum degree. We
generalise this result to a-arrangeable graphs H with \Delta(H)<sqrt(n)/log(n),
where n is the number of vertices of H.
  Our result implies that sufficiently large n-vertex graphs G with minimum
degree at least (3/4+\gamma)n contain almost all planar graphs on n vertices as
subgraphs. Using techniques developed by Allen, Brightwell and Skokan
[Combinatorica, to appear] we can also apply our methods to show that almost
all planar graphs H have Ramsey number at most 12|H|. We obtain corresponding
results for graphs embeddable on different orientable surfaces.
