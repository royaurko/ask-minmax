We present the results of a long-term program of monitoring of the famous SN
1995N, observed both in photometry (UBVRIJHK bands) and optical spectroscopy.
The observations span a period of about 9 years. These new data, together with
others available in literature, extend from the X-ray wavelengths to the radio,
and allow to estimate the total energy radiated by the supernova over a decade
after its explosion.
