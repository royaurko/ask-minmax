An upper bound on the tree-level mass of the lightest Higgs boson of the
Supersymmetric Singlet Majoron Model is obtained. Contrary to some recent
claims, it is shown to be of the same form as the general mass bound previously
calculated for supersymmetric models with an extended Higgs sector.
Soft-breaking masses or exotic vacuum expectation values do not enter in the
tree-level bound [which is only controlled by the electroweak scale (M_Z)] and
also decouple from the most important radiative corrections to the bound (the
ones coming from the top-stop sector). The derivation of the upper bound for
general Supersymmetric Models is reviewed in order to clarify its range of
applicability.
