In this paper we prove that we can find a labeled packing of a non star tree
$T$ into $T^6$ with $m_T+\lceil\frac{n-m_T}{5}\rceil$ labels, where $n$ is the
number of vertices of $T$ and $m_T$ is the maximum number of leaves that can be
removed from $T$ in such a way that the obtained graph is a non star tree.
Also, we prove that we can find a labeled packing of a non star tree $T$ into
$T^5$ with $m_T+1$ labels and a labeled packing of a path $P_n$, $n\geq 4$,
into $P_n^4$ with $\lceil \frac{n}{4}\rceil$ labels.
