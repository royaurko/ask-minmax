We show how certain properties of the Anderson model on a tree are related to
the solutions of a non-linear integral equation. Whether the wave function is
extended or localized, for example, corresponds to whether or not the equation
has a complex solution. We show how the equation can be solved in a weak
disorder expansion. We find that, for small disorder strength $\lambda$, there
is an energy $E_c(\lambda )$ above which the density of states and the
conducting properties vanish to all orders in perturbation theory. We compute
perturbatively the position of the line $E_c(\lambda )$ which begins, in the
limit of zero disorder, at the band edge of the pure system. Inside the band of
the pure system the density of states and conducting properties can be computed
perturbatively. This expansion breaks down near $E_c(\lambda )$ because of
small denominators. We show how it can be resummed by choosing the appropriate
scaling of the energy. For energies greater than $E_c(\lambda )$ we show that
non-perturbative effects contribute to the density of states but have been
unable tell whether they also contribute to the conducting properties.
