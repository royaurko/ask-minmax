We show that the problem of the existence of universal graphs with specified
forbidden subgraphs can be systematically reduced to certain critical cases by
a simple pruning technique which simplifies the underlying structure of the
forbidden graphs, viewed as trees of blocks. As an application, we characterize
the trees T for which a universal countable T-free graph exists.
