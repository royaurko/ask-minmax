Computations in Quasi-Multi-Regge kinematics are much simplified using an
effective theory pioneered by Lipatov. This high-energy effective theory does
not come from an integrating out procedure, and suitable counterterms and
regularization have to be provided beyond tree level. In this note we explain
this prescription and illustrate it with one- and two-loop examples.
