Fomin (1994) introduced a notion of duality between two graded graphs on the
same set of vertices. He also introduced a generalization to dual graded graphs
of the classical Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm. We show how Fomin's
approach applies to the binary search tree insertion algorithm also known as
sylvester insertion, and to the hypoplactic insertion algorithm.
