A Bayesian treatment of latent directed graph structure for non-iid data is
provided where each child datum is sampled with a directed conditional
dependence on a single unknown parent datum. The latent graph structure is
assumed to lie in the family of directed out-tree graphs which leads to
efficient Bayesian inference. The latent likelihood of the data and its
gradients are computable in closed form via Tutte's directed matrix tree
theorem using determinants and inverses of the out-Laplacian. This novel
likelihood subsumes iid likelihood, is exchangeable and yields efficient
unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. In addition to handling
taxonomy and phylogenetic datasets the out-tree assumption performs
surprisingly well as a semi-parametric density estimator on standard iid
datasets. Experiments with unsupervised and semisupervised learning are shown
on various UCI and taxonomy datasets.
