We give a systematic development of the application of matrix norms to rapid
mixing in spin systems. We show that rapid mixing of both random update Glauber
dynamics and systematic scan Glauber dynamics occurs if any matrix norm of the
associated dependency matrix is less than 1. We give improved analysis for the
case in which the diagonal of the dependency matrix is $\mathbf{0}$ (as in heat
bath dynamics). We apply the matrix norm methods to random update and
systematic scan Glauber dynamics for coloring various classes of graphs. We
give a general method for estimating a norm of a symmetric nonregular matrix.
This leads to improved mixing times for any class of graphs which is hereditary
and sufficiently sparse including several classes of degree-bounded graphs such
as nonregular graphs, trees, planar graphs and graphs with given tree-width and
genus.
