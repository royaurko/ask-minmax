Let $\MC$ be the moduli space of stable holomorphic vector bundles of rank 2
and fixed determinant of odd degree, over a smooth projective curve $C$. This
paper identifies the algebraic cohomology ring $\HA^*(\MC)$, i.e. the subring
of the rational cohomology ring $H^*(\MC;\QQ)$ spanned by the fundamental
classes of algebraic cycles, in terms of the algebraic cohomology ring of the
Jacobian $\JC$.
