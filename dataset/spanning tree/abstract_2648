The stack of iterated integrals of a path is embedded in a larger algebraic
structure where iterated integrals are indexed by decorated rooted trees and
where an extended Chen's multiplicative property involves the
D\"urr-Connes-Kreimer coproduct on rooted trees. This turns out to be the
natural setting for a non-geometric theory of rough paths.
