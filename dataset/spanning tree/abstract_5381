We present an unexpected application of tropical convexity to the
determination of invariants for linear systems of differential equations. We
show that the classical G\'erard-Levelt lattice saturation procedure can be
geometrically understood in terms of a projection on the tropical linear space
attached to a subset of the local affine Bruhat-Tits building, that we call the
G\'erard-Levelt membrane. This provides a way to compute the true Poincar\'e
rank, but also the Katz rank of a meromorphic connection without having to
perform gauge transforms nor ramifications of the variable. We finally present
an efficient algorithm to compute this tropical projection map, generalising
Ardila's method for Bergman fans to the case of the tight-span of a valuated
matroid.
