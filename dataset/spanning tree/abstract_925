For random percolation at p_c, the probability distribution P(n) of the
number of spanning clusters (n) has been studied in large scale simulations.
The results are compatible with $P(n) \sim \exp(-an^2)$ for all dimensions. We
also study the variation of the average size (mass) of the spanning clusters
when there are more than one spanning cluster. While the average size of the
spanning clusters scales as usual with $L^D$ where $D = d- \beta/\nu$ for any
number of clusters, it shows a smooth decrease as the number of spanning
clusters increases.
