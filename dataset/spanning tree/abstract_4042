We establish several contraction formulas for Kirchhoff index. We relate
Kirchhoff index with some other metrized graph invariants. By applying our
contraction formulas successively when the graph is a tree, we derive new
formulas for Wiener index and obtain some previously known Wiener index
formulas with new proofs.
