We investigate algorithms to find the first vertex in large trees generated
by either the uniform attachment or preferential attachment model. We require
the algorithm to output a set of $K$ vertices, such that, with probability at
least $1-\epsilon$, the first vertex is in this set. We show that for any
$\epsilon$, there exist such algorithms with $K$ independent of the size of the
input tree. Moreover, we provide almost tight bounds for the best value of $K$
as a function of $\epsilon$. In the uniform attachment case we show that the
optimal $K$ is subpolynomial in $1/\epsilon$, and that it has to be at least
superpolylogarithmic. On the other hand, the preferential attachment case is
exponentially harder, as we prove that the best $K$ is polynomial in
$1/\epsilon$. We conclude the paper with several open problems.
