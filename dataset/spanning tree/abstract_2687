Let G be a finitely presented group. Scott and Swarup have constructed a
canonical splitting of G which encloses all almost invariant sets over
virtually polycyclic subgroups of a given length. We give an alternative
construction of this regular neighbourhood, by showing that it is the tree of
cylinders of a JSJ splitting.
