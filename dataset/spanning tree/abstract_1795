We study random trees which are invariant in law under the operation of
contracting each edge independently with probability p \in (0,1). We show that
all such trees can be constructed through Poissonian sampling from random
measured real trees satisfying a natural scale invariance property. This has
connections to exchangeable partially ordered sets, real-valued self-similar
increasing processes and quasi-stationary distributions of Galton-Watson
processes.
