Magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of high-purity, giant magnetocaloric
polycrystalline and single-crystalline Fe2P are investigated. Fe2P displays a
moderate magnetic entropy change which spans over 70 K and the presence of
strong magnetization anisotropy proves this system is not fully itinerant but
displays a mix of itinerant and localized magnetism. The properties of pure
Fe2P are compared to those of giant magnetocaloric (Fe,Mn)2(P,A) compounds
helping understand the exceptional characteristics shown by the latter which
are so promising for heat pump and energy conversion applications.
