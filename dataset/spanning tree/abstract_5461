This paper theoretically and experimentally presents a first report on
broadband enhanced transmission through stacked metallic multi-layers
perforated with coaxial annular apertures (CAAs). Different from previous
studies on extraordinary transmission that occurs at a single frequency, the
enhanced transmission of our system with two or three metallic layers can span
a wide frequency range with a bandwidth about 60% of the central frequency. The
phenomena arise from the excitation and hybridization of guided resonance modes
in CAAs among different layers. Measured transmission spectra are in good
agreement with calculations semi-analytically resolved by modal expansion
method.
