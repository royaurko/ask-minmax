Determining the interaction partners among protein/domain families poses hard
computational problems, in particular in the presence of paralogous proteins.
Available approaches aim to identify interaction partners among protein/domain
families through maximizing the similarity between trimmed versions of their
phylogenetic trees. Since maximization of any natural similarity score is
computationally difficult, many approaches employ heuristics to maximize the
distance matrices corresponding to the tree topologies in question. In this
paper we devise an efficient deterministic algorithm which directly maximizes
the similarity between two leaf labeled trees with edge lengths, obtaining a
score-optimal alignment of the two trees in question.
  Our algorithm is significantly faster than those methods based on distance
matrix comparison: 1 minute on a single processor vs. 730 hours on a
supercomputer. Furthermore we have advantages over the current state-of-the-art
heuristic search approach in terms of precision as well as a recently suggested
overall performance measure for mirrortree approaches, while incurring only
acceptable losses in recall.
