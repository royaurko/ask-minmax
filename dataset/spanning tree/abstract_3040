Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods are drawing great interest after
yielding breakthrough results in computer Go. This paper proposes a Bayesian
approach to MCTS that is inspired by distributionfree approaches such as UCT
[13], yet significantly differs in important respects. The Bayesian framework
allows potentially much more accurate (Bayes-optimal) estimation of node values
and node uncertainties from a limited number of simulation trials. We further
propose propagating inference in the tree via fast analytic Gaussian
approximation methods: this can make the overhead of Bayesian inference
manageable in domains such as Go, while preserving high accuracy of
expected-value estimates. We find substantial empirical outperformance of UCT
in an idealized bandit-tree test environment, where we can obtain valuable
insights by comparing with known ground truth. Additionally we rigorously prove
on-policy and off-policy convergence of the proposed methods.
