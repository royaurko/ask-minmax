We generalize the concept of ascending runs from permutations to Cayley trees
and mappings. A combinatorial decomposition of the corresponding functional
digraph allows us to obtain exact enumeration formulae that show an interesting
connection to the Stirling numbers of the second kind. Using a bijective proof
of Cayley's formula, we can show why the numbers of trees with a given number
of ascending runs are directly linked to the corresponding numbers for
mappings. Moreover, analytic tools allow a characterization of the limiting
distribution of the random variable counting the number of ascending runs in a
random mapping. As for permutations, this is a normal distribution with linear
mean and variance.
