In 1940, Luis Santal\'o proved a Helly-type theorem for line transversals to
boxes in R^d. An analysis of his proof reveals a convexity structure for
ascending lines in R^d that is isomorphic to the ordinary notion of convexity
in a convex subset of R^{2d-2}. This isomorphism is through a Cremona
transformation on the Grassmannian of lines in P^d, which enables a precise
description of the convex hull and affine span of up to d ascending lines: the
lines in such an affine span turn out to be the rulings of certain classical
determinantal varieties. Finally, we relate Cremona convexity to a new
convexity structure that we call frame convexity, which extends to
arbitrary-dimensional flats.
