Consider the coradical filtrations of the Hopf algebras of planar binary
trees of Loday and Ronco and of permutations of Malvenuto and Reutenauer. We
give explicit isomorphisms showing that the associated graded Hopf algebras are
dual to the cocommutative Hopf algebras introduced in the late 1980's by
Grossman and Larson. These Hopf algebras are constructed from ordered trees and
heap-ordered trees, respectively. These results follow from the fact that
whenever one starts from a Hopf algebra that is a cofree graded coalgebra, the
associated graded Hopf algebra is a shuffle Hopf algebra.
