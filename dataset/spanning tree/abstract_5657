Singularity-free cosmological solutions may be obtained from the string
action at tree level if the dimension of the space-time is greater than 10 and
if brane configurations are taken into account. The behaviour of the dilaton
field in this case is also regular. Asymptotically a radiative phase is
attained indicating a smooth transition to the standard cosmological model.
