We present results on the production of direct photons, pizero, and eta
mesons on nuclear targets at large transverse momenta (p_T). The data are from
530 and 800 GeV/c proton beams and 515 GeV/c piminus beams incident upon copper
and beryllium targets that span the kinematic range of 1.0 < p_T < 10 GeV/c at
central rapidities.
