Schramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLEs) have proved an efficient way to describe a
single continuous random conformally invariant interface in a simply-connected
planar domain; the admissible probability distributions are parameterized by a
single positive parameter $\kappa$. As shown in \cite{D6}, the coexistence of
$n$ interfaces in such a domain implies algebraic (``commutation'') conditions.
In the most interesting situations, the admissible laws on systems of $n$
interfaces are parameterized by $\kappa$ and the solution of a particular
(finite rank) holonomic system.
  The study of solutions of differential systems, in particular their global
behaviour, often involves the use of integral representations. In the present
article, we provide Euler integral representations for solutions of holonomic
systems arising from SLE commutation. Applications to critical percolation
(general crossing formulae), Loop-Erased Random Walks (direct derivation of
Fomin's formulae in the scaling limit), and Uniform Spanning Trees are
discussed. The connection with conformal restriction and Poissonized
non-intersection for chordal SLEs is also studied.
