A realisation of a metric $d$ on a finite set $X$ is a weighted graph $(G,w)$
whose vertex set contains $X$ such that the shortest-path distance between
elements of $X$ considered as vertices in $G$ is equal to $d$. Such a
realisation $(G,w)$ is called optimal if the sum of its edge weights is minimal
over all such realisations. Optimal realisations always exist, although it is
NP-hard to compute them in general, and they have applications in areas such as
phylogenetics, electrical networks and internet tomography. In [Adv. in Math.
53, 1984, 321-402] A.~Dress showed that the optimal realisations of a metric
$d$ are closely related to a certain polytopal complex that can be canonically
associated to $d$ called its tight-span. Moreover, he conjectured that the
(weighted) graph consisting of the zero- and one-dimensional faces of the
tight-span of $d$ must always contain an optimal realisation as a homeomorphic
subgraph. In this paper, we prove that this conjecture does indeed hold for a
certain class of metrics, namely the class of totally"=decomposable metrics
whose tight-span has dimension two. As a corollary, it follows that the minimum
Manhattan network problem is a special case of finding optimal realisations of
two-dimensional totally-decomposable metrics.
