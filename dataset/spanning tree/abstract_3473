The applications of the existing Liouville theories for the description of
the longitudinal dynamics of non-critical Nambu-Goto string are analyzed. We
show that the recently developed DOZZ solution to the Liouville theory leads to
the cut singularities in tree string amplitudes. We propose a new version of
the Polyakov geometric approach to Liouville theory and formulate its basic
consistency condition - the geometric bootstrap equation. Also in this approach
the tree amplitudes develop cut singularieties.
