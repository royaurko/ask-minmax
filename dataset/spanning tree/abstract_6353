The charge-symmetry-breaking amplitudes for the recently observed d d ->
alpha pi0 reaction are investigated. Chiral perturbation theory is used to
classify and identify the leading-order terms. Specific forms of the related
one- and two-body tree level diagrams are derived. As a first step toward a
full calculation, a few tree-level two-body diagrams are evaluated at each
considered order, using a simplified set of d and alpha wave functions and a
plane-wave approximation for the initial dd state. The leading-order
pion-exchange term is shown to be suppressed in this model because of poor
overlap of the initial and final states. The higher-order one-body and
short-range (heavy-meson-exchange) amplitudes provide better matching between
the initial and final states and therefore contribute significantly and
coherently to the cross section. The consequences this might have for a full
calculation, with realistic wave functions and a more complete set of
amplitudes, are discussed.
