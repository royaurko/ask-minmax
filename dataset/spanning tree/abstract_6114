Macroscopic sliding between two solids is triggered by the propagation of a
micro-slip front along the frictional interface. In certain conditions, sliding
is preceded by the propagation of aborted fronts, spanning only part of the
contact interface. The selection of the characteristic size spanned by those
so-called precursors remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a 1D toy
model of precursors between a slider and a track in which the fronts are
quasi-static self-healing slip pulses. When the slider's thickness is large
compared to the elastic correlation length and when the interfacial stiffness
is small compared with the bulk stiffness, we provide an analytical solution
for the length of the first precursor, {\Lambda}, and the shear stress field
associated with it. These quantities are given as a function of the bulk
material parameters, the frictional properties of the interface and the
macroscopic loading conditions. Analytical results are in quantitative
agreement with the numerical solution of the model. In contrast with previous
models, our model predicts that {\Lambda} does not depend on the frictional
breaking threshold of the interface. Our results should be relevant to the
various systems in which self-healing slip pulses have been observed.
