We prove that the growth constants for nearest-neighbour lattice trees and
lattice (bond) animals on the integer lattice Zd are asymptotic to 2de as the
dimension goes to infinity, and that their critical one-point functions
converge to e.
  Similar results are obtained in dimensions d>8 in the limit of increasingly
spread-out models; in this case the result for the growth constant is a special
case of previous results of M. Penrose.
  The proof is elementary, once we apply previous results of T. Hara and G.
Slade obtained using the lace expansion.
