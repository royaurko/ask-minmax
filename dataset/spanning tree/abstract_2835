The wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a power constrained system, since
nodes run on limited power batteries which shorten its lifespan.The main
challenge facing us in the design and conception of Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSNs) is to find the best way to extend their life span. The clustering
algorithm is a key technique used to increase the scalability and life span of
the network in general. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a distributed
energy-efficient clustering algorithm for WSNs. This heterogeneous-energy
protocol is a new clustering algorithm to decrease probability of failure nodes
and in which we introduce the node's remaining energy so as to determine the
cluster heads. We study the impact of heterogeneity of nodes on WSNs that are
hierarchically clustered. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm increases the life span of the whole network and performs better than
LEACH and EEHC according to the metric:first node dies.
