We present the historic light curve of 1WGA J0447.9-0322, spanning the time
interval from 1962 to 1991, built using the Asiago archive plates. The source
shows small fluctuations of about 0.3 mag around B=16 until 1986 and a fast
dimming of its average level by about 0.5 mag after that date, again with small
short term variations. The variability pattern is within the values shown by
other QSOs with long term monitoring, notwithstanding its high X-ray/optical
ratio. We present also its overall SED using literature data and recent
UV-optical SWIFT observations.
