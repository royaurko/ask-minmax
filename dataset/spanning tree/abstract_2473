We develop a theory of Goodwillie calculus for functors between
$G$-equivariant homotopy theories, where $G$ is a finite group. We construct
$J$-excisive approximations of a homotopy functor for any finite $G$-set $J$.
These fit together into a poset, the Goodwillie tree, that extends the
classical Goodwillie tower. We prove convergence results for the tree of a
functor on pointed $G$-spaces that commutes with fixed-points, and we
reinterpret the Tom Dieck-splitting as an instance of a more general splitting
phenomenon that occurs for the fixed-points of the equivariant derivative of
these functors. As our main example we describe the layers of the tree of the
identity functor in terms of the equivariant Spanier-Whitehead duals of the
partition complexes.
