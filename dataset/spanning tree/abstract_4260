We consider the problem of using a heuristic policy to improve the value
approximation by the Upper Confidence Bound applied in Trees (UCT) algorithm in
non-adversarial settings such as planning with large-state space Markov
Decision Processes. Current improvements to UCT focus on either changing the
action selection formula at the internal nodes or the rollout policy at the
leaf nodes of the search tree. In this work, we propose to add an auxiliary arm
to each of the internal nodes, and always use the heuristic policy to roll out
simulations at the auxiliary arms. The method aims to get fast convergence to
optimal values at states where the heuristic policy is optimal, while retaining
similar approximation as the original UCT in other states. We show that
bootstrapping with the proposed method in the new algorithm, UCT-Aux, performs
better compared to the original UCT algorithm and its variants in two benchmark
experiment settings. We also examine conditions under which UCT-Aux works well.
