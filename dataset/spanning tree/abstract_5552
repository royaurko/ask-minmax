In this paper we show that the global attractor of the 1D damped, driven,
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) is embedded in the long-time dynamics of
a determining form. The determining form is an ordinary differential equation
in a space of trajectories $X=C_b^1(\mathbb{R}, P_mH^2)$ where $P_m$ is the
$L^2$-projector onto the span of the first $m$ Fourier modes. There is a
one-to-one identification with the trajectories in the global attractor of the
NLS and the steady states of the determining form. We also give an improved
estimate for the number of the determining modes.
