A major problem for inferring species trees from gene trees is that
evolutionary processes can sometimes favour gene tree topologies that conflict
with an underlying species tree. In the case of incomplete lineage sorting,
this phenomenon has recently been well-studied, and some elegant solutions for
species tree reconstruction have been proposed. One particularly simple and
statistically consistent estimator of the species tree under incomplete lineage
sorting is to combine three-taxon analyses, which are phylogenetically robust
to incomplete lineage sorting. In this paper, we consider whether such an
approach will also work under lateral gene transfer (LGT). By providing an
exact analysis of some cases of this model, we show that there is a zone of
inconsistency for triplet-based species tree reconstruction under LGT. However,
a triplet-based approach will consistently reconstruct a species tree under
models of LGT, provided that the expected number of LGT transfers is not too
high. Our analysis involves a novel connection between the LGT problem and
random walks on cyclic graphs. We have implemented a procedure for
reconstructing trees subject to LGT or lineage sorting in settings where taxon
coverage may be patchy and illustrate its use on two sample data sets.
