We give a new characterization of the Tutte polynomial of graphs. Our
characterization is formally close (but inequivalent) to the original
definition given by Tutte as the generating function of spanning trees counted
according to activities. Tutte's notion of activity requires to choose a
\emph{linear order} on the edge set (though the generating function of the
activities is, in fact, independent of this order). We define a new notion of
activity, the embedding-activity, which requires to choose a
\emph{combinatorial embedding} of the graph, that is, a cyclic order of the
edges around each vertex. We prove that the Tutte polynomial equals the
generating function of spanning trees counted according to embedding-activities
(this generating function being, in fact, independent of the embedding).
