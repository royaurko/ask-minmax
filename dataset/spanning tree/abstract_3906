The size-Ramsey number of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of edges in a
graph $H$ such that every 2-edge-coloring of $H$ yields a monochromatic copy of
$G$. Size-Ramsey numbers of graphs have been studied for almost 40 years with
particular focus on the case of trees and bounded degree graphs.
  We initiate the study of size-Ramsey numbers for $k$-uniform hypergraphs.
Analogous to the graph case, we consider the size-Ramsey number of cliques,
paths, trees, and bounded degree hypergraphs. Our results suggest that
size-Ramsey numbers for hypergraphs are extremely difficult to determine, and
many open problems remain.
