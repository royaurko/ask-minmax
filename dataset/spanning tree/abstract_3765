Models for Majorana neutrino masses can be classified according to the level
in perturbation theory at which the effective dimension five operator $LLHH$ is
realized. The possibilities range from the tree-level up to the three-loop
level realizations. We discuss some general aspects of this approach and
speculate about a model independent classification of the possible cases. Among
all the realizations, those in which the effective operator is induced by
radiative corrections open the possibility for lepton number violation near -or
at- the electroweak scale. We discuss some phenomenological aspects of two
generic radiative realizations: the Babu-Zee model and supersymmetric models
with bilinear R-parity violation.
