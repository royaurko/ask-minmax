We present $^{12}$CO(J=1--0) line observations of 22 low-luminosity spiral
galaxies in the Virgo cluster. These data, together with 244 others available
in the literature, allow us to build a large sample that we use to study the
molecular gas properties of galaxies spanning a large range of morphological
types and luminosities and belonging to different environments (clusters -
field). The molecular gas content of the target galaxies is estimated using a
luminosity-dependent X = $N(H_2)/I(CO)$ conversion factor that has been
calibrated on a sample of nearby galaxies. $X$ spans from $\sim$ 10$^{20}$ mol
cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$ in giant spirals to $\sim$ 10$^{21}$ mol
cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$ in dwarf irregulars. The value of the $X$
conversion factor is found consistent with a value derived independently from
dust masses estimated from FIR fluxes, with a metallicity-dependent dust to gas
ratio. The relationships between X and the UV radiation field (as traced by the
$H\alpha+[NII] E.W.$), the metallicity and the H band luminosity are analysed.
We show that the molecular gas contained in molecular clouds or complexes is of
the order of 15% of the total gas on average whatever the luminosity or the
Hubble type of the galaxies. We discuss the relation between the star formation
rate and the molecular gas content and estimate the average star formation
efficiency of late-type galaxies.
