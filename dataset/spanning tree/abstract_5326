Using general arguments of an optimization taking place between the pair wave
function and the repulsive part of the electron-electron interaction, we
analyze the superconducting gap in materials with multiple Fermi-surface (FS)
pockets, with exemplary application to two proto-type ferropnictide setups. On
the basis of functional renormalization group (FRG) calculations for a wide
parameter span of the bare interactions, we show that the symmetry of the gap
and the nodal versus nodeless behavior is driven by this optimization
requirement.
