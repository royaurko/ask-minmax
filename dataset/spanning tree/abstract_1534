A metric tree ($M$, $d$), also known as $\mathbb{R}$-trees or $T$-theory, is
a metric space such that between any two points there is an unique arc and that
arc is isometric to an interval in $\mathbb{R}$. In this paper after presenting
some fundamental properties of metric trees and metric segments, we will give a
characterization of compact metric trees in terms of metric segments. Two
common measures of noncompactness are the ball and set measures, respectively
defined as \[ \beta(S) = \inf \{\epsilon \mid S {has a finite} \epsilon {-net
in} M\} {and} \] \[ \alpha(S) = \inf\{\epsilon \mid S {has a finite cover of
sets of diameter} \leq \epsilon\}. \] We will prove that $\alpha = 2\beta$ for
all metric trees. We give two independent proofs of this result, first of which
depends on the fact that given a metric tree $M$ and a subset $E$ of diameter
$2r$, then for all $\ep >0$ there exists $m \in M$ such that $E \subset
B(m;r+\ep)$. The second proof depends on the calculation of underlying
geometric constant, Lifschitz characteristic of a metric tree. It is well known
that the classes of condensing or contractive operators defined relative to
distinct measures of noncompactness are not equal in general, however in case
of metric trees, we show that a map $T$ between two metric trees is $k$-set
contractive if and only if it is $k$-ball contractive for $k\geq 0$.}
