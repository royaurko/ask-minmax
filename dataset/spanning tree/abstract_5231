A {\it star-factor} of a graph $G$ is a spanning subgraph of $G$ such that
each component of which is a star. Recently, Hartnell and Rall studied a family
$\mathscr{U}$ of graphs satisfying the property that every star-factor of a
member graph has the same number of edges. They determined the family
$\mathscr{U}$ when the girth is at least five. In this paper, we investigate
the family of graphs with girth three and determine all members of this family.
