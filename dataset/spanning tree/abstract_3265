In [Watanabe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 190601 (2004)], the contributors show
numerically that spanning and percolation probabilities in two-dimensional
systems with different aspect ratios obey a form of "superscaling". In this
comment, we would like to point out some difficulties with their proposed
scaling ansatz and suggest why this remained undetected in their numerical
analysis.
