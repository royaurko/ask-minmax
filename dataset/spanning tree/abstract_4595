We generated a sample of 409 AGNs for which both the radio luminosity at 5
GHz and the line luminosity in [OIII] 5007 have been measured. The radio
luminosity spans a range of ten orders of magnitude, and the [OIII] line
luminosity spans a range of eight orders of magnitude --- both considerably
larger than the ranges in previous studies. We show that these two quantities
are correlated in a similar way for both radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs. We
demonstrate that the observed correlation can be explained in terms of a model
in which jets are accelerated and collimated by a vertical magnetic field.
