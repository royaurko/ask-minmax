The vertex v of a graph G is called a 1-critical-vertex for the maximum genus
of the graph, or for simplicity called 1-critical-vertex, if G-v is a connected
graph and {\deg}M(G - v) = {\deg}M(G) - 1. In this paper, through the
joint-tree model, we obtained some types of 1-critical-vertex, and get the
upper embeddability of the Spiral Snm .
