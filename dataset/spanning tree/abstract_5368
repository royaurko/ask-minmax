We present time-resolved spectroscopy of the polar RBS0324(=1RXS
J023052.9-684203) spanning more than one orbital cycle. The emission lines
present complex and variable profiles. Radial velocities were determined for
the HeII4686 and Hbeta emission lines. The curves are similar for both lines,
with a semi-amplitude of about 250 km/s. The modulation of 1.5 mag of the
continuum flux is compatible with those previously presented in the literature.
All these characteristics are typical of polars.
