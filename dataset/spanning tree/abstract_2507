The {\it theory unifying spin and charges and predicting families}, proposed
by N.S.M.B., predicts at the low energy regime two (in the mixing matrix
elements decoupled) groups of four families. There are two kinds of
contributions to mass matrices in this theory. One kind distinguishes on the
tree level only among the members of one family, that is among the $u$-quark,
$d$-quark, neutrino and electron, the left and right handed, while the other
kind distinguishes only among the families. Mass matrices for $d$-quarks and
electrons are on the tree level correspondingly strongly correlated and so are
mass matrices for $u$-quarks and neutrinos, up to the term, the Majorana term,
which is nonzero only for right handed neutrinos. Beyond the tree level both
kinds of contributions start to contribute coherently and it is expected that a
detailed study of properties of mass matrices beyond the tree level explains
drastic differences in masses and mixing matrices between quarks and leptons.
We report in this paper on analysis of one loop corrections to the tree level
fermion masses and mixing matrices. Loop diagrams are mediated by the gauge
bosons and the two kinds of scalar fields. A detailed numerical analysis of
fermion masses and mixing, including neutrinos, within this scenario is in
progress and preparation.
