We consider a population model where individuals behave independently from
each other and whose genealogy is described by a chronological tree called
splitting tree. The individuals have i.i.d. (non-exponential) lifetime
durations and give birth at constant rate to clonal or mutant children in an
infinitely many alleles model with neutral mutations. First, to study the
allelic partition of the population, we are interested in its frequency
spectrum, which, at a fixed time, describes the number of alleles carried by a
given number of individuals and with a given age. We compute the expected value
of this spectrum and obtain some almost sure convergence results thanks to
classical properties of Crump-Mode-Jagers (CMJ) processes counted by random
characteristics. Then, by using multitype CMJ-processes, we get asymptotic
properties about the number of alleles that have undergone a fixed number of
mutations with respect to the ancestral allele of the population.
