Let K \subset L be a field extension. Given K-subspaces A,B of L, we study
the subspace spanned by the product set AB = {ab | a \in A, b \in B}. We obtain
some lower bounds on the dimension of this subspace and on dim B^n in terms of
dim A, dim B and n. This is achieved by establishing linear versions of
constructions and results in additive number theory mainly due to Kemperman and
Olson.
