An important problem in geometric computing is defining and computing
similarity between two geometric shapes, e.g. point sets, curves and surfaces,
etc. Important geometric and topological information of many shapes can be
captured by defining a tree structure on them (e.g. medial axis and contour
trees). Hence, it is natural to study the problem of comparing similarity
between trees. We study gapped edit distance between two ordered labeled trees,
first proposed by Touzet \cite{Touzet2003}.
  Given two binary trees $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ with $m$ and $n$ nodes. We compute
the general gap edit distance in $O(m^{3}n^{2} + m^{2}n^{3})$ time. The
computation of this distance in the case of arbitrary trees has shown to be
NP-hard \cite{Touzet2003}. We also give an algorithm for computing the complete
subtree gap edit distance, which can be applied to comparing contour trees of
terrains in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.
