This report details conditions under which the Functional Convolution Model
described in \citet{AHG13} can be identified from Ordinary Least Squares
estimates without either dimension reduction or smoothing penalties. We
demonstrate that if the covariate functions are not spanned by the space of
solutions to linear differential equations, the functional coefficients in the
model are uniquely determined in the Sobolev space of functions with absolutely
continuous second derivatives.
