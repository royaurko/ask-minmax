One approach in phylogenomics to infer the tree of life is based on
concatenated multiple sequence alignments from many genes. Unfortunately, the
resulting so-called supermatrix is usually sparse, that is, not every gene
sequence is available for all species in the supermatrix. Due to the missing
sequence information a phylogenetic inference, assuming that each gene evolves
with its own substitution model, suffers from phylogenetic terraces on which
many phylogenetic trees show the same likelihood. Here, we propose a
phylogenetic terrace aware (PTA) data structure for efficient supermatrix based
tree inference under partition models. PTA avoids likelihood computations for
trees belonging to the same terrace. PTA is implemented in the IQ-TREE
software, and leads to an 1.7 to 6-fold speedup for real data sets compared
with a na\"ive implementation. Speedups are independent on terrace sizes but
correlate with the amount of missing data. Thus, the PTA data structure is well
suited for phylogenomic analyses. IQ-TREE source codes, binaries and
