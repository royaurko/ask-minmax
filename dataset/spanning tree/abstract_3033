A tree $T$ is said to be homogeneous if it is uniquely rooted and there
exists an integer $b\geq 2$, called the branching number of $T$, such that
every $t\in T$ has exactly $b$ immediate successors. We study the behavior of
measurable events in probability spaces indexed by homogeneous trees.
  Precisely, we show that for every integer $b\geq 2$ and every integer $n\geq
1$ there exists an integer $q(b,n)$ with the following property. If $T$ is a
homogeneous tree with branching number $b$ and $\{A_t:t\in T\}$ is a family of
measurable events in a probability space $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)$ satisfying
$\mu(A_t)\geq\epsilon>0$ for every $t\in T$, then for every $0<\theta<\epsilon$
there exists a strong subtree $S$ of $T$ of infinite height such that for every
non-empty finite subset $F$ of $S$ of cardinality $n$ we have \[
\mu\Big(\bigcap_{t\in F} A_t\Big) \meg \theta^{q(b,n)}. \] In fact, we can take
$q(b,n)= \big((2^b-1)^{2n-1}-1\big)\cdot(2^b-2)^{-1}$. A finite version of this
result is also obtained.
