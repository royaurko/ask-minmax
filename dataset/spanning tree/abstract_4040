The Huffman coding algorithm is interpreted in the lattice of partitions of
the source alphabet. Maximal chains in the partition lattice correspond to
linear extensions of tree orders, and those among the chains that exhibit a
simple greedy property correspond precisely to executions of the Huffman
algorithm.
