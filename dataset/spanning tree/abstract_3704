We describe a novel algorithm for noisy global optimisation and
continuum-armed bandits, with good convergence properties over any continuous
reward function having finitely many polynomial maxima. Over such functions,
our algorithm achieves square-root cumulative regret in bandits, and
inverse-square-root error in optimisation, without prior information.
  Our algorithm works by reducing these problems to tree-armed bandits, and we
also provide new results in this setting. We show it is possible to adaptively
combine multiple trees so as to minimise the regret, and also give
near-matching lower bounds on the regret in terms of the zooming dimension.
