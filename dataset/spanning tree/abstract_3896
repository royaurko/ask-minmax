In this paper, we study the signed total domination number in graphs and
present new sharp lower and upper bounds for this parameter. For example by
making use of the classic theorem of Turan, we present a sharp lower bound on
this parameter for graphs with no complete graph of order r+1 as a subgraph.
Also, we prove that n-2(s-s') is an upper bound on the signed total domination
number of any tree of order n with s support vertices and s' support vertives
of degree two. Moreover, we characterize all trees attainig this bound.
