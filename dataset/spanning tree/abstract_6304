We prove that there is an isomorphism between the Hopf Algebra of Feynman
diagrams and the Hopf algebra corresponding to the Homogenous Multiple Zeta
Value ring H in C<<X,Y>> . In other words, Feynman diagrams evaluate to
Multiple Zeta Values in all cases. This proves a recent conjecture of
Connes-Kreimer, and others including Broadhurst and Kontsevich.
  The key step of our theorem is to present the Selberg integral as discussed
in Terasoma [22] as a Functional from the Rooted Trees Operad to the Hopf
algebra of Multiple Zeta Values. This is a new construction which provides
illumination to the relations between zeta values, associators, Feynman
diagrams and moduli spaces.
  An immediate implication of our Main Theorem is that by applying Terasoma's
result and using the construction of our Selberg integral-rooted trees
functional, we prove that the Hermitian matrix integral as discussed in Mulase
[18] evaluates to a Multiple Zeta Value in all 3 cases:
  Asymptotically, the Limit as N goes to infinity, and in general.
  Furthermore, this construction provides for a positive resolution to
Goncharov's conjecture (see [7] pg. 30). The Selberg integral functional can be
extended to map the special values to depth m multiple polylogarithms on X.
