We present space-efficient parallel strategies for two fundamental
combinatorial search problems, namely, backtrack search and branch-and-bound,
both involving the visit of an $n$-node tree of height $h$ under the assumption
that a node can be accessed only through its father or its children. For both
problems we propose efficient algorithms that run on a $p$-processor
distributed-memory machine. For backtrack search, we give a deterministic
algorithm running in $O(n/p+h\log p)$ time, and a Las Vegas algorithm requiring
optimal $O(n/p+h)$ time, with high probability. Building on the backtrack
search algorithm, we also derive a Las Vegas algorithm for branch-and-bound
which runs in $O((n/p+h\log p \log n)h\log^2 n)$ time, with high probability. A
remarkable feature of our algorithms is the use of only constant space per
processor, which constitutes a significant improvement upon previous algorithms
whose space requirements per processor depend on the (possibly huge) tree to be
explored.
