Acting on time-critical events by processing ever growing social media or
news streams is a major technical challenge. Many of these data sources can be
modeled as multi-relational graphs. Continuous queries or techniques to search
for rare events that typically arise in monitoring applications have been
studied extensively for relational databases. This work is dedicated to answer
the question that emerges naturally: how can we efficiently execute a
continuous query on a dynamic graph? This paper presents an exact subgraph
search algorithm that exploits the temporal characteristics of representative
queries for online news or social media monitoring. The algorithm is based on a
novel data structure called the Subgraph Join Tree (SJ-Tree) that leverages the
structural and semantic characteristics of the underlying multi-relational
graph. The paper concludes with extensive experimentation on several real-world
datasets that demonstrates the validity of this approach.
