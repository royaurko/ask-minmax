We examine the late time behavior of the Bunch-Davies wavefunction for
interacting light fields in a de Sitter background. We use perturbative
techniques developed in the framework of AdS/CFT, and analytically continue to
compute tree and loop level contributions to the Bunch-Davies wavefunction. We
consider self-interacting scalars of general mass, but focus especially on the
massless and conformally coupled cases. We show that certain contributions grow
logarithmically in conformal time both at tree and loop level. We also consider
gauge fields and gravitons. The four-dimensional Fefferman-Graham expansion of
classical asymptotically de Sitter solutions is used to show that the
wavefunction contains no logarithmic growth in the pure graviton sector at tree
level. Finally, assuming a holographic relation between the wavefunction and
the partition function of a conformal field theory, we interpret the
logarithmic growths in the language of conformal field theory.
