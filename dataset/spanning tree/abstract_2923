Attack--defense trees are used to describe security weaknesses of a system
and possible countermeasures. In this paper, the connection between
attack--defense trees and game theory is made explicit. We show that
attack--defense trees and binary zero-sum two-player extensive form games have
equivalent expressive power when considering satisfiability, in the sense that
they can be converted into each other while preserving their outcome and their
internal structure.
