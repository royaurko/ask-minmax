We present a new method for inferring species trees from multi-copy gene
trees. Our method is based on a generalization of the Robinson-Foulds (RF)
distance to multi-labeled trees (mul-trees), i.e., gene trees in which multiple
leaves can have the same label. Unlike most previous phylogenetic methods using
gene trees, this method does not assume that gene tree incongruence is caused
by a single, specific biological process, such as gene duplication and loss,
deep coalescence, or lateral gene transfer. We prove that it is NP-hard to
compute the RF distance between two mul-trees, but it is easy to calculate the
generalized RF distance between a mul-tree and a singly-labeled tree. Motivated
by this observation, we formulate the RF supertree problem for mul-trees
(MulRF), which takes a collection of mul-trees and constructs a species tree
that minimizes the total RF distance from the input mul-trees. We present a
fast heuristic algorithm for the MulRF supertree problem. Simulation
experiments demonstrate that the MulRF method produces more accurate species
trees than gene tree parsimony methods when incongruence is caused by gene tree
error, duplications and losses, and/or lateral gene transfer. Furthermore, the
MulRF heuristic runs quickly on data sets containing hundreds of trees with up
to a hundred taxa.
