Let $A$ be a $C^{*}$ algebra and $T: A\rightarrow A$ be a symmetric linear
map which satisfies in functional equation $T(x)T(y)=T^{2}(xy)$. We prove that
under each of the following conditions, $T$ must be the trivial map
$T(x)=\lambda x$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}: $A$ is a simple
$C^{*}$-algebra.
  $A$ is unital with trivial center and has a faithful trace such that each
zero-trace element lies in the closure of the span of commutator elements.
$A=B(H)$ where H is a separable Hilbert space.
