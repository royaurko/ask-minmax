In this paper, we address the question of comparison between populations of
trees. We study an statistical test based on the distance between empirical
mean trees, as an analog of the two sample z statistic for comparing two means.
Despite its simplicity, we can report that the test is quite powerful to
separate distributions with different means but it does not distinguish between
different populations with the same mean, a more complicated test should be
applied in that setting. The performance of the test is studied via simulations
on Galton-Watson branching processes. We also show an application to a real
data problem in genomics.
