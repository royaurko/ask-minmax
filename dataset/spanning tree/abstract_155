We say that two graphs are similar if their adjacency matrices are similar
matrices. We show that the square grid $G_n$ of order $n$ is similar to the
disjoint union of two copies of the quartered Aztec diamond $QAD_{n-1}$ of
order $n-1$ with the path $P_n^{(2)}$ on $n$ vertices having edge weights equal
to~2. Our proof is based on an explicit change of basis in the vector space on
which the adjacency matrix acts. The arguments verifying that this change of
basis works are combinatorial. In particular, this allows computing the number
of spanning trees of quartered Aztec diamonds.
  We present and analyze three more families of graphs that share the above
described ``linear squarishness'' property of square grids: odd Aztec diamonds,
mixed Aztec diamonds, and Aztec pillowcases--graphs obtained from two copies of
an Aztec diamond by identifying the corresponding vertices on their convex
hulls.
  We apply the above results to enumerate all the symmetry classes of spanning
trees of the even Aztec diamonds, and all the symmetry classes not involving
rotations of the spanning trees of odd and mixed Aztec diamonds. We also
enumerate all but the base case of the symmetry classes of perfect matchings of
odd square grids with the central vertex removed. In addition, we obtain a
product formula for the number of spanning trees of Aztec pillowcases.
