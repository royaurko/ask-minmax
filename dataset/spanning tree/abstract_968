A family of binary sequences is presented and proved to have optimal
correlation property and large linear span. It includes the small set of Kasami
sequences, No sequence set and TN sequence set as special cases. An explicit
lower bound expression on the linear span of sequences in the family is given.
With suitable choices of parameters, it is proved that the family has
exponentially larger linear spans than both No sequences and TN sequences. A
class of ideal autocorrelation sequences is also constructed and proved to have
large linear span.
