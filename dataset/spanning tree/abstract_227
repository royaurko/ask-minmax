Consider a homogeneous Poisson point process in a compact convex set in
$d$-dimensional Euclidean space which has interior points and contains the
origin. The radial spanning tree is constructed by connecting each point of the
Poisson point process with its nearest neighbour that is closer to the origin.
For increasing intensity of the underlying Poisson point process the paper
provides expectation and variance asymptotics as well as central limit theorems
with rates of convergence for a class of edge functionals including the total
edge length.
