The uniform spanning forest (USF) in Z^d is the weak limit of random,
uniformly chosen, spanning trees in [-n,n]^d. Pemantle proved that the USF
consists a.s. of a single tree if and only if d <= 4. We prove that any two
components of the USF in Z^d are adjacent a.s. if 5 <= d <= 8, but not if d >=
9. More generally, let N(x,y) be the minimum number of edges outside the USF in
a path joining x and y in Z^d. Then a.s. max{N(x,y) : x,y in Z^d} is the
integer part of (d-1)/4. The notion of stochastic dimension for random
relations in the lattice is introduced and used in the proof.
