In this lecture we summarize recent calculations pointing to the possible
ultraviolet finiteness of N = 8 supergravity in four dimensions. We outline the
modern unitarity method, which enables multiloop calculations in this theory
and allows us to exploit a remarkable relation between tree-level gravity and
gauge-theory amplitudes. We also describe a link between observed cancellations
at loop level and improved behavior of tree-level amplitudes under large
complex deformations of momenta.
