We present a distributed algorithm to compute the first homology of a
simplicial complex. Such algorithms are very useful in topological analysis of
sensor networks, such as its coverage properties. We employ spanning trees to
compute a basis for algebraic 1-cycles, and then use harmonics to efficiently
identify the contractible and homologous cycles. The computational complexity
of the algorithm is $O(|P|^\omega)$, where $|P|$ is much smaller than the
number of edges, and $\omega$ is the complexity order of matrix multiplication.
For geometric graphs, we show using simulations that $|P|$ is very close to the
first Betti number.
