In this paper we discuss reconstruction problems for graphs. We develop some
new ideas like isomorphic extension of isomorphic graphs, partitioning of
vertex sets into sets of equivalent points, subdeck property, etc. and develop
an approach to deal with reconstruction problem. We then discuss complete sets
of invariants for graphs and reconstruction conjecture. We then begin with
development of few equivalent formulations of reconstruction conjecture. In the
last section we briefly elaborate the formulation due to Harary its exact
demand and finally proceed to give a different proof of reconstruction
conjecture using reconstructibility of graph from its spanning trees and
reconstructibility of tree from its pendant point deleted deck of subtrees.
This last proof can be used to develop a systematic procedure to reconstruct
unique graph from its deck.
