We address the problem of the joint statistical inference of phylogenetic
trees and multiple sequence alignments from unaligned molecular sequences. This
problem is generally formulated in terms of string-valued evolutionary
processes along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. The classical evolutionary
process, the TKF91 model, is a continuous-time Markov chain model comprised of
insertion, deletion and substitution events. Unfortunately this model gives
rise to an intractable computational problem---the computation of the marginal
likelihood under the TKF91 model is exponential in the number of taxa. In this
work, we present a new stochastic process, the Poisson Indel Process (PIP), in
which the complexity of this computation is reduced to linear. The new model is
closely related to the TKF91 model, differing only in its treatment of
insertions, but the new model has a global characterization as a Poisson
process on the phylogeny. Standard results for Poisson processes allow key
computations to be decoupled, which yields the favorable computational profile
of inference under the PIP model. We present illustrative experiments in which
Bayesian inference under the PIP model is compared to separate inference of
phylogenies and alignments.
