We define coined Quantum Walks on the infinite rooted binary tree given by
unitary operators $U(C)$ on an associated infinite dimensional Hilbert space,
depending on a unitary coin matrix $C\in U(3)$, and study their spectral
properties. For circulant unitary coin matrices $C$, we derive an equation for
the Carath\'eodory function associated to the spectral measure of a cyclic
vector for $U(C)$. This allows us to show that for all circulant unitary coin
matrices, the spectrum of the Quantum Walk has no singular continuous
component. Furthermore, for coin matrices $C$ which are orthogonal circulant
matrices, we show that the spectrum of the Quantum Walk is absolutely
continuous, except for four coin matrices for which the spectrum of $U(C)$ is
pure point.
