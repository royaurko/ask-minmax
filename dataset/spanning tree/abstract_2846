We here explore a ``fully'' lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar for discourse
that takes the basic elements of a (monologic) discourse to be not simply
clauses, but larger structures that are anchored on variously realized
discourse cues. This link with intra-sentential grammar suggests an account for
different patterns of discourse cues, while the different structures and
operations suggest three separate sources for elements of discourse meaning:
(1) a compositional semantics tied to the basic trees and operations; (2) a
presuppositional semantics carried by cue phrases that freely adjoin to trees;
and (3) general inference, that draws additional, defeasible conclusions that
flesh out what is conveyed compositionally.
