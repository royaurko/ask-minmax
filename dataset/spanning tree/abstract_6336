We present a simplified version of the DFS-based Left-Right planarity testing
and embedding algorithm implemented in Pigale which has been considered as the
fastest implemented one [J.M. Boyer, P.F. Cortese, M. Patrignani, and G. Di
Battista. Stop minding your P's and Q's: implementing fast and simple DFS-based
planarity and embedding algorithm. In Graph Drawing, volume 2912 of Lecture
Notes in Computer Science, pages 25-36. Springer, 2004.]. We give here a simple
full justification of the algorithm, based on a preliminary extended study of
topological properties of DFS trees.
