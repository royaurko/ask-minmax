In this paper we present a CAT generation algorithm for Dyck paths with a
fixed length n. It is the formalization of a method for the exhaustive
generation of this kind of paths which can be described by means of two
equivalent strategies. The former is described by a rooted tree, the latter
lists the paths by means of three operations which, as we are going to see, are
equivalent to visit the tree. These constructions are strictly connected with
ECO method and can be encoded by a rule, very similar to the succession rule in
ECO, with a finite number of labels for each n. Moreover with a slight
variation this method can be generalized to other combinatorial classes like
Grand Dyck or Motzkin paths.
