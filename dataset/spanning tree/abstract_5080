Current-induced domain-wall motion with velocity spanning over five orders of
magnitude up to 22 m/s has been observed by magneto-optical Kerr effect in
(Ga,Mn)As with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The data are employed to
verify theories of spin-transfer by the Slonczewski-like mechanism as well as
by the torque resulting from spin-flip transitions in the domain-wall region.
Evidence for domain-wall creep at low currents is found.
