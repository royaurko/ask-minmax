The underlying reality of a succession of interbreeding populations is a
vastly complicated network N. Since Darwin, species trees have been used as a
simplified description of the relationships which summarize the overly
complicated network N. Recent evidence of hybridization and lateral gene
transfer, however, suggest that there are situations where trees are
inadequate. Consequently it is important to determine properties that
characterize networks closely related to N and possibly more complicated than
trees but lacking the full complexity of N. A connected surjective digraph map
(CSD) is a map f from one network N to another network M which either collapses
an arc to a single point or takes an arc to an arc, which is surjective, and
such that the inverse image of a point is always connected. CSD maps are shown
to behave well under composition. If there is such a CSD map, the network M is
shown to arise naturally as a quotient structure from N. It is proved that if
there is a CSD map from N to M, then there is in a way to lift an undirected
version of M into N, possibly with added resolution. A CSD map from N to M puts
strong constraints on N; if the map were not connected, there would be minimal
constraints. A procedure is defined, given N, to construct a standard
successively cluster-distinct network from N. In general, it may be useful to
study classes of networks such that, for any N, there exists a CSD map from N
to some standard member of that class.
