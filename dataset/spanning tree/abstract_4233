We present a new, explicit formula for all tree-level amplitudes in N=4 super
Yang-Mills. The formula is written as a certain contour integral of the
connected prescription of Witten's twistor string, expressed in link variables.
A very simple deformation of the integrand gives directly the Grassmannian
integrand proposed by Arkani-Hamed et al. together with the explicit contour of
integration. The integral is derived by iteratively adding particles to the
Grassmannian integral, one particle at a time, and makes manifest both parity
and soft limits. The formula is shown to be related to those given by Dolan and
Goddard, and generalizes the results of earlier work for NMHV and N^2MHV to all
N^(k-2)MHV tree amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills.
