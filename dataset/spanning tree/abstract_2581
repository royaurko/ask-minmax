We attempt to answer whether dark-matter galaxies could be formed in a time
span of about $1\, Gyr$ or the age of the young Universe. If the dark-matter
galaxies would exist in a time span of about 1 Gyr, then they might even
dictate the formation of the ordinary-matter galaxies. The implications for the
structure of our Universe would be tremendous. Thus, the search for dark-matter
galaxies should be under way if possible.
