The main substance of the paper concerns the growth rate and the
classification (ergodicity, transience) of a family of random trees. In the
basic model, new edges appear according to a Poisson process of parameter
$\lambda$ and leaves can be deleted at a rate $\mu$. The main results lay the
stress on the famous number $e$. A complete classification of the process is
given in terms of the intensity factor $\rho=\lambda/\mu $: it is ergodic if
$\rho\leq e^{-1}$, and transient if $\rho>e^{-1}$. There is a phase transition
phenomenon: the usual region of null recurrence (in the parameter space) here
does not exist. This fact is rare for countable Markov chains with
exponentially distributed jumps. Some basic stationary laws are computed, e.g.
the number of vertices and the height. Various bounds, limit laws and
ergodic-like theorems are obtained, both for the transient and ergodic regimes.
In particular, when the system is transient, the height of the tree grows
linearly as the time $t\to\infty$, at a rate which is explicitly computed. Some
of the results are extended to the so-called multiclass model.
