We construct an algorithm to simulate imaginary time evolution of
translationally invariant spin systems with local interactions on an infinite,
symmetric tree. We describe the state by symmetric iPEPS and use
translation-invariant operators for the updates at each time step. The
contraction of this tree tensor network can be computed efficiently by
recursion without approximations and one can then truncate all the iPEPS
tensors at the same time. The translational symmetry is preserved at each time
step that makes the algorithm very well conditioned and stable. The
computational cost scales like $O(D^{q+1})$ with the bond dimension $D$ and
coordination number $q$, much favourable than that of the iTEBD on trees [D.

transverse-field Ising model on the Bethe lattice, we find a second order phase
transition with finite correlation lengths.
