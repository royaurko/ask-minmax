A Markov chain is considered whose states are orderings of an underlying
fixed tree and whose transitions are local "random-to-front" reorderings,
driven by a probability distribution on subsets of the leaves. The eigenvalues
of the transition matrix are determined using Brown's theory of random walk on
semigroups.
