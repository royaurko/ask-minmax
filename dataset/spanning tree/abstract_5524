We present a concise review of the experimental developments on neutrino
mixing and their theoretical implications as presented and discussed at this
Conference. The recent data disfavour many models but the surviving ones still
span a wide range going from Anarchy (no structure, no symmetry in the neutrino
sector) to a maximum of symmetry, as for the models based on discrete
non-abelian flavour groups which can be improved following the indications from
the recent data.
