This paper focuses on determining the volumes of permutation polytopes
associated to cyclic groups, dihedral groups, groups of automorphisms of tree
graphs, and Frobenius groups. We do this through the use of triangulations and
the calculation of Ehrhart polynomials. We also present results on the theta
body hierarchy of various permutation polytopes.
