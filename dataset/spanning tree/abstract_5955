In this note we show that the recent conjecture proposed by Cachazo and
Strominger holds at tree level in arbitrary dimensions. The proof makes crucial
use of the fact that the sub-leading operator is defined using the total
angular momentum operator. A key ingredient that makes the proof possible is
the CHY formula for graviton amplitudes in arbitrary number of dimensions.
