Given two rooted, labeled trees $P$ and $T$ the tree path subsequence problem
is to determine which paths in $P$ are subsequences of which paths in $T$. Here
a path begins at the root and ends at a leaf. In this paper we propose this
problem as a useful query primitive for XML data, and provide new algorithms
improving the previously best known time and space bounds.
