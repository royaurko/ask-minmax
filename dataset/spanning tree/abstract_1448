The Horton-Strahler (HS) index $r=\max{(i,j)}+\delta_{i,j}$ has been shown to
be relevant to a number of physical (such at diffusion limited aggregation)
geological (river networks), biological (pulmonary arteries, blood vessels,
various species of trees) and computational (use of registers) applications.
Here we revisit the enumeration problem of the HS index on the rooted,
unlabeled, plane binary set of trees, and enumerate the same index on the
ambilateral set of rooted, plane binary set of trees of $n$ leaves. The
ambilateral set is a set of trees whose elements cannot be obtained from each
other via an arbitrary number of reflections with respect to vertical axes
passing through any of the nodes on the tree. For the unlabeled set we give an
alternate derivation to the existing exact solution. Extending this technique
for the ambilateral set, which is described by an infinite series of non-linear
functional equations, we are able to give a double-exponentially converging
approximant to the generating functions in a neighborhood of their convergence
circle, and derive an explicit asymptotic form for the number of such trees.
