Inspired by the small longitudinal polarizations (LPs) of $B\to K^* \phi$
decays observed by BELLE and BABAR, we revise the theoretical uncertainties of
perturbative QCD approach for determining hard scales of B decays, we find that
the LPs of $B\to K^* \phi$ could approach to 60% while the branching ratios
(BRs) could be around $9\times 10^{-6}$. In addition, we also study the BRs and
polarization fractions of $B\to \rho (\omega) \rho (\omega)$ and $B\to \rho
(\omega) K^*$ decays. For those tree dominant and color-allowed processes in
$B\to \rho (\omega) \rho (\omega)$ decays, we get that the BRs of $(\rho^{+}
\rho^{-}, \rho^{0} \rho^{+}, \omega \rho^{+})$ are $(23.06, 11.99, 
14.78)\times 10^{-6}$ while their LPs are close to unity. Interestingly, due to
significant tree contributions, we find that the BR(LP) of $\rho^{-} K^{*+}$
could be around $10.13 \times 10^{-6}(60%)$; and due to the tree and
electroweak penguin, the BR(LP) of $\omega K^{*+}$ could be around $5.67 \times
10^{-6}(61%)$.
