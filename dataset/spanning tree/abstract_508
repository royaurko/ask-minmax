Plasmodium of Physarym polycephalum is an ideal biological substrate for
implementing concurrent and parallel computation, including combinatorial
geometry and optimization on graphs. We report results of scoping experiments
on Physarum computing in conditions of minimal friction, on the water surface.
We show that plasmodium of Physarum is capable for computing a basic spanning
trees and manipulating of light-weight objects. We speculate that our results
pave the pathways towards design and implementation of amorphous biological
robots.
