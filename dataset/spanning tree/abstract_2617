The renormalized photon and electron propagators are expanded over planar
binary trees. Explicit recurrence solutions are given for the terms of these
expansions. In the case of massless Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the relation
between renormalized and bare expansions is given in terms of a Hopf algebra
structure. For massive quenched QED, the relation between renormalized and bare
expansions is given explicitly.
