The measurement of the Avogadro constant opened the way to a comparison of
the watt-balance measurements of the Planck constant with the values calculated
from the quotients of the Planck constant and the mass of a particle or an
atom. Since the energy scales of these measurements span nine energy decades,
these data provide insight into the consistency of our understanding of
physics.
