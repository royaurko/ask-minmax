Dinits, Karzanov and Lomonosov showed that the minimal edge cuts of a finite
graph have the structure of a cactus, a tree-like graph constructed from
cycles. Evangelidou and Papasoglu extended this to minimal cuts separating the
ends of an infinite graph. In this paper we show that minimal vertex cuts
separating the ends of a graph can be encoded by a succulent, a mild
generalization of a cactus that is still tree-like. We go on to show that the
earlier cactus results follow from our work.
