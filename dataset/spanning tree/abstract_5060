The demagnetization curve, or initial magnetization curve, is studied by
examining the embedded Barkhausen noise using the non-equilibrium, zero
temperature random-field Ising model. The demagnetization curve is found to
reflect the critical point seen as the system's disorder is changed. Critical
scaling is found for avalanche sizes and the size and number of spanning
avalanches. The critical exponents are derived from those related to the
saturation loop and subloops. Finally, the behavior in the presence of long
range demagnetizing fields is discussed. Results are presented for simulations
of up to one million spins.
