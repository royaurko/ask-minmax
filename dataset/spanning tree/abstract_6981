We consider the minimal 3-3-1 model with a heavy scalar sextet and realize,
at the tree level, an effective dimension five interaction that contributes to
the mass of the charged leptons. We give the scalar mass spectra of the model
and analyze under which conditions the fields in the scalar sextet are heavy.
With the effective dimension five operator and a triplet we obtain the correct
charged lepton masses. In this case the neutrino masses arise by a type I
seesaw mechanism and we also show how the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakawaga-Sakata
matrix arises. The conditions under which it is possible to have a stable
vacuum at tree level are also given.
