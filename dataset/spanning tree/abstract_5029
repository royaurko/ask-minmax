We determined ages for 52 star clusters with masses < 10^6 solar masses in
the low surface brightness spiral galaxy NGC 45. Four of these candidates are
old globular clusters located in the bulge. The remaining ones span a large age
range. The cluster ages suggest a continuous star/cluster formation history
without evidence for bursts, consistent with the galaxy being located in a
relatively unperturbed environment in the outskirts of the Sculptor group.
