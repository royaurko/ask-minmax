Cancers follow a clonal Darwinian evolution, with fitter subclones replacing
more quiescent cells, ultimately giving rise to macroscopic disease.
High-throughput genomics provides the opportunity to investigate these
processes and determine specific genetic alterations driving disease
progression. Genomic sampling of a patient's cancer provides a molecular
history, represented by a phylogenetic tree. Cohorts of patients represent a
forest of related phylogenetic structures. To extract clinically relevant
information, one must represent and statistically compare these collections of
trees. We propose a framework based on an application of the work by Billera,
Holmes and Vogtmann on phylogenetic tree spaces to the case of unrooted trees
of intra-individual cancer tissue samples. We observe that these tree spaces
are globally nonpositively curved, allowing for statistical inference on
populations of patient histories. A projective tree space is introduced,
permitting visualizations of aggregate evolutionary behavior. Published data
from three types of human malignancies are explored within our framework.
