We describe a new parallel N-body code for cosmological simulations. The code
is based on a work- and data sharing scheme, and is implemented within the Cray
Research Corporation's CRAFT programming environment. Different data
distribution schemes have been adopted for bodies' and tree's structures. Tests
performed for two different types of initial distributions show that the
performance scales almost ideally as a function of the size of the system and
of the number of processors. We discuss the factors affecting the absolute
speedup and how it can be increased with a better tree's data distribution
scheme.
