Given a diagram of a link K in S^3, we write down a Heegaard diagram for the
branched-double cover Sigma(K). The generators of the associated Heegaard Floer
chain complex correspond to Kauffman states of the link diagram. Using this
model we make some computations of the homology \hat{HF}(Sigma(K)) as a graded
group. We also conjecture the existence of a delta-grading on
\hat{HF}(Sigma(K)) analogous to the delta-grading on knot Floer and Khovanov
homology.
