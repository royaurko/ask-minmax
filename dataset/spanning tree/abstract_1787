Let $\mathcal{T}^{(p)}_n$ be the set of $p$-ary labeled trees on
$\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. A maximal decreasing subtree of an $p$-ary labeled tree is
defined by the maximal $p$-ary subtree from the root with all edges being
decreasing. In this paper, we study a new refinement $\mathcal{T}^{(p)}_{n,k}$
of $\mathcal{T}^{(p)}_n$, which is the set of $p$-ary labeled trees whose
maximal decreasing subtree has $k$ vertices.
