We present efficient algorithms for computing a maximum agreement forest
(MAF) of a pair of multifurcating (nonbinary) rooted trees. Our algorithms
match the running times of the currently best algorithms for the binary case.
The size of an MAF corresponds to the subtree prune-and-regraft (SPR) distance
of the two trees and is intimately connected to their hybridization number.
These distance measures are essential tools for understanding reticulate
evolution, such as lateral gene transfer, recombination, and hybridization.
Multifurcating trees arise naturally as a result of statistical uncertainty in
current tree construction methods.
