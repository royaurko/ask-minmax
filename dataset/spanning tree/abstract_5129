We construct supersymmetric D-brane probe solutions in the background of the
2-charge D1-D5 system on M, where M is either K3 or T^4. We focus on
`near-horizon bound states' that preserve supersymmetries of the near-horizon
AdS_3 x S^3 x M geometry and are static with respect to the global time
coordinate. We find a variety of half-BPS solutions that span an AdS_2 subspace
in AdS_3, carry worldvolume flux and can wrap an S^2 within S^3 and/or
supersymmetric cycles in M.
