The Feynman integral for the Schroedinger propagator is constructed as a
generalized function of white noise, for a linear space of potentials spanned
by measures and Laplace transforms of measures, i.e., locally singular as well
as rapidly growing at infinity. Remarkably, all these propagators admit a
perturbation expansion.
