The fractional perfect b-matching polytope of an undirected graph G is the
polytope of all assignments of nonnegative real numbers to the edges of G such
that the sum of the numbers over all edges incident to any vertex v is a
prescribed nonnegative number b_v. General theorems which provide conditions
for nonemptiness, give a formula for the dimension, and characterize the
vertices, edges and face lattices of such polytopes are obtained. Many of these
results are expressed in terms of certain spanning subgraphs of G which are
associated with subsets or elements of the polytope. For example, it is shown
that an element u of the fractional perfect b-matching polytope of G is a
vertex of the polytope if and only if each component of the graph of u either
is acyclic or else contains exactly one cycle with that cycle having odd
length, where the graph of u is defined to be the spanning subgraph of G whose
edges are those at which u is positive.
