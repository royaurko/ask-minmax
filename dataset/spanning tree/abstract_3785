We derive a link representation for all tree amplitudes in N=8 supergravity,
from a recent conjecture by Cachazo and Skinner. The new formula explicitly
writes amplitudes as contour integrals over constrained link variables, with an
integrand naturally expressed in terms of determinants, or equivalently tree
diagrams. Important symmetries of the amplitude, such as supersymmetry, parity
and (partial) permutation invariance, are kept manifest in the formulation. We
also comment on rewriting the formula in a GL(k)-invariant manner, which may
serve as a starting point for the generalization to possible Grassmannian
contour integrals.
