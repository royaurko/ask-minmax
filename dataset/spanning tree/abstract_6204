Focusing on a simple three neutrino oscillation scenario motivated by the
recent Super-Kamiokande result, we discuss both tree-level and 1-loop
contributions to neutrino masses in supersymmetry without R-parity, aiming at
discerning the flavor structure issues of the theory. The single-VEV
parametrization framework, which allows the first consistent treatment of the
bilinear and trilinear R-parity violating terms, and hence the tree and 1-loop
contributions, without any assumption on the nature of R-parity violation.
Though the very small neutrino masses implies stringent suppressions of the
relevant R-parity violating couplings, we show that there is still room for
understanding the suppressions as a simple consequence of the general flavor
hierarchy.
