We extend the Markov chain tree theorem to general commutative semirings, and
we generalize the state reduction algorithm to commutative semifields. This
leads to a new universal algorithm, whose prototype is the state reduction
algorithm which computes the Markov chain tree vector of a stochastic matrix.
