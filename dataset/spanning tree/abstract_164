Let x and y be chosen uniformly in a graph G. We find the limiting
distribution of the length of a loop-erased random walk from x to y on a large
class of graphs that include the discrete torus in dimensions 5 and above.
Moreover, on this family of graphs we show that a suitably normalized
finite-dimensional scaling limit of the uniform spanning tree is a Brownian
continuum random tree.
