We define secure operations with tree-formed, protected verification data
registers. Functionality is conceptually added to Trusted Platform Modules
(TPMs) to handle Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) which represent roots
of hash trees protecting the integrity of tree-formed Stored Measurement Logs
(SMLs). This enables verification and update of an inner node of an SML and
even attestation to its value with the same security level as for ordinary
PCRs. As an important application, it is shown how certification of SML
subtrees enables attestation of platform properties.
