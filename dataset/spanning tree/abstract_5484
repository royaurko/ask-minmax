For alloy thermodynamics, we obtain unique, physical effective cluster
interactions (ECI) from truncated cluster expansions (CE) via
subspace-projection from a complete configurational Hilbert space; structures
form a (sub)space spanned by a locally complete set of cluster functions.
Subspace-projection is extended using Fractional Factorial Design with subspace
"augmentation" to remove systematically the ECI linear dependencies due to
excluded cluster functions - controlling convergence and bias error, with a
dramatic reduction in the number of structural energies needed. No statistical
fitting is required. We illustrate the formalism for a simple Hamiltonian and
Ag-Au alloys using density-functional theory.
