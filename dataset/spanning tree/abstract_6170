We show how VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) can provide potentially
powerful insight into the 3x + 1 problem via the introduction of a unique
geometrical object, called the 'G-cell', akin to a fractal generator. We
present an example of a VRML world developed programmatically with the G-cell.
The role of VRML as a tool for furthering the understanding the 3x+1 problem is
potentially significant for several reasons: a) VRML permits the observer to
zoom into the geometric structure at all scales (up to limitations of the
computing platform). b) VRML enables rotation to alter comparative visual
perspective (similar to Tukey's data-spinning concept). c) VRML facilitates the
demonstration of interesting tree features between collaborators on the
internet who might otherwise have difficulty conveying their ideas
unambiguously. d) VRML promises to reveal any dimensional dependencies among
3x+1 sequences.
