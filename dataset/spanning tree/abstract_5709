We explicitly compute the Compton amplitude for the scattering of a photon
and a (massless) ``electron/positron'' at tree level and one loop, in a
four-dimensional fermionic heterotic string model. We comment on the
relationship between the amplitudes we compute in string theory and the
corresponding ones in field theory.
