We provide a constructive characterization of the trees for which the Roman
domination number strongly equals the weak Roman domination number, that is,
for which every weak Roman dominating function of minimum weight is a Roman
dominating function. Our characterization is based on five simple extension
operations, and reveals several structural properties of these trees.
