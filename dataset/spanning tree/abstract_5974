We study finitary $2$-categories associated to dual projection functors for
finite dimensional associative algebras. In the case of path algebras of
admissible tree quivers (which includes all Dynkin quivers of type $A$) we show
that the monoid generated by dual projection functors is the Hecke-Kiselman
monoid of the underlying quiver and also obtain a presentation for the monoid
of indecomposable subbimodules of the identity bimodule.
