The reconstruction of a central tendency `species tree' from a large number
of conflicting gene trees is a central problem in systematic biology. Moreover,
it becomes particularly problematic when taxon coverage is patchy, so that not
all taxa are present in every gene tree. Here, we list four desirable
properties that a method for estimating a species tree from gene trees should
have. We show that while these can be achieved when taxon coverage is complete
(by the Adams consensus method), they cannot all be satisfied in the more
general setting of partial taxon coverage.
