In a series of four papers we prove the following relaxation of the
Loebl-Komlos-Sos Conjecture: For every $\alpha>0$ there exists a number $k_0$
such that for every $k>k_0$ every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with at least
$(\frac12+\alpha)n$ vertices of degree at least $(1+\alpha)k$ contains each
tree $T$ of order $k$ as a subgraph.
  The method to prove our result follows a strategy similar to approaches that
employ the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma: we decompose the graph $G$, find a
suitable combinatorial structure inside the decomposition, and then embed the
tree $T$ into $G$ using this structure. Since for sparse graphs $G$, the
decomposition given by the regularity lemma is not helpful, we use a more
general decomposition technique. We show that each graph can be decomposed into
vertices of huge degree, regular pairs (in the sense of the regularity lemma),
and two other objects each exhibiting certain expansion properties. In this
paper, we introduce this novel decomposition technique. In the three follow-up
papers, we find a combinatorial structure suitable inside the decomposition,
which we then use for embedding the tree.
