Pipage rounding is a dependent random sampling technique that has several
interesting properties and diverse applications. One property that has been
particularly useful is negative correlation of the resulting vector.
Unfortunately negative correlation has its limitations, and there are some
further desirable properties that do not seem to follow from existing
techniques. In particular, recent concentration results for sums of independent
random matrices are not known to extend to a negatively dependent setting.
  We introduce a simple but useful technique called concavity of pessimistic
estimators. This technique allows us to show concentration of submodular
functions and concentration of matrix sums under pipage rounding. The former
result answers a question of Chekuri et al. (2009). To prove the latter result,
we derive a new variant of Lieb's celebrated concavity theorem in matrix
analysis.
  We provide numerous applications of these results. One is to spectrally-thin
trees, a spectral analog of the thin trees that played a crucial role in the
recent breakthrough on the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. We show a
polynomial time algorithm that, given a graph where every edge has effective
conductance at least $\kappa$, returns an $O(\kappa^{-1} \cdot \log n / \log
\log n)$-spectrally-thin tree. There are further applications to rounding of
semidefinite programs, to the column subset selection problem, and to a
geometric question of extracting a nearly-orthonormal basis from an isotropic
distribution.
