The subject of the paper are Schr\"odinger operators on tree graphs which are
radial having the branching number $b_n$ at all the vertices at the distance
$t_n$ from the root. We consider a family of coupling conditions at the
vertices characterized by $(b_n-1)^2+4$ real parameters. We prove that if the
graph is sparse so that there is a subsequence of $\{t_{n+1}-t_n\}$ growing to
infinity, in the absence of the potential the absolutely continuous spectrum is
empty for a large subset of these vertex couplings, but on the the other hand,
there are cases when the spectrum of such a Schr\"odinger operator can be
purely absolutely continuous.
