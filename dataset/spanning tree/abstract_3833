We reconstruct the year of publication of each cuneiform tablet of the Nuzi
society in ancient Mesopotamia. The tablets, are on land transaction, marriage,
loan, slavery contracts etc. The number of tablets seem to increase by logistic
growth until saturation. It may show the dynamics of concentration of lands or
other properties into few powerful families in a period of about twenty years.
We reconstruct family trees and social networks of Nuzi and estimate the
publication years of cuneiform tablets consistently with the trees and
networks, formulating least squares problems with linear inequality
constraints.
