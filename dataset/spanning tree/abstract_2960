Suppose G is a tree. Graham's "Tree Reconstruction Conjecture" states that G
is uniquely determined by the integer sequence |G|, |L(G)|, |L(L(G))|,
|L(L(L(G)))|, ..., where L(H) denotes the line graph of the graph H. Little is
known about this question apart from a few simple observations. We show that
the number of trees on n vertices which can be distinguished by their
associated integer sequences is at least exp(c(log n)^(3/2)). The proof
strategy involves constructing a large collection of caterpillar graphs using
partitions arising from the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem. We identify, but only
partially resolve, an interesting question about representations of integers as
sums of k-th powers of the parts of integer partitions.
