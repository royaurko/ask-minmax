Using a recently developed algorithm for generic rigidity of two-dimensional
graphs, we analyze rigidity and connectivity percolation transitions in two
dimensions on lattices of linear size up to L=4096. We compare three different
universality classes: The generic rigidity class; the connectivity class and;
the generic ``braced square net''(GBSN). We analyze the spanning cluster
density P_\infty, the backbone density P_B and the density of dangling ends
P_D. In the generic rigidity and connectivity cases, the load-carrying
component of the spanning cluster, the backbone, is fractal at p_c, so that the
backbone density behaves as B ~ (p-p_c)^{\beta'} for p>p_c. We estimate
\beta'_{gr} = 0.25 +/- 0.02 for generic rigidity and \beta'_c = 0.467 +/- 0.007
for the connectivity case. We find the correlation length exponents, \nu_{gr} =
1.16 +/- 0.03 for generic rigidity compared to the exact value for connectivity
\nu_c = 4/3. In contrast the GBSN undergoes a first-order rigidity transition,
with the backbone density being extensive at p_c, and undergoing a jump
discontinuity on reducing p across the transition. We define a model which
tunes continuously between the GBSN and GR classes and show that the GR class
is typical.
