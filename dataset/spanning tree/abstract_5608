We report on GalevNB (Galev for N-Body simulations), an integrated software
solution that provides N-body users direct access to the software package GALEV
(GALaxy EVolutionary synthesis models). GalevNB is developed for the purpose of
a direct comparison between N-body simulations and observations. It converts
the fundamental stellar properties of N-body simulations, i.e., stellar mass,
temperature, stellar luminosity and metallicity, into observational magnitudes
for a variety of filters of widely used instruments/telescopes (HST, ESO, SDSS,
2MASS), and into spectra that span from far-UV (90 $\rm \AA$) to near-IR (160
$\rm \mu$m).
