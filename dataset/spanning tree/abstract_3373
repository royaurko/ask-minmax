This paper presents a unified approach to parsing, in which top-down,
bottom-up and left-corner parsers are related to preorder, postorder and
inorder tree traversals. It is shown that the simplest bottom-up and
left-corner parsers are left recursive and must be converted using an extended
Greibach normal form. With further partial execution, the bottom-up and
left-corner parsers collapse together as in the BUP parser of Matsumoto.
