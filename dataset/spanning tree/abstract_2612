We give a systematic way to compute higher orders in the 1/m_b expansion in
inclusive semi-leptonic decays at tree level. We reproduce the known 1/m_b^3
terms and compute the 1/m_b^4 terms at tree level. The appearing
non-perturbative parameters and the impact on the determination of V_{cb} are
discussed.
