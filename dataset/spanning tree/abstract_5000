We analyze asymmetries in the gas rotation curves of 113 galaxies drawn from
the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey, spanning a broad range of luminosities and
morphologies. If the origin of the rotation curve is chosen to minimize the
asymmetry, then ~23% of sample galaxies show asymmetry >5% within 1.3r_e.
However, not all gas kinematic asymmetries indicate asymmetries in the
underlying potential.
