Data mining techniques have been widely used in various applications. Binary
search tree based frequent items is an effective method for automatically
recognize the most frequent items, least frequent items and average frequent
items. This paper presents a new approach in order to find out frequent items.
The word frequent item refers to how many times the item appeared in the given
input. This approach is used to find out item sets in any order using familiar
approach binary search tree. The method adapted here is in order to find out
frequent items by comparing and incrementing the counter variable in existing
transactional data base or text data. We are also representing different
approaches in frequent item sets and also propose an algorithmic approach for
the problem solving
