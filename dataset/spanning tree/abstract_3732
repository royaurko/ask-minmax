We study vacancy diffusion on the classical triangular lattice dimer model,
sub ject to the kinetic constraint that dimers can only translate, but not
rotate. A single vacancy, i.e. a monomer, in an otherwise fully packed lattice,
is always localized in a tree-like structure. The distribution of tree sizes is
asymptotically exponential and has an average of 8.16 \pm 0.01 sites. A
connected pair of monomers has a finite probability of being delocalized. When
delocalized, the diffusion of monomers is anomalous:
