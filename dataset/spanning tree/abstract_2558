An exact formula is given for the probability that there exists a spanning
cluster between opposite boundaries of an annulus, in the scaling limit of
critical percolation. The entire distribution function for the number of
distinct spanning clusters is also given. These results are found using Coulomb
gas methods. Their forms are compared with the expectations of conformal field
theory.
