A nonminimal interaction of the gluon field with a massive antisymmetric
tensor order parameter is shown to yield a vanishing dielectric function at
tree level. The London-type description of this perfect diaelectric suggests a
tractable non-Abelian chromodynamics of the Ginzburg-Landau type which is
suitable for describing the confinement-deconfinement phase transition.
