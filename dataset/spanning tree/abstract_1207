We introduce the notion of a hereditary property for rooted real trees and we
also consider reduction of trees by a given hereditary property. Leaf-length
erasure, also called trimming, is included as a special case of hereditary
reduction. We only consider the metric structure of trees, and our framework is
the space $\bT$ of pointed isometry classes of locally compact rooted real
trees equipped with the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Some of the main results of
the paper are a general tightness criterion in $\bT$ and limit theorems for
growing families of trees. We apply these results to Galton-Watson trees with
exponentially distributed edge lengths. This class is preserved by hereditary
reduction. Then we consider families of such Galton-Watson trees that are
consistent under hereditary reduction and that we call growth processes. We
prove that the associated families of offspring distributions are completely
characterised by the branching mechanism of a continuous-state branching
process. We also prove that such growth processes converge to Levy forests. As
a by-product of this convergence, we obtain a characterisation of the laws of
Levy forests in terms of leaf-length erasure and we obtain invariance
principles for discrete Galton-Watson trees, including the super-critical
cases.
