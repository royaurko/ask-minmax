Graphene's low-energy electronic excitations obey a 2+1 dimensional Dirac
Hamiltonian. After extending this Hamiltonian to include interactions with a
quantized electromagnetic field, we calculate the amplitude associated with the
simplest, tree-level Feynman diagram: the vertex connecting a photon with two
electrons. This amplitude leads to analytic expressions for the 3D angular
dependence of photon emission, the photon-mediated electron-hole recombination
rate, and corrections to graphene's opacity $\pi \alpha$ and dynamic
conductivity $\pi e^2/2 h$ for situations away from thermal equilibrium, as
would occur in a graphene laser. We find that Ohmic dissipation in perfect
graphene can be attributed to spontaneous emission.
