An analytical theory for the efficiency of particle extraction from an
accelerator by means of a bent crystal is proposed. The theory agrees with all
the measurements performed in the broad energy range of 14 to 900 GeV, where
the efficiency range also spans over two decades, from 0.3% to 30%.
Possibilities for crystal extraction from sub-GeV accelerators and from muon
colliders are discussed.
