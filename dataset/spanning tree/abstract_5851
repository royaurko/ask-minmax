These lectures, presented at TASI 08 school, provide an introduction to
supersymmetry and supersymmetry breaking. We present basic formalism of
supersymmetry, supersymmetric non-renormalization theorems, and summarize
non-perturbative dynamics of supersymmetric QCD. We then turn to discussion of
tree level, non-perturbative, and metastable supersymmetry breaking. We
introduce Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and discuss soft parameters in
the Lagrangian. Finally we discuss several mechanisms for communicating the
supersymmetry breaking between the hidden and visible sectors.
