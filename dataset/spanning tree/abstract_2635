This paper follows from two earlier works. In the first we gave an explicit
construction of opetopes, the underlying cell shapes in the theory of opetopic
n-categories; at the heart of this construction is the use of certain trees. In
the second we gave a description of trees using Kelly-Mac Lane graphs. In the
present paper we apply the latter to the former, to give a construction of
opetopes using Kelly-Mac Lane graphs.
