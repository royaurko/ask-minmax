For a fixed graph H with t vertices, an H-factor of a graph G with n
vertices, where t divides n, is a collection of vertex disjoint (not
necessarily induced) copies of H in G covering all vertices of G. We prove that
for a fixed tree T on t vertices and \epsilon > 0, the random graph G_{n,p},
with n a multiple of t, with high probability contains a family of
edge-disjoint T-factors covering all but an \epsilon-fraction of its edges, as
long as \epsilon^4 n p >> (log n)^2. Assuming stronger divisibility conditions,
the edge probability can be taken down to p > (C log n)/n. A similar packing
result is proved also for pseudo-random graphs, defined in terms of their
degrees and co-degrees.
