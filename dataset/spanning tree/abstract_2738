We obtain the maximum sum-connectivity indices of graphs in the set of trees
and in the set of unicyclic graphs respectively with given number of vertices
and maximum degree, and determine the corresponding extremal graphs.
Additionally, we deduce the n-vertex unicyclic graphs with the first two
maximum sum-connectivity indices for $n\ge 4$.
