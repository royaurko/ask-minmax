Correlation matrices inferred from stock return time series contain
information on the behaviour of the market, especially on clusters of highly
correlating stocks. Here we study a subset of New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
traded stocks and compare three different methods of analysis: i) spectral
analysis, i.e. investigation of the eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs of the
correlation matrix, ii) asset trees, obtained by constructing the maximal
spanning tree of the correlation matrix, and iii) asset graphs, which are
networks in which the strongest correlations are depicted as edges. We
illustrate and discuss the localisation of the most significant modes of
fluctuation, i.e. eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues, on the
asset trees and graphs.
