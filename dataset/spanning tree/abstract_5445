Motivated by the definition of the edge elimination polynomial of a graph we
define the covered components polynomial counting spanning subgraphs with
respect to their number of components, edges and covered components. We prove a
recurrence relation, which shows that both graph polynomials are substitution
instances of each other. We give some properties of the covered components
polynomial and some results concerning relations to other graph polynomials.
