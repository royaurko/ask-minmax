We compute the electroweak (EW) contributions to squark--squark pair
production processes at the LHC within the framework of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Both tree-level EW contributions, of
O(alpha_s alpha + alpha^2), and next-to-leading order (NLO) EW corrections, of
O(alpha_s^2 alpha), are calculated. Depending on the flavor and chirality of
the produced quarks, many interferences between EW-mediated and QCD-mediated
diagrams give non-zero contributions at tree-level and NLO. We discuss the
computational techniques and present an extensive numerical analysis for
inclusive squark--squark production as well as for subsets and single
processes. While the tree-level EW contributions to the integrated cross
sections can reach the 20% level, the NLO EW corrections typically lower the LO
prediction by a few percent.
