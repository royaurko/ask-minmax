Continuing the program begun by the contributors in a previous paper, we develop
an exact low-density expansion for the random minimum spanning tree (MST) on a
finite graph, and use it to develop a continuum perturbation expansion for the
MST on critical percolation clusters in space dimension d. The perturbation
expansion is proved to be renormalizable in d=6 dimensions. We consider the
fractal dimension D_p of paths on the latter MST; our previous results lead us
to predict that D_p=2 for d>d_c=6. Using a renormalization-group approach, we
confirm the result for d>6, and calculate D_p to first order in \epsilon=6-d
for d\leq 6 using the connection with critical percolation, with the result D_p
= 2 - \epsilon/7 + O(\epsilon^2).
