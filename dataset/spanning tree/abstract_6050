We present the results of a two-year, multisite observing campaign
investigating the high-amplitude delta Scuti star VX Hydrae during the 2006 and
2007 observing seasons. The final data set consists of nearly 8500 V-band
observations spanning HJD 2453763.6 to 2454212.7 (2006 January 28 to 2007 April
22). Separate analyses of the two individual seasons of data yield 25
confidently-detected frequencies common to both data sets, of which two are
pulsation modes, and the remaining 23 are Fourier harmonics or beat frequencies
of these two modes. The 2006 data set had five additional frequencies with
amplitudes less than 1.5 mmag, and the 2007 data had one additional frequency.
Analysis of the full 2006-2007 data set yields 22 of the 25 frequencies found
in the individual seasons of data. There are no significant peaks in the
spectrum other than these between 0 and 60 c/d. The frequencies of the two main
pulsation modes derived from the 2006 and 2007 observing seasons individually
do not differ at the level of 3-sigma, and thus we find no conclusive evidence
for period change over the span of these observations. However, the amplitude
of f(1) = 5.7898 c/d changed significantly between the two seasons, while the
amplitude of f(0) = 4.4765 c/d remained constant; amplitudes of the Fourier
harmonics and beat frequencies of f(1) also changed. Similar behavior was seen
in the 1950s, and it is clear that VX Hydrae undergoes significant amplitude
changes over time.
