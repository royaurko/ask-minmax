We consider time-dependent Schroedinger equations in one dimension with
double well potential and an external nonlinear perturbation. If the initial
state belongs to the eigenspace spanned by the eigenvectors associated to the
two lowest eigenvalues then, in the semiclassical limit, we show that the
reduction of the time-dependent equation to a 2-mode equation gives the
dominant term of the solution with a precise estimate of the error. By means of
this stability result we are able to prove the destruction of the beating
motion for large enough nonlinearity.
