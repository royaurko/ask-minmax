Molecular phylogenetic techniques do not generally account for such common
evolutionary events as site insertions and deletions (known as indels). Instead
tree building algorithms and ancestral state inference procedures typically
rely on substitution-only models of sequence evolution. In practice these
methods are extended beyond this simplified setting with the use of heuristics
that produce global alignments of the input sequences--an important problem
which has no rigorous model-based solution. In this paper we consider a new
version of the multiple sequence alignment in the context of stochastic indel
models. More precisely, we introduce the following {\em trace reconstruction
problem on a tree} (TRPT): a binary sequence is broadcast through a tree
channel where we allow substitutions, deletions, and insertions; we seek to
reconstruct the original sequence from the sequences received at the leaves of
the tree. We give a recursive procedure for this problem with strong
reconstruction guarantees at low mutation rates, providing also an alignment of
the sequences at the leaves of the tree. The TRPT problem without indels has
been studied in previous work (Mossel 2004, Daskalakis et al. 2006) as a
bootstrapping step towards obtaining optimal phylogenetic reconstruction
methods. The present work sets up a framework for extending these works to
evolutionary models with indels.
