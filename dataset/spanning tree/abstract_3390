We revisit the problem of enumeration of vertex-tricolored planar random
triangulations solved in [Nucl. Phys. B 516 [FS] (1998) 543-587] in the light
of recent combinatorial developments relating classical planar graph counting
problems to the enumeration of decorated trees. We give a direct combinatorial
derivation of the associated counting function, involving tricolored trees.
This is generalized to arbitrary k-gonal tessellations with cyclic colorings
and checked by use of matrix models.
