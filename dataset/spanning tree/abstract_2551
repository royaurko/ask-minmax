The probability of simultaneous occurence of at least k spanning clusters has
been studied by Monte Carlo simulations on the 2D square lattice at the bond
percolation threshold Pc=1/2. The calculated probabilities for free boundary
conditions and periodic boundary conditions are in a very good coincidence with
the exact formulae developed recently by Cardy.
