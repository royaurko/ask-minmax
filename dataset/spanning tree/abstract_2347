We study various models of random non-crossing configurations consisting of
diagonals of convex polygons, and focus in particular on uniform dissections
and non-crossing trees. For both these models, we prove convergence in
distribution towards Aldous' Brownian triangulation of the disk. In the case of
dissections, we also refine the study of the maximal vertex degree and validate
a conjecture of Bernasconi, Panagiotou and Steger. Our main tool is the use of
an underlying Galton-Watson tree structure.
