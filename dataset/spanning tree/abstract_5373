Exposed positive maps in matrix algebras define a dense subset of extremal
maps. We provide a sufficient condition for a positive map to be exposed. This
is an analog of a spanning property which guaranties that a positive map is
optimal. We analyze a class of decomposable maps for which this condition is
also necessary.
