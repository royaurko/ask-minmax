Cut ideals, introduced by Sturmfels and Sullivant, are used in phylogenetics
and algebraic statistics. We study the minimal free resolutions of cut ideals
of tree graphs. By employing basic methods from topological combinatorics, we
obtain upper bounds for the Betti numbers of this type of ideals. These take
the form of simple formulas on the number of vertices, which arise from the
enumeration of induced subgraphs of certain incomparability graphs associated
to the edge sets of trees.
