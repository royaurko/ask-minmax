We explore quantitatively the conditions in which matter (protons, neutrons)
formed in the Early Universe during a period which spanned 10--50mus. We obtain
all chemical potentials implied by the present day baryon-to-photon ratio. The
baryochemical potential reaches its minimal value at the beginning of
hadronization of the quark Universe, where mu_b=1.1 \pm 0.25 eV. In the mixed
hadron-quark phase, a significant hadron sector electric charge distillation is
found.
