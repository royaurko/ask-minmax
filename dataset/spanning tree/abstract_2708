In every dimension $n\ge 3$ we introduce a class of orthogonal
graph-manifolds and prove that the fundamental group of any orthogonal
graph-manifold quasi-isometrically embeds into a product of $n$ trees. As a
consequence, we obtain that asymptotic and linearly-controlled asymptotic
dimensions of such group are equal to $n$.
