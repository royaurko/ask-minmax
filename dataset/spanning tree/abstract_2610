We consider the multi-collinear limit of multi-gluon QCD amplitudes at tree
level. We use the MHV rules for constructing colour ordered tree amplitudes and
the general collinear factorisation formula to derive timelike splitting
functions that are valid for specific numbers of negative helicity gluons and
an arbitrary number of positive helicity gluons (or vice versa).
