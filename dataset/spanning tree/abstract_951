We introduce a method for creating a special type of tree, called a tree
position, from a weighted graph. Leaves of the tree correspond to vertices of
the original graph, and the tree edges contain information which can be used to
partition these vertices. By repeatedly applying reducing operations to the
tree position we arrive at a special type of tree position we call thin, and we
show that partitions arising from thin tree positions have especially nice
properties. The algorithm is based the topological notion of thin position for
knots and 3-manifolds and builds on the previously defined idea of a
Topological Intrinsic Lexicographic Order (TILO).
