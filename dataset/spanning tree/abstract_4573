We study perturbative unitarity and electroweak oblique corrections in the
electroweak symmetry breaking models including an arbitrary number of neutral
Higgs bosons. Requiring the perturbative unitarity of the high energy
scattering amplitudes of weak gauge bosons and the neutral Higgs bosons at tree
level, we obtain a set of conditions among the Higgs coupling strengths
(unitarity sum rules). It is shown that the unitarity sum rules require the
tree level rho parameter to be 1 if there are only neutral Higgs bosons.
Moreover, we find that the one-loop finiteness of the electroweak oblique
corrections is automatically guaranteed once the unitarity sum rules are
imposed among the Higgs coupling strengths. Applying the unitarity sum rules,
we obtain severe constraints on the mass of the second lightest neutral Higgs
boson and the lightest neutral Higgs (a 125GeV Higgs) coupling strength from
the results of the electroweak precision tests as well as the unitarity.
