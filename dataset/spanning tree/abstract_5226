This paper present a geometric diagram of a separable state: If a mixed state
$\sigma $ is separable, there are $2^{nS(\sigma)}$ linearly independant product
vectors which span the same Hilbert space as the $2^{nS(\sigma)}$ ``likely''
strings of $\sigma ^{\otimes n}$ do. This diagram results in a criterion for
separability which is strictly stronger than the inorder criterion in [M.A.
Nielsen and J. Kempe, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5184 (2001)]. This means that the
number of product bases of states of a system has close link to the nonlocality
of the system.
