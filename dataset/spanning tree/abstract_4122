The process mu+ mu- --> H gamma, though small compared to the resonance
process, could be observable at proposed muon colliders, given expected
integrated luminosities. The apparently leading diagrams occur at tree-level,
and are proportional to the Higgs-muon coupling. We show, however, that the
one-loop contribution is comparable to the tree-level amplitude. Furthermore,
the one-loop diagrams, unlike those at tree-level, could be greatly enhanced by
possible anomalous Higgs-top quark or Higgs-gauge boson couplings. For a 500
GeV unpolarized muon collider, the total cross section for H-gamma associated
production approaches 0.1 fb.
