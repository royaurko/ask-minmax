We present results from observations of the magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 (SGR
J1550-5418) taken with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer (RXTE) following the source's outbursts in 2008 October and 2009
January. During the time span of the Chandra observations, which covers days 4
through 23 and days 2 through 16 after the 2008 and 2009 events, respectively,
the source spectral shape remained stable, while the pulsar's spin-down rate in
the same span in 2008 increased by a factor of 2.2 as measured by RXTE. The
lack of spectral variation suggests decoupling between magnetar spin-down and
radiative changes, hence between the spin-down-inferred magnetic field strength
and that inferred spectrally. We also found a strong anti-correlation between
the phase-averaged flux and the pulsed fraction in the 2008 and 2009 Chandra
data, but not in the pre-2008 measurements. We discuss these results in the
context of the magnetar model.
