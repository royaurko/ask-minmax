A prescription for constructing dictionaries for cardinal spline spaces on a
compact interval is provided. It is proved that such spaces can be spanned by
dictionaries which are built by translating a prototype B-spline function of
fixed support into the knots of the required cardinal spline space. This
implies that cardinal spline spaces on a compact interval can be spanned by
dictionaries of cardinal B-spline functions of broader support that the
corresponding basis function.
