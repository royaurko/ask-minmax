We study the behavior of an algorithm derived from the cavity method for the
Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) problem on graphs. The algorithm is based
on the zero temperature limit of the cavity equations and as such is formally
simple (a fixed point equation resolved by iteration) and distributed
(parallelizable). We provide a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art
algorithms on a wide range of existing benchmarks networks and random graphs.
Specifically, we consider an enhanced derivative of the Goemans-Williamson
heuristics and the DHEA solver, a Branch and Cut Linear/Integer Programming
based approach. The comparison shows that the cavity algorithm outperforms the
two algorithms in most large instances both in running time and quality of the
solution. Finally we prove a few optimality properties of the solutions
provided by our algorithm, including optimality under the two post-processing
procedures defined in the Goemans-Williamson derivative and global optimality
in some limit cases.
