We report measurements of the exclusive electroproduction of $K^+\Lambda$ and
$K^+\Sigma^0$ final states from a proton target using the CLAS detector at the
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The separated structure
functions $\sigma_T$, $\sigma_L$, $\sigma_{TT}$, and $\sigma_{LT}$ were
extracted from the $\Phi$- and $\epsilon$-dependent differential cross sections
taken with electron beam energies of 2.567, 4.056, and 4.247 GeV. This analysis
represents the first $\sigma_L/\sigma_T$ separation with the CLAS detector, and
the first measurement of the kaon electroproduction structure functions away
from parallel kinematics. The data span a broad range of momentum transfers
from $0.5\leq Q^2\leq 2.8$ GeV$^2$ and invariant energy from $1.6\leq W\leq
2.4$ GeV, while spanning nearly the full center-of-mass angular range of the
kaon. The separated structure functions reveal clear differences between the
production dynamics for the $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. These results
provide an unprecedented data sample with which to constrain current and future
models for the associated production of strangeness, which will allow for a
better understanding of the underlying resonant and non-resonant contributions
to hyperon production.
