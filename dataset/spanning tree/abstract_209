In a geometric network G = (S, E), the graph distance between two vertices u,
v in S is the length of the shortest path in G connecting u to v. The dilation
of G is the maximum factor by which the graph distance of a pair of vertices
differs from their Euclidean distance. We show that given a set S of n points
with integer coordinates in the plane and a rational dilation delta > 1, it is
NP-hard to determine whether a spanning tree of S with dilation at most delta
exists.
