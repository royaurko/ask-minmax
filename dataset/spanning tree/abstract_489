We investigate hierarchical structures of the European countries by using
debt as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the countries as they
change over a certain period of time. We obtain the topological properties
among the countries based on debt as a percentage of GDP of European countries
over the period 2000-2011 by using the concept of hierarchical structure
methods (minimal spanning tree, (MST) and hierarchical tree, (HT)). This period
is also divided into two sub-periods related to 2004 enlargement of the
European Union, namely 2000-2004 and 2005-2011, in order to test various
time-window and observe the temporal evolution. The bootstrap techniques is
applied to see a value of statistical reliability of the links of the MSTs and
HTs. The clustering linkage procedure is also used to observe the cluster
structure more clearly. From the structural topologies of these trees, we
identify different clusters of countries according to their level of debts and
economic ties. Our results show that by the debt crisis, the less and most
affected Eurozones economies are formed as a cluster with each other in the
MSTs and hierarchical trees.
