We present the results of an investigation into how the set of elementary trees
of a Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar can be represented in the lexical
knowledge representation language DATR (Evans & Gazdar 1989a,b). The LTAG under
consideration is based on the one described in Abeille et al. (1990). Our
approach is similar to that of Vijay-Shanker & Schabes (1992) in that we
formulate an inheritance hierarchy that efficiently encodes the elementary
trees. However, rather than creating a new representation formalism for this
task, we employ techniques of established utility in other lexically-oriented
frameworks. In particular, we show how DATR's default mechanism can be used to
eliminate the need for a non-immediate dominance relation in the descriptions
of the surface LTAG entries. This allows us to embed the tree structures in the
feature theory in a manner reminiscent of HPSG subcategorisation frames, and
hence express lexical rules as relations over feature structures.
