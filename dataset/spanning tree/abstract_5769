Two new formulas which express n-graviton MHV tree amplitudes in terms of
sums of squares of n-gluon amplitudes are discussed. The first formula is
derived from recursion relations. The second formula, simpler because it
involves fewer permutations, is obtained from the variant of the Berends,
Giele, Kuijf formula given in Arxiv:0707.1035.
