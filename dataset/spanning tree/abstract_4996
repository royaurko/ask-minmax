We present preliminary results of an incoming theoretical work concerning the
integrated properties of the Population III clusters of stars. On the basis of
synthetic Color-Magnitude Diagrams, we provide a grid of optical and near-IR
colors of Simple Stellar Populations with very low metallicity (Z=10$^{-10}$
and Z=10$^{-6}$) and age which spans from 10 Myr to 15 Gyr. A comparison with
higher metallicities up to 0.006 is also shown, disclosing sizable differences
in the CMD morphology, integrated colors and Spectral Energy Distribution
(SED).
