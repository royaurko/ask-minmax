We investigate the problem of sequentially predicting the binary labels on
the nodes of an arbitrary weighted graph. We show that, under a suitable
parametrization of the problem, the optimal number of prediction mistakes can
be characterized (up to logarithmic factors) by the cutsize of a random
spanning tree of the graph. The cutsize is induced by the unknown adversarial
labeling of the graph nodes. In deriving our characterization, we obtain a
simple randomized algorithm achieving in expectation the optimal mistake bound
on any polynomially connected weighted graph. Our algorithm draws a random
spanning tree of the original graph and then predicts the nodes of this tree in
constant expected amortized time and linear space. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that our method compares well to both global (Perceptron) and
local (label propagation) methods, while being generally faster in practice.
