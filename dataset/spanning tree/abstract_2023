This paper studies a Markov chain for phylogenetic reconstruction which uses
a popular transition between tree topologies known as subtree
pruning-and-regrafting (SPR). We analyze the Markov chain in the simpler
setting that the generating tree consists of very short edge lengths, short
enough so that each sample from the generating tree (or character in
phylogenetic terminology) is likely to have only one mutation, and that there
enough samples so that the data looks like the generating distribution. We
prove in this setting that the Markov chain is rapidly mixing, i.e., it quickly
converges to its stationary distribution, which is the posterior distribution
over tree topologies. Our proofs use that the leading term of the maximum
likelihood function of a tree T is the maximum parsimony score, which is the
size of the minimum cut in T needed to realize single edge cuts of the
generating tree. Our main contribution is a combinatorial proof that in our
simplified setting, SPR moves are guaranteed to converge quickly to the maximum
parsimony tree. Our results are in contrast to recent works showing examples
with heterogeneous data (namely, the data is generated from a mixture
distribution) where many natural Markov chains are exponentially slow to
converge to the stationary distribution.
