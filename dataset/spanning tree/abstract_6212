An effective theory for the soft field modes in hot QCD has been obtained
recently by integrating out the field modes of momenta of order T and g T. The
mean hard particle distribution obeys a transport equation with a collision
term. The scale that comes out for the soft field is g^2 T ln 1/g .
  N-gluon soft amplitudes are shown to be a sum of tree diagrams and to obey
tree-like Ward identities. These effective amplitudes are used to compute the
one-soft loop contribution to the gluon self-energy when the loop momentum is
of order g^2 T ln 1/g. It allows to identify a new collision term which, when
included into the transport equation, takes into account collisions with gluon
exchange of order g^2 T ln 1/g. The infrared behaviour of the collision term
exhibits a significant change.
