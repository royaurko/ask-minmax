We extend the Berkovits-Maldacena prescription for MHV amplitudes of the open
superstring to the closed superstring, showing that in the \alpha'=0 limit it
reduces to the result of supergravity found recently by Hodges. We also verify
that this prescription calculates the correct superstring tree level MHV
amplitude for 4 gravitons including \alpha' corrections.
