A new topological vertex finder is presented which combines ideas of the
well-established ZVTOP algorithm with a novel minimum spanning tree approach. A
preliminary performance study with simulated e+e- --> qqbar events at a centre
of mass energy of 92 GeV shows that the new approach is competitive with
existing vertex finder algorithms.
