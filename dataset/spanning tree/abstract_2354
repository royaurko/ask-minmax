We introduce the branching transitive closure operator on weighted monadic
second-order logic formulas where the branching corresponds in a natural way to
the branching inherent in trees. For arbitrary commutative semirings, we prove
that weighted monadic second order logics on trees is equivalent to the
definability by formulas which start with one of the following operators: (i) a
branching transitive closure or (ii) an existential second-order quantifier
followed by one universal first-order quantifier; in both cases the operator is
applied to step-formulas over (a) Boolean first-order logic enriched by modulo
counting or (b) Boolean monadic-second order logic.
