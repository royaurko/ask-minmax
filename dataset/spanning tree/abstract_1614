I will give a presentation of an abstract approach to finite Ramsey theory
found in an earlier paper of mine. I will prove from it a common generalization
of Deuber's Ramsey theorem for regular trees and a recent Ramsey theorem of
Jasinski for boron tree structures. This generalization appears to be new. I
will also show, in exercises, how to deduce from it the Milliken Ramsey theorem
for strong subtrees.
