In this paper we review some recent results that shed light on a fundamental
question in molecular systematics: how much phylogenetic `signal' can we expect
from characters that have evolved under some Markov process? There are many
sides to this question and we begin by describing some explicit bounds on the
probability of correctly reconstructing an ancestral state from the states
observed at the tips. We show how this bound sets upper limits on the
probability of tree reconstruction from aligned sequences, and we provide some
new extensions that allow site-to-site rate variation or a covarion mechanism.
We then explore the relationship between the number of sites required for
accurate tree reconstruction and other model parameters - such as the number of
species, and substitution probabilities, and we describe a phase transition
that occurs when substitution probabilities exceed a critical value. In the
remainder of this paper we turn to models of character evolution where the
state space is assumed to be either infinite or very large. These models have
some relevance to certain types of genomic data (such as gene order) and here
we again investigate how many characters are required for accurate tree
reconstruction.
