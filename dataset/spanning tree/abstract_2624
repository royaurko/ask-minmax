We give a combinatorial proof of the result of Hetyei and Reiner that there
are exactly $n!/3$ permutations of length $n$ in the minmax tree
representation of which the $i$th node is a leaf. We also prove the new result
that the number of $n$-permutations in which this node has one child is $n!/3$
as well, implying that the same holds for those in which this node has two
children.
