Erd\H{o}s conjectured that every triangle-free graph $G$ on $n$ vertices
contains a set of $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ vertices that spans at most $n^2 /50$
edges. Krivelevich proved the conjecture for graphs with minimum degree at
least $\frac{2}{5}n$. Keevash and Sudakov improved this result to graphs with
average degree at least $\frac{2}{5}n$. We strengthen these results by showing
that the conjecture holds for graphs with minimum degree at least
$\frac{5}{14}n$ and for graphs with average degree at least $(\frac{2}{5} -
\varepsilon)n$ for some absolute $\varepsilon >0$. Moreover, we show that the
conjecture is true for graphs which are close to the Petersen graph in edit
distance.
