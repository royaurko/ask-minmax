In this paper it is studied the propagator for the modified theory of gravity
proposed by Ho\vrava. We first calculate the propagator in the $\lambda=1$ case
and show that the main poles that arise correspond to the spin two particle and
scalar particle, already known in the literature. The presence of a bad
ultraviolet behaving term spoils renormalizability of the theory but it is
eliminated by imposing the detailed balance condition, although just a soft
version of this condition is actually needed. The problems of a negative mass
term and a residue with undefined sign, which is due to the presence of the
cosmological constant, is verified at the tree level demanding a complete
elimination of the tadpole in order to be fully analyzed. However, in the
absence of such constant, the extra scalar degree of freedom has no dynamics,
at least at the tree-level, and the theory posses only two dynamical degrees of
freedom. Also, to understand the implications of $\lambda$, we analyse a
simplified model, the $\lambda R$ theory, and verify that it becomes non
unitary, being a strong argument to set $\lambda=1$.
