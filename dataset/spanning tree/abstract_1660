In this paper, we consider constructibility of simplicial 3-balls. In many
cases, examining 1-dimensional subcomplexes of a simplicial 3-ball is efficient
to solve the decision problem whether the simplicial 3-ball is constructible or
not. From the point of view, we consider the case where a simplicial 3-ball has
spanning edges and present a sufficient condition for nonconstructibility.
