We present, for the Ising model on the Cayley tree, some explicit formulae of
the free energies (and entropies) according to boundary conditions (b.c.). They
include translation-invariant, periodic, Dobrushin-like b.c., as well as those
corresponding to (recently discovered) weakly periodic Gibbs states. The later
are defined through a partition of the tree that induces a 4-edge-coloring. We
compute the density of each color.
