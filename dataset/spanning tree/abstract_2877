In \cite{Kreimer1,Connes,Broadhurst,Kreimer2}, a commutative, non
cocommutative Hopf algebra H_R of (decorated) rooted trees was introduced. It
is related to the Hopf algebra H_CM introduced in \cite{Moscovici}. Its dual
Hopf algebra is the enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of rooted trees L^1.
  In this paper, we introduce a non commutative, non cocommutative Hopf algebra
H_PR of decorated planar rooted trees. We first show that H_PR is self dual. We
then use this result to construct a non degenerate bilinear form (,) on H_PR,
which respects the Hopf algebra structure of H_PR. Moreover, we give a
combinatorial expression for the bilinear form (,). This allows us to give a
direct formula for a basis of the primitive elements of H_PR.
  In the next sections, we show that H_PR is isomorphic to the Hopf algebra of
planar binary trees introduced in \cite{Frabetti, Brouder}, and construct a
subalgebra of formal non commutative diffeomorphisms. We then classify the Hopf
algebra endomorphisms and coalgebra endomorphisms of H_PR.
  In the last sections, we give results about tensorial coalgebras and apply
them to H_PR and H_R. We show how to construct the primitive elements of H_R
from the primitive elements of H_PR and finally prove that L^1 is a free Lie
algebra.
