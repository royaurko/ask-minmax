The Higgs boson decay, H -> mu mubar gamma, is studied in the Standard Model
at the tree and one-loop levels. It is shown that for Higgs boson masses above
110 GeV, the contribution to the radiative width from the one-loop level
exceeds the contribution from the tree level, and for Higgs boson masses above
140 GeV, it even exceeds the contribution from the tree level decay H -> mu
mubar. We also show that the contributions to the radiative decay width from
the interference terms between the tree and one-loop diagrams are negligible.
