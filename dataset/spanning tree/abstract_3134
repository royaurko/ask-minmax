In this paper we are concerned with contact processes with random edge
weights on rooted regular trees. We assign i.i.d weights on each edge on the
tree and assume that an infected vertex infects its healthy neighbor at rate
proportional to the weight on the edge connecting them. Under the annealed
measure, we define the critical value \lambda_c as the maximum of the infection
rate with which the process will die out and define \lambda_e as the maximum of
the infection rate with which the process dies out at exponential rate. We show
that these two critical values satisfy an identical limit theorem and give an
precise lower bound of \lambda_e. We also study the critical value under the
quenched measure. We show that this critical value equals that under the
annealed measure or infinity according to a dichotomy criterion. The contact
process on a Galton-Watson tree with binomial offspring distribution is a
special case of our model.
