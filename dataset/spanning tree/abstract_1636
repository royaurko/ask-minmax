An earlier characterization of topologically ordered (lexicographic)
path-length sequences of binary trees is reformulated in terms of an
integrality condition on a scaled Kraft sum of certain subsequences (full
segments, or islands). The scaled Kraft sum is seen to count the set of
ancestors at a certain level of a set of topologically consecutive leaves is a
binary tree.
