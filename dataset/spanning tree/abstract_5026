We present an infrared adaptation of the Cluster Red-Sequence method. We
modify the two filter technique of Gladders & Yee (2000) to identify clusters
based on their R-[3.6] color. We apply the technique to the 4 degree^2 Spitzer
First Look Survey and detect 123 clusters spanning the redshift range 0.09 < z
< 1.4. Our results demonstrate that the Spitzer Space Telescope will play an
important role in the discovery of large samples of high redshift galaxy
clusters.
