We prove a number of identities relating the sofic entropy of a certain class
of non-expansive algebraic dynamical systems, the sofic entropy of the Wired
Spanning Forest and the tree entropy of Cayley graphs of residually finite
groups. We also show that homoclinic points and periodic points in harmonic
models are dense under general conditions.
