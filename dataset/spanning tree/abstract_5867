We develop two methods to reconstruct a path of bounded variation from its
signature. The first method gives a simple and explicit expression of any axis
path in terms of its signature, but it does not apply directlty to more general
ones. The second method, based on an approximation scheme, recovers any
tree-reduced path from its signature as the limit of a uniformly convergent
sequence of lattice paths.
