The tree-depth is a parameter introduced under several names as a measure of
sparsity of a graph. We compute asymptotic values of the tree-depth of random
graphs. For dense graphs, p>> 1/n, the tree-depth of a random graph G is a.a.s.
td(G)=n-O(sqrt(n/p)). Random graphs with p=c/n, have a.a.s. linear tree-depth
when c>1, the tree-depth is Theta (log n) when c=1 and Theta (loglog n) for
c<1. The result for c>1 is derived from the computation of tree-width and
provides a more direct proof of a conjecture by Gao on the linearity of
tree-width recently proved by Lee, Lee and Oum. We also show that, for c=1,
every width parameter is a.a.s. constant, and that random regular graphs have
linear tree-depth.
