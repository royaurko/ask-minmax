Sumner's universal tournament conjecture states that any tournament on $2n-2$
vertices contains any directed tree on $n$ vertices. In this paper we prove
that this conjecture holds for all sufficiently large $n$. The proof makes
extensive use of results and ideas from a recent paper by the same contributors, in
which an approximate version of the conjecture was proved.
