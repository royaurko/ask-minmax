In this paper, we prove Chen & Huang's comparison principle in three
dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space, which originally proved in three
dimensional Euclidean space. Then we apply it to the constant mean curvature
equation in three dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space and prove that there is
only one critical point(i.e. minimal point) for the solutions of such equation
over convex domain, which is an analogue of Shigeru Sakaguchi's result in three
dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space. In [1], the contributors proved that there are
points with negative product of the principal curvatures for the spacelike
constant mean curvature surface spanning a planar convex curve. As an
application, our result shows that those points can not be the critical point.
