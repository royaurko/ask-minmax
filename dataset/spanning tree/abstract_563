We examine the effect of the R parity odd renormalizable interactions on
flavor non-diagonal rates and CP violation asymmetries in the production of
slepton pairs at $e^- - e^+$ leptonic colliders, for center of mass energies
spanning the interval from the Z-boson pole up to 1000 GeV. The lepton number
violating interactions, associated with the lepton number violating coupling
constants, are assumed to incorporate CP odd complex phases. The flavor
changing rates are controlled by tree level amplitudes and quadratic products
of different R parity violating coupling constants and the CP asymmetries by
interference terms between tree and loop level amplitudes and quartic products.
The consideration of loop amplitudes is restricted to the photon and Z-boson
vertex corrections. We present numerical results using a family and species
independent mass parameter, $\tilde m$, for all the scalar superpartners and
making simple assumptions for the family dependence of the R parity odd
coupling constants. The flavor non-diagonal rates, $\s_{JJ'}$, vary in the
range, $(\l/0.1)^4 2 - 20$ fbarns, as one spans the interval of center of mass
energies from the Z-boson pole up to 1000 GeV. For sleptons masses, $\tilde m>
150 $ GeV, these observables could be of use at NLC energies to set useful
bounds on the R parity odd coupling constants. The values of the asymmetries,
vary from a few to a few tens of $10^{-3}$.
