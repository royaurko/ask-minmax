In Aldous and Shields (1988), a model for a rooted, growing random binary
tree was presented. For some c>0, an external vertex splits at rate c^(-i) (and
becomes internal) if its distance from the root (depth) is i. For c>1, we
reanalyse the tree profile, i.e. the numbers of external vertices in depth
i=1,2,.... Our main result are concrete formulas for the expectation and
covariance-structure of the profile. In addition, we present the application of
the model to cellular ageing. Here, we assume that nodes in depth h+1 are
senescent, i.e. do not split. We obtain a limit result for the proportion of
non-senescent vertices for large h.
