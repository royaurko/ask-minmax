We establish an inequality which involves a non-negative function defined on
the vertices of a finite $m$-ary regular rooted tree. The inequality may be
thought of as relating an interaction energy defined on the free vertices of
the tree summed over automorphisms of the tree, to a product of sums of powers
of the function over vertices at certain levels of the tree. Conjugate powers
arise naturally in the inequality, indeed, H\"{o}lder's inequality is a key
tool in the proof which uses induction on subgroups of the automorphism group
of the tree.
