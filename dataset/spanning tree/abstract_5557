We have searched for periodicities in our VRIJHK photometry of PKS 2155-304,
which covers the years 2005-2012. A peak of the Fourier spectrum with high
significance is found at T$\sim$315 days, confirming the recent findings by
\cite{Zhang2014}. The examination of the gamma-ray light curves from
the\textit{ Fermi} archives yields a significant signal at $\sim$ 2T, which,
while nominally significant, involves data spanning only $\sim$ 6T. Assuming a
black hole mass of $10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$ the Keplerian distance corresponding to
the quasi-period T is $\sim10^{16}$ cm, about 50 Schwarzschild radii.
