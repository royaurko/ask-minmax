Let $G$ be a strongly connected directed graph. We consider the following
three problems, where we wish to compute the smallest strongly connected
spanning subgraph of $G$ that maintains respectively: the $2$-edge-connected
blocks of $G$ (\textsf{2EC-B}); the $2$-edge-connected components of $G$
(\textsf{2EC-C}); both the $2$-edge-connected blocks and the $2$-edge-connected
components of $G$ (\textsf{2EC-B-C}). All three problems are NP-hard, and thus
we are interested in efficient approximation algorithms. For \textsf{2EC-C} we
can obtain a $3/2$-approximation by combining previously known results. For
\textsf{2EC-B} and \textsf{2EC-B-C}, we present new $4$-approximation
algorithms that run in linear time. We also propose various heuristics to
improve the size of the computed subgraphs in practice, and conduct a thorough
experimental study to assess their merits in practical scenarios.
