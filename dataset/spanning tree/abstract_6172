This paper develops three polynomial-time pricing techniques for European
Asian options with provably small errors, where the stock prices follow
binomial trees or trees of higher-degree. The first technique is the first
known Monte Carlo algorithm with analytical error bounds suitable for pricing
single-stock options with meaningful confidence and speed. The second technique
is a general recursive bucketing-based scheme that can use the
Aingworth-Motwani-Oldham aggregation algorithm, Monte-Carlo simulation and
possibly others as the base-case subroutine. This scheme enables robust
trade-offs between accuracy and time over subtrees of different sizes. For
long-term options or high frequency price averaging, it can price single-stock
options with smaller errors in less time than the base-case algorithms
themselves. The third technique combines Fast Fourier Transform with
bucketing-based schemes for pricing basket options. This technique takes
polynomial time in the number of days and the number of stocks, and does not
add any errors to those already incurred in the companion bucketing scheme.
This technique assumes that the price of each underlying stock moves
independently.
