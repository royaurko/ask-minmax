In the paper we considere three state $p$-adic Potts model with competing
interactions on a Cayley tree of order two. We reduce a problem of describing
of the $p$-adic Gibbs measures to the solution of certain recursive equation,
and using it we will prove that a phase transition occurs if and only if $p=3$
for any value (non zero) of interactions. As well, we completely solve the
uniqueness problem for the considered model in a $p$-adic context. Namely, if
$p\neq 3$ then there is only a unique Gibbs measure the model.
