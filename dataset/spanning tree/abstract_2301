A data structure, called a biased range tree, is presented that preprocesses
a set S of n points in R^2 and a query distribution D for 2-sided orthogonal
range counting queries. The expected query time for this data structure, when
queries are drawn according to D, matches, to within a constant factor, that of
the optimal decision tree for S and D. The memory and preprocessing
requirements of the data structure are O(n log n).
