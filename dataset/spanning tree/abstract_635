The {\sc $k$-Leaf Out-Branching} problem is to find an out-branching (i.e. a
rooted oriented spanning tree) with at least $k$ leaves in a given digraph. The
problem has recently received much attention from the viewpoint of
parameterized algorithms {alonLNCS4596,AlonFGKS07fsttcs,BoDo2,KnLaRo}. In this
paper we step aside and take a kernelization based approach to the {\sc
$k$-Leaf-Out-Branching} problem. We give the first polynomial kernel for {\sc
Rooted $k$-Leaf-Out-Branching}, a variant of {\sc $k$-Leaf-Out-Branching} where
the root of the tree searched for is also a part of the input. Our kernel has
cubic size and is obtained using extremal combinatorics.
  For the {\sc $k$-Leaf-Out-Branching} problem we show that no polynomial
kernel is possible unless polynomial hierarchy collapses to third level
%$PH=\Sigma_p^3$ by applying a recent breakthrough result by Bodlaender et al.
{BDFH08} in a non-trivial fashion. However our positive results for {\sc Rooted
$k$-Leaf-Out-Branching} immediately imply that the seemingly intractable the
{\sc $k$-Leaf-Out-Branching} problem admits a data reduction to $n$ independent
$O(k^3)$ kernels. These two results, tractability and intractability side by
side, are the first separating {\it many-to-one kernelization} from {\it Turing
kernelization}. This answers affirmatively an open problem regarding "cheat
kernelization" raised in {IWPECOPEN08}.
