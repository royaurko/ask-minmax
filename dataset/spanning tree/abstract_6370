We consider absolutely free nonassociative algebras and, more generally,
absolutely free algebras with (maybe infinitely) many multilinear operations.
Such algebras are described in terms of labeled reduced planar rooted trees.
This allows to apply combinatorial techniques to study their Hilbert series and
the asymptotics of their coefficients. These algebras satisfy the
Nielsen-Schreier property and their subalgebras are also free. Then, over a
field of characteristic 0, we investigate the subalgebras of invariants under
the action of a linear group, their sets of free generators and their Hilbert
series. It has turned out that, except in the trivial cases, the algebra of
invariants is never finitely generated. In important partial cases the Hilbert
series of the algebras of invariants and the generating functions of their sets
of free generators are expressed in terms of elliptic integrals.
