We present results on the production of omega mesons at high transverse
momenta in pi^-Be interactions at 515 GeV/c. The data span the kinematic range
3.5 < p_T < 8 GeV/c. We compare the measured cross section with expectations
from Monte Carlo QCD generators. The relative yield of omega to pi^0 mesons is
used to extract the ratio of vector to pseudoscalar meson production for the
first generation of quarks.
