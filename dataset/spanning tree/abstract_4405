The orientable cover of the moduli space of real genus zero algebraic curves
with marked points is a compact aspherical manifold tiled by associahedra,
which resolves the singularities of the space of phylogenetic trees. The
resolution maps planar metric trees to their underlying abstract
representatives, collapsing and folding an explicit geometric decomposition of
the moduli space into cubes. This decomposition endows the resolving space with
an interesting canonical pseudometric.
  The second part of this paper defines a related (stacky) resolution of a
space of real quadratic forms, and suggests, perhaps without much
justification, that systems of oscillators parametrized by such objects may
provide useful models in genomics.
