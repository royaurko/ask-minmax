In order to explain the non-hierarchical neutrino mixing angles and the
absence of lepton flavor violating processes in the context of warped extra
dimensions one needs to introduce bulk flavor symmetries. We present a simple
model of lepton masses and mixings in RS models based on the A4 non-abelian
discrete symmetry. The virtues of this choice are: (i) the natural appearance
of the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern; (ii) the complete absence of tree-level
flavor violations in the neutral sector; (iii) the absence of flavor gauge
bosons; (iv) the hierarchies in the charged lepton masses are explained via
wave-function overlaps. We present the minimal field content and symmetry
breaking pattern necessary to obtain a successful model of this type. The
bounds from electroweak precision measurements allow the KK mass scale to be as
low as 3 TeV. Tree-level lepton flavor violation is absent in this model, while
the loop induced mu -> e gamma branching fraction is safely below the
experimental bound.
