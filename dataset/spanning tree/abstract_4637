We present a study of the resolved emission-line regions and an inner
dust/gas disk in the Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 3, based on Hubble Space Telescope
observations. We show that the extended narrow-line region (ENLR), spanning ~4
kpc, is defined by the intersection of the ionizing bicone of radiation from
the AGN and the inner disk, which is not coplanar with the large-scale stellar
disk. This intersection leads to different position and opening angles of the
ENLR compared to the narrow-line region (NLR). A number of emission-line arcs
in the ENLR appear to be continuations of dust lanes in the disk, supporting
this geometry. The NLR, which consists of outflowing emission-line knots
spanning the central ~650 pc, is in the shape of a backwards S. This shape may
arise from rotation of the gas, or it may trace the original fueling flow close
to the nucleus that was ionized after the AGN turned on.
