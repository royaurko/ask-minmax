We demonstrate a novel convenient nondestructive method based on optical
parametric amplification that allows retrieval of the zero-dispersion
wavelength map along a short optical fiber span with a high-spatial resolution.
The improved resolution relies on the high sensitivity to the local
longitudinal dispersion fluctuations of the parametric high-gain spectrum.
