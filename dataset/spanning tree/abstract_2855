CLPGUI is a graphical user interface for visualizing and interacting with
constraint logic programs over finite domains. In CLPGUI, the user can control
the execution of a CLP program through several views of constraints, of finite
domain variables and of the search tree. CLPGUI is intended to be used both for
teaching purposes, and for debugging and improving complex programs of
realworld scale. It is based on a client-server architecture for connecting the
CLP process to a Java-based GUI process. Communication by message passing
provides an open architecture which facilitates the reuse of graphical
components and the porting to different constraint programming systems.
Arbitrary constraints and goals can be posted incrementally from the GUI. We
propose several dynamic 2D and 3D visualizations of the search tree and of the
evolution of finite domain variables. We argue that the 3D representation of
search trees proposed in this paper provides the most appropriate visualization
of large search trees. We describe the current implementation of the
annotations and of the interactive execution model in GNU-Prolog, and report
some evaluation results.
