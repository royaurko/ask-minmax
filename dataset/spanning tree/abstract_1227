We survey the current state of progress on the Graceful Tree Conjecture, and
then we present several new results toward the conjecture, driven by three new
ideas: (1) It has been proven that generalized banana trees are graceful by
rearranging the branches at the root--consider rearranging branches at all
internal vertices; (2) The method of transfers has typically involved type-1
transfers and type-2 transfers--all type-2 transfers are type-1 transfers in
disguise, and hence can be removed from the discussion; (3) The method of
transfers has typically used the sequence of transfers $0\rightarrow
n\rightarrow 1\rightarrow n - 1\rightarrow\cdots$--transfer backwards to
manipulate the resulting labels. Using these ideas, we prove that several
classes of diameter-6 trees are graceful, and we generalize some of these
classes to larger trees. We also introduce a class of graceful spiders, prove
that attaching sufficiently many leaves to any tree gives a graceful tree, and
extend known results on trees with perfect matchings.
