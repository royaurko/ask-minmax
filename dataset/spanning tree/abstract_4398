In recent years, discovery of association rules among itemsets in a large
database has been described as an important database-mining problem. The
problem of discovering association rules has received considerable research
attention and several algorithms for mining frequent itemsets have been
developed. Many algorithms have been proposed to discover rules at single
concept level. However, mining association rules at multiple concept levels may
lead to the discovery of more specific and concrete knowledge from data. The
discovery of multiple level association rules is very much useful in many
applications. In most of the studies for multiple level association rule
mining, the database is scanned repeatedly which affects the efficiency of
mining process. In this research paper, a new method for discovering multilevel
association rules is proposed. It is based on FP-tree structure and uses
cooccurrence frequent item tree to find frequent items in multilevel concept
hierarchy.
