Xu introduced a system of partial differential equations to investigate
singular vectors in the Verma modules of highest weight $\lambda$ over
$\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$. He proved that the solution space of this system
in the space of truncated power series is spanned by $\{\sigma(1)\ |\ \sigma\in
S_n\}$. We present an explicit formula of the solution $s_\alpha(1)$ for every
positive root $\alpha$ and showed directly that $s_\alpha(1)$ is a polynomial
if and only if $\langle\lambda+\rho,\alpha\rangle$ is a nonnegative integer.
From this, we can recover a formula of singular vectors given by Malikov et al.
