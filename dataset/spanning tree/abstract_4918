On account of the progress of network multimedia technology, more and more
real-time multimedia applications arrive with the need to transmit information
using multicast communication. These applications are more important with the
arrival of mobile IPv6 protocol through mobile receivers and sources. These
applications require a multicast routing protocol which has packets arriving at
multicast receptors within a specified QoS guaranteed and a quick recovery
mechanism. When multicasting with mobile IPv6, the mobility of a receivers and
senders may lead to serious problems. When the receiver or sender moves, the
quality of full multicast tree may degrade so that multicast datagrams cannot
be forwarded efficiently. D2V-RPM (delay and delay variation RP Manager)
problem consist in choosing an optimal multicast router in the network as the
root of the shared multicast tree (ST) within a specified delay and delay
variation bound for all multicast session, and recovering this RP if it's not
optimal or it has failed. This NP hard problem needs to be solved through a
heuristic algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new RP Management algorithm
based on Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm, based on a systematic
neighborhood changing. D2VVNS-RPM algorithm selects and recovers the RP router
by considering tree cost, delay and delay variation. Simulation results show
that good performance is achieved.
