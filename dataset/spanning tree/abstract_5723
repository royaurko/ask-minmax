Topological string theory with twistor space as the target makes visible some
otherwise difficult to see properties of perturbative Yang-Mills theory. But
left-right symmetry, which is obvious in the standard formalism, is highly
unclear from this point of view. Here we prove that tree diagrams computed from
connected $D$-instanton configurations are parity-symmetric. The main point in
the proof also works for loop diagrams.
