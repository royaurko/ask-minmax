We uniquely characterize two members of the Q-Clustering family in an
axiomatic framework. We introduce properties that use known tree constructions
for the purpose of characterization. To characterize the Max-Sum clustering
algorithm, we use the Gomory-Hu construction, and to characterize
Single-Linkage, we use the Maximum Spanning Tree. Although at first glance it
seems these properties are `obviously' all that are necessary to characterize
Max-Sum and Single-Linkage, we show that this is not the case, by investigating
how subsets of properties interact. We conclude by proposing additions to the
taxonomy of clustering paradigms currently in use.
