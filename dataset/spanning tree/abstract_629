Previously, we proposed a physically inspired rule to organize the data
points in a sparse yet effective structure, called the in-tree (IT) graph,
which is able to capture a wide class of underlying cluster structures in the
datasets, especially for the density-based datasets. Although there are some
redundant edges or lines between clusters requiring to be removed by computer,
this IT graph has a big advantage compared with the k-nearest-neighborhood
(k-NN) or the minimal spanning tree (MST) graph, in that the redundant edges in
the IT graph are much more distinguishable and thus can be easily determined by
several methods previously proposed by us.
  In this paper, we propose a general framework to re-construct the IT graph,
based on an initial neighborhood graph, such as the k-NN or MST, etc, and the
corresponding graph distances. For this general framework, our previous way of
constructing the IT graph turns out to be a special case of it. This general
framework 1) can make the IT graph capture a wider class of underlying cluster
structures in the datasets, especially for the manifolds, and 2) should be more
effective to cluster the sparse or graph-based datasets.
