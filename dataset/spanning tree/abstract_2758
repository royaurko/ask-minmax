We construct total orders on the vertex set of an oriented tree. The orders
are based only on up-down counts at the interior vertices and the edges along
the unique geodesic from a given vertex to another.
  As an application, we provide a short proof (modulo Bass-Serre theory) of
Vinogradov's result that the free product of left-orderable groups is
left-orderable.
