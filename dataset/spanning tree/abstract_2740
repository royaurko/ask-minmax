The finite difference equation system introduced by Christiane Poupard in the
study of tangent trees is reinterpreted in the alternating permutation
environment. It makes it possible to make a joint study of both tangent and
secant trees and calculate the generating polynomial for alternating
permutations by a new statistic, referred to as being the greater neighbor of
the maximum.
