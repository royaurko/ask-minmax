We measure the fractal dimension of loop-erased random walk (LERW) in 3
dimensions, and estimate that it is 1.62400 +- 0.00005. LERW is closely related
to the uniform spanning tree and the abelian sandpile model. We simulated LERW
on both the cubic and face-centered cubic lattices; the corrections to scaling
are slightly smaller for the face-centered cubic lattice.
