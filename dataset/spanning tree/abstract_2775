We answer two questions of Shamik Ghosh in the negative. We show that there
exists a lobster tree of diameter less than 6 which accepts no alpha-labeling
with two central vertices labeled by the critical number and the maximum vertex
label. We also show a simple example of a tree of diameter 4, with an even
degree central vertex which does not accept a maximum label in any graceful
labeling.
