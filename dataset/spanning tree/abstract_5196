The role of QCD scales and chiral symmetry in finite nuclei is examined. The
Dirac-Hartree mean-field coupling constants of Nikolaus, Hoch, and Madland
(NHM) are scaled in accordance with the QCD-based prescription of Manohar and
Georgi. Whereas the nine empirically-based coupling constants of NHM span
thirteen orders of magnitude, the scaled coupling constants are almost all {\it
natural}, being dimensionless numbers of order one. We speculate that this
result provides good evidence that QCD and chiral symmetry apply to finite
nuclei.
