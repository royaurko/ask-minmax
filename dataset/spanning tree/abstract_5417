Recently, Alfakih and Ye [Lin. Algebra Appl. 438:31--36, 2013] proved that if
an $r$-dimensional bar framework $(G,p)$ on $n \geq r+2$ nodes in general
position in $\R^r$ admits a positive semidefinite stress matrix with rank
$n-r-1$, then $(G,p)$ is universally rigid. In this paper, we generalize this
result in two directions. First, we extend this result to tensegrity
frameworks. Second, we replace the general position assumption by the weaker
assumption that in configuration $p$, each point and its neighbors in $G$
affinely span $\R^r$.
