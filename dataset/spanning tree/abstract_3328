We examine basis functions on momentum space for the three dimensional
Euclidean Snyder algebra. We argue that the momentum space is isomorphic to the
SO(3) group manifold, and that the basis functions span either one of two
Hilbert spaces. This implies the existence of two distinct lattice structures
of space, on which continuous rotations and translations are unitarily
implementable.
