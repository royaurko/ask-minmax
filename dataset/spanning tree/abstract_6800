In this paper we investigate the problem of estimating the cluster tree for a
density $f$ supported on or near a smooth $d$-dimensional manifold $M$
isometrically embedded in $\mathbb{R}^D$. We analyze a modified version of a
$k$-nearest neighbor based algorithm recently proposed by Chaudhuri and
Dasgupta. The main results of this paper show that under mild assumptions on
$f$ and $M$, we obtain rates of convergence that depend on $d$ only but not on
the ambient dimension $D$. We also show that similar (albeit non-algorithmic)
results can be obtained for kernel density estimators. We sketch a construction
of a sample complexity lower bound instance for a natural class of manifold
oblivious clustering algorithms. We further briefly consider the known manifold
case and show that in this case a spatially adaptive algorithm achieves better
rates.
