We argue that generic one-loop scattering amplitudes in supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theories can be computed equivalently with MHV diagrams or with
Feynman diagrams. We first present a general proof of the covariance of
one-loop non-MHV amplitudes obtained from MHV diagrams. This proof relies only
on the local character in Minkowski space of MHV vertices and on an application
of the Feynman Tree Theorem. We then show that the discontinuities of one-loop
scattering amplitudes computed with MHV diagrams are precisely the same as
those computed with standard methods. Furthermore, we analyse collinear limits
and soft limits of generic non-MHV amplitudes in supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theories with one-loop MHV diagrams. In particular, we find a simple explicit
derivation of the universal one-loop splitting functions in supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theories to all orders in the dimensional regularisation parameter,
which is in complete agreement with known results. Finally, we present concrete
and illustrative applications of Feynman's Tree Theorem to one-loop MHV
diagrams as well as to one-loop Feynman diagrams.
