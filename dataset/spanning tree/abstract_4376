In ad hoc networks scalability is a critical requirement if these
technologies have to reach their full potential. Most of the proposed routing
protocols do not operate efficiently with networks of more than a few hundred
nodes. In this paper, we propose an augmented tree-based address space
structure and a hierarchical multi-path routing protocol, referred to as
Augmented Tree-based Routing (ATR), which utilizes such a structure in order to
solve the scalability problem and to gain good resilience against node
failure/mobility and link congestion/instability. Simulation results and
performance comparisons with existing protocols substantiate the effectiveness
of the ATR.
