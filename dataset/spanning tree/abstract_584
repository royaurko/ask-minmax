Operators are induced on fermion and zeon algebras by the action of adjacency
matrices and combinatorial Laplacians on the vector spaces spanned by the
graph's vertices. Properties of the algebras automatically give information
about the graph's spanning trees and vertex coverings by cycles \& matchings.
Combining the properties of operators induced on fermions and zeons gives a
fermion-zeon convolution that recovers the number of Hamiltonian cycles in an
arbitrary graph. The mathematics underlying the graph-theoretic interpretation
of these operators is provided by Kirchhoff's theorem and by the seminal works
of Goulden and Jackson and Liu, who established formulas for enumeration of
Hamiltonian cycles and paths using determinants and permanents of adjacency
matrices.
