We determine the effective cone of the Quot scheme parametrizing all rank r,
degree d quotient sheaves of the trivial bundle of rank n on P^1. More
specifically, we explicitly construct two effective divisors which span the
effective cone, and we also express their classes in the Picard group in terms
of a known basis.
