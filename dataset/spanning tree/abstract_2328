We consider the rooted trees which not have isomorphic representation and
introduce a conception of complexity a natural number also. The connection
between quantity such trees with $n$ edges and a complexity of natural number
$n$ is established. The recurrent ratio for complexity of a natural number is
founded. An expression for calculation of difference complexities of two
adjacent natural numbers is constructed. It is proved that this difference
equal 1 if and only if a natural number is simple. From proved theorems it
follows corollaries.
