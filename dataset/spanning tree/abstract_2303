Recurrence formulas are presented for studying the accuracy of the Fitch
method for reconstructing the ancestral states in a given phylogenetic tree. As
their applications, we analyze the convergence of the accuracy of
reconstructing the root state in a complete binary tree of $2^n$ as $n$ goes to
infinity and also give a lower bound on the accuracy of reconstructing the root
state in an ultrametric tree.
