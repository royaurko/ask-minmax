We consider a nearest-neighbor inhomogeneous $p$-adic Potts (with $q\geq 2$
spin values) model on the Cayley tree of order $k\geq 1$. The inhomogeneity
means that the interaction $J_{xy}$ couplings depend on nearest-neighbors
points $x, y $ of the Cayley tree. We study ($p-$ adic) Gibbs measures of the
model. We show that (i) if $q\notin p\mathbb{N}$ then there is unique Gibbs
measure for any $k\geq 1$ and $\forall J_{xy}$ with $|J_{xy}|<p^{-1/(p-1)}$.
(ii) For $q\in p\mathbb{N}, p\geq 3$ one can choose $J_{xy}$ and $k\geq 1$ such
that there exist at least two Gibbs measures which are translation-invariant.
