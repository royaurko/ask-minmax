In this letter we implement a recently proposed {\it spacetime duality}
approach to dualize a two dimensional, Abelian, gauge field theory, which has
no dual version under $p$--duality. Our result suggests that spacetime duality
spans a new, wider, class of dual theories, which cannot be related one to
another by $p$--duality transformations.
