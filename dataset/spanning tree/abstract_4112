The search for a standardized optimum way to communicate using natural
language dialog has involved a lot of research. However, due to the diversity
of communication domains, we think that this is extremely difficult to achieve
and different dialogue management techniques should be applied for different
situations. Our work presents the basis of a communication mechanism that
supports decision processes, is based on decision trees, and minimizes the
number of steps (turn-takes) in the dialogue. The initial dialog workflow is
automatically generated and the user's interaction with the system can also
change the decision tree and create new dialog paths with optimized cost. The
decision tree represents the chronological ordering of the actions (via the
parent-child relationship) and uses an object frame to represent the
information state (capturing the notion of context). This paper presents our
framework, the formalism for interaction and dialogue, and an evaluation of the
system compared to relevant dialog planning frameworks (i.e. finite state
diagrams, frame-based, information state and planning-based dialogue systems).
