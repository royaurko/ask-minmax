We propose a new inflation model in which a gauge singlet inflaton turns into
the Higgs condensate after inflation. The inflationary path is characterized by
a moduli space of supersymmetric vacua spanned by the inflaton and Higgs field.
The inflation energy scale is related to the soft supersymmetry breaking, and
the Hubble parameter during inflation is smaller than the gravitino mass. The
initial condition for the successful inflation is naturally realized by the
pre-inflation in which the Higgs plays a role of the waterfall field.
