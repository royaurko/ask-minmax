We exhibit a singly generated, semisimple commutative operator algebra with a
contractive approximate identity, such that the spectrum of the generator is a
null sequence and zero, but the algebra is not the closed linear span of the
idempotents associated with the null sequence and obtained from the analytic
functional calculus. Moreover the multiplication on the algebra is neither
compact nor weakly compact. Thus we construct a `large' operator algebra of
orthogonal idempotents, which may be viewed as a dense subalgebra of c0.
