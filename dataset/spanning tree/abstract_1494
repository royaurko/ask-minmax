This study is dedicated to precise distributional analyses of the height of
non-plane unlabelled binary trees ("Otter trees"), when trees of a given size
are taken with equal likelihood. The height of a rooted tree of size $n$ is
proved to admit a limiting theta distribution, both in a central and local
sense, as well as obey moderate as well as large deviations estimates. The
approximations obtained for height also yield the limiting distribution of the
diameter of unrooted trees. The proofs rely on a precise analysis, in the
complex plane and near singularities, of generating functions associated with
trees of bounded height.
