We present here a generalization of the work done by Rabin and Ben-Or. We
give a protocol for multiparty computation which tolerates any Q^2 active
adversary structure based on the existence of a broadcast channel, secure
communication between each pair of participants, and a monotone span program
with multiplication tolerating the structure. The secrecy achieved is
unconditional although we allow an exponentially small probability of error.
This is possible due to a protocol for computing the product of two values
already shared by means of a homomorphic commitment scheme which appeared
originally in a paper of Chaum, Evertse and van de Graaf.
