Consider the interchange process on a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ on $n$
vertices. I.e.\ shuffle a deck of cards by first placing one card at each
vertex of $G$ in a fixed order and then at each tick of the clock, picking an
edge uniformly at random and switching the two cards at the end vertices of the
edge with probability 1/2. Well known special cases are the random
transpositions shuffle, where $G$ is the complete graph, and the transposing
neighbors shuffle, where $G$ is the $n$-path. Other cases that have been
studied are the $d$-dimensional grid, the hypercube, lollipop graphs and Erd\H
os-R\'enyi random graphs above the threshold for connectedness.
  In this paper the problem is studied for general $G$. Special attention is
focused on trees, random trees and the giant component of critical and
supercritical $G(N,p)$ random graphs. Upper and lower bounds on the mixing time
are given. In many of the cases, we establish the exact order of the mixing
time. We also mention the cases when $G$ is the hypercube and when $G$ is a
bounded-degree expander, giving upper and lower bounds on the mixing time.
