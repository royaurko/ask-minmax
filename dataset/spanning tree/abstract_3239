By using the full span of multicolor data on a representative sample of first
overtone RR Lyrae stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) we revisit the
problem of the incidence rate of the amplitude/phase-modulated (Blazhko) stars.
Multicolor data, obtained by the MAssive Compact Halo Objects (MACHO) project,
are utilized through a periodogram averaging method. This enables us to
increase the number of detected multiperiodic variables by 18% relative to the
number obtained by the analysis of the best single color data. We also test the
maximum modulation period detectable in the present dataset. We find that
variables showing amplitude/phase modulations with periods close to the total
time span can still be clearly separated from the class of stars showing period
changes. This larger limit on the modulation period, the more efficient data
analysis and the longer time span lead to a substantial increase in the
incidence rate of the Blazhko stars in comparison with earlier results. We find
altogether 99 first overtone Blazhko stars in the full sample of 1332 stars,
implying an incidence rate of 7.5%. Although this rate is nearly twice of the
one derived earlier, it is still significantly lower than that of the
fundamental mode stars in the LMC. The by-products of the analysis (e.g.,
star-by-star comments, distribution functions of various quantities) are also
presented.
