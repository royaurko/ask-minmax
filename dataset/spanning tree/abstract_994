In this article it is shown that the Brownian motion on the continuum random
tree is the scaling limit of the simple random walks on any family of discrete
$n$-vertex ordered graph trees whose search-depth functions converge to the
Brownian excursion as $n\to\infty$. We prove both a quenched version (for
typical realisations of the trees) and an annealed version (averaged over all
realisations of the trees) of our main result. The assumptions of the article
cover the important example of simple random walks on the trees generated by
the Galton-Watson branching process, conditioned on the total population size.
