We introduce a deterministic model for scale-free networks, whose degree
distribution follows a power-law with the exponent $\gamma$. At each time step,
each vertex generates its offsprings, whose number is proportional to the
degree of that vertex with proportionality constant m-1 (m>1). We consider the
two cases: first, each offspring is connected to its parent vertex only,
forming a tree structure, and secondly, it is connected to both its parent and
grandparent vertices, forming a loop structure. We find that both models
exhibit power-law behaviors in their degree distributions with the exponent
$\gamma=1+\ln (2m-1)/\ln m$. Thus, by tuning m, the degree exponent can be
adjusted in the range, $2 <\gamma < 3$. We also solve analytically a mean
shortest-path distance d between two vertices for the tree structure, showing
the small-world behavior, that is, $d\sim \ln N/\ln {\bar k}$, where N is
system size, and $\bar k$ is the mean degree. Finally, we consider the case
that the number of offsprings is the same for all vertices, and find that the
degree distribution exhibits an exponential-decay behavior.
