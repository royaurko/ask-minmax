We give the asymptotic distribution of the length of partial coalescent trees
for Beta and related coalescents. This allows us to give the asymptotic
distribution of the number of (neutral) mutations in the partial tree. This is
a first step to study the asymptotic distribution of a natural estimator of DNA
mutation rate for species with large families.
