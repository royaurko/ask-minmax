We study internal diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) on the two dimensional
comb lattice. The comb lattice is a spanning tree of the euclidean lattice, and
internal DLA is a random growth model, where simple random walks, starting one
at a time at the origin of the comb, stop when reaching the first unoccupied
site. An asymptotic shape is suggested by a lower bound of Huss and Sava. We
show that fluctuations with respect to this shape are gaussian as in the
one-dimensional lattice.
