In this paper, we consider Ising-Vannimenus model on a Cayley tree for order
two with competing nearest-neighbor, prolonged next-nearest neighbor
interactions. We stress that the mentioned model was investigated only
numerically, without rigorous (mathematical) proofs. One of the main point of
this paper is to propose a measure-theoretical approach the considered model.
We find certain conditions for the existence of Gibbs measures corresponding to
the model. Then we establish the existence of the phase transition. Moreover,
the free energies of the found Gibbs measures are calculated.
