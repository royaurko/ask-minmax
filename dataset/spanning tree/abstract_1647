In this paper, inverse spectral problems for Sturm-Liouville operators on a
tree (a graph without cycles) are studied. We show that if the potential on an
edge is known a priori, then b - 1 spectral sets uniquely determine the
potential functions on a tree with b external edges. Constructive solutions,
based on the method of spectral mappings, are provided for the considered
inverse problems.
