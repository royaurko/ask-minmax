We confront the recently proposed exact S-matrices for AdS(3)/CFT(2) with
direct worldsheet calculations. Utilizing the BMN and Near Flat Space (NFS)
expansions for strings on AdS(3) x S(3) x S(3) x S(1) and AdS(3) x S(3) x T(4)
we compute both tree-level and one-loop scattering amplitudes. Up to some minor
issues we find nice agreement in the tree-level sector. At the one-loop level
however we find that certain non-zero tree-level processes, which are not
visible in the exact solution, contribute, via the optical theorem, and give an
apparent mismatch for certain amplitudes. Furthermore we find that a proposed
one-loop modification of the dressing phase correctly reproduces the worldsheet
calculation while the standard Hernandez-Lopez phase does not. We also compute
several massless to massless processes.
