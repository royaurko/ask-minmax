Trees of finite cone type have appeared in various contexts. In particular,
they come up as simplified models of regular tessellations of the hyperbolic
plane. The spectral theory of the associated Laplacians can thus be seen as
induced by geometry. Here we give an introduction focusing on background and
then turn to recent results for (random) perturbations of trees of finite cone
type and their spectral theory.
