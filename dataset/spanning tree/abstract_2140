Our current understanding of the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of
cellular organisms, especially the bacteria and archaea, is mostly based upon
studies of sequences of the small- subunit rRNAs (ssu-rRNAs). To address the
limitation of ssu-rRNA as a phylogenetic marker, such as copy number variation
among organisms and complications introduced by horizontal gene transfer,
convergent evolution, or evolution rate variations, we have identified protein-
coding gene families as alternative Phylogenetic and Phylogenetic Ecology
markers (PhyEco). Current nucleotide sequence similarity based Operational
Taxonomic Unit (OTU) classification methods are not readily applicable to amino
acid sequences of PhyEco markers. We report here the development of TreeOTU, a
phylogenetic tree structure based OTU classification method that takes into
account of differences in rates of evolution between taxa and between genes.
OTU sets built by TreeOTU are more faithful to phylogenetic tree structures
than sequence clustering (non phylogenetic) methods for ssu-rRNAs. OTUs built
from phylogenetic trees of protein coding PhyEco markers are comparable to our
current taxonomic classification at different levels. With the included OTU
comparing tools, the TreeOTU is robust in phylogenetic referencing with
different phylogenetic markers and trees.
