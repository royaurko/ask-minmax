We consider the decentralized binary hypothesis testing problem on trees of
bounded degree and increasing depth. For a regular tree of depth t and
branching factor k>=2, we assume that the leaves have access to independent and
identically distributed noisy observations of the 'state of the world' s.
Starting with the leaves, each node makes a decision in a finite alphabet M,
that it sends to its parent in the tree. Finally, the root decides between the
two possible states of the world based on the information it receives.
  We prove that the error probability vanishes only subexponentially in the
number of available observations, under quite general hypotheses. More
precisely the case of binary messages, decay is subexponential for any decision
rule. For general (finite) message alphabet M, decay is subexponential for
'node-oblivious' decision rules, that satisfy a mild irreducibility condition.
In the latter case, we propose a family of decision rules with close-to-optimal
asymptotic behavior.
