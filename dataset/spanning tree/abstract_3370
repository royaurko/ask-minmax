We describe the two-dimensional TreePM method in this paper. The 2d TreePM
code is an accurate and efficient technique to carry out large two-dimensional
N-body simulations in cosmology. This hybrid code combines the 2d Barnes and
Hut Tree method and the 2d Particle-Mesh method. We describe the splitting of
force between the PM and the Tree parts. We also estimate error in force for a
realistic configuration. Finally, we discuss some tests of the code.
