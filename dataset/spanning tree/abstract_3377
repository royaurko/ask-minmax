In this paper we show that an account for coordination can be constructed
using the derivation structures in a lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG).
We present a notion of derivation in LTAGs that preserves the notion of fixed
constituency in the LTAG lexicon while providing the flexibility needed for
coordination phenomena. We also discuss the construction of a practical parser
for LTAGs that can handle coordination including cases of non-constituent
coordination.
