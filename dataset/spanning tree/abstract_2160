We define analogues of the graphs of free splittings, of cyclic splittings,
and of maximally-cyclic splittings of $F_N$ for free products of groups, and
show their hyperbolicity. Given a countable group $G$ which splits as
$G=G_1\ast\dots\ast G_k\ast F$, where $F$ denotes a finitely generated free
group, we identify the Gromov boundary of the graph of relative cyclic
splittings with the space of equivalence classes of $\mathcal{Z}$-averse trees
in the boundary of the corresponding outer space. A tree is
\emph{$\mathcal{Z}$-averse} if it is not compatible with any tree $T'$, that is
itself compatible with a relative cyclic splitting. Two $\mathcal{Z}$-averse
trees are \emph{equivalent} if they are both compatible with a common tree in
the boundary of the corresponding outer space. We give a similar description of
the Gromov boundary of the graph of maximally-cyclic splittings.
