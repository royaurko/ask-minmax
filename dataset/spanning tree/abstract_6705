We study the explicit calculation of the set of superhedging portfolios of
contingent claims in a discrete-time market model for d assets with
proportional transaction costs. The set of superhedging portfolios can be
obtained by a recursive construction involving set operations, going backward
in the event tree. We reformulate the problem as a sequence of linear vector
optimization problems and solve it by adapting known algorithms. The
corresponding superhedging strategy can be obtained going forward in the tree.
Examples are given involving multiple correlated assets and basket options.
Furthermore, we relate existing algorithms for the calculation of the scalar
superhedging price to the set-valued algorithm by a recent duality theory for
vector optimization problems. The main contribution of the paper is to
establish the connection to linear vector optimization, which allows to solve
numerically multi-asset superhedging problems under transaction costs.
