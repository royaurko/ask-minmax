Hypersubstitutions are mappings which map operation symbols to terms. Terms
can be visualized by trees. Hypersubstitutions can be extended to mappings
defined on sets of trees. The nodes of the trees, describing terms, are
labelled by operation symbols and by colors, i.e. certain positive integers. We
are interested in mappings which map differently colored operation symbols to
different terms. In this paper we extend the theory of hypersubstitutions and
solid varieties to multi-hypersubstitutions and colored solid varieties. We
develop the interconnections between such colored terms and
multi-hypersubstitutions and the equational theory of Universal Algebra. The
collection of all varieties of a given type forms a complete lattice which is
very complex and difficult to study; multi-hypersubstitutions and colored solid
varieties offer a new method to study complete sublattices of this lattice.
