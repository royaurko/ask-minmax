We study the application of non-trivial relations between gravity tree
amplitudes, the bonus relations, to all tree-level amplitudes in N=8
supergravity. We show that the relations can be used to simplify explicit
formulae of supergravity tree amplitudes, by reducing the known form as a sum
of (n-2)! permutations obtained by solving on-shell recursion relations, to a
new form as a (n-3)!-permutation sum. We demonstrate the simplification by
explicit calculations of the next-to-maximally helicity violating (NMHV) and
next-to-next-to-maximally helicity violating (N^2MHV) amplitudes, and provide a
general pattern of bonus coefficients for all tree-level amplitudes.
