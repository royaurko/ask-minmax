We consider the monomer-dimer model on sequences of random graphs locally
convergent to trees. We prove that the monomer density converges almost surely,
in the thermodynamic limit, to an analytic function of the monomer activity. We
characterise this limit as the expectation of the solution of a fixed point
distributional equation and we give an explicit expression for the limiting
pressure per particle.
