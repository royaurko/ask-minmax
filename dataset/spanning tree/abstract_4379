We give an overview of two approaches to probability theory where lower and
upper probabilities, rather than probabilities, are used: Walley's behavioural
theory of imprecise probabilities, and Shafer and Vovk's game-theoretic account
of probability. We show that the two theories are more closely related than
would be suspected at first sight, and we establish a correspondence between
them that (i) has an interesting interpretation, and (ii) allows us to freely
import results from one theory into the other. Our approach leads to an account
of probability trees and random processes in the framework of Walley's theory.
We indicate how our results can be used to reduce the computational complexity
of dealing with imprecision in probability trees, and we prove an interesting
and quite general version of the weak law of large numbers.
