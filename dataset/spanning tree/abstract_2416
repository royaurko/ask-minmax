In this article, we propose Multiclass Bayesian Additive Classification Trees
(MBACT) as a nonparametric procedure to deal with multiclass classification
problems. MBACT is a multiclass extension of BART: Bayesian Additive Regression
Trees \citep{CGM10}. In a range of data generating schemes and real data
applications, MBACT is shown to have good predictive performance, competitive
to existing procedures, and in particular it outperforms most procedures when
the relationship between the response and predictors is nonlinear.
