Minimum market transparency requirements impose Hedge Fund (HF) managers to
use the statement declared strategy in practice. However each declared strategy
may actually origin a multiplicity of implemented management decisions. Is then
the "actual "strategy the same as the "announced" strategy? Can the actual
strategy be monitored or compared to the actual strategy of HF belonging to the
same "announced" class? Can the announced or actual strategy be used as a
quantitative argument in the fund of funds policy? With the appropriate metric,
it is possible to draw a minimum spanning tree (MST) to emphasize the
similarity structure that could be hidden in raw correlation matrix of HF
returns.
