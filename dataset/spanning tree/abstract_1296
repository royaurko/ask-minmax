Let $t$ be a rooted tree and $n_i(t)$ the number of nodes in $t$ having $i$
children. The degree sequence $(n_i(t),i\geq 0)$ of $t$ satisfies $\sum_{i\ge
0} n_i(t)=1+\sum_{i\ge 0} in_i(t)=|t|$, where $|t|$ denotes the number of nodes
in $t$. In this paper, we consider trees sampled uniformly among all trees
having the same degree sequence $\ds$; we write $`P_\ds$ for the corresponding
distribution. Let $\ds(\kappa)=(n_i(\kappa),i\geq 0)$ be a list of degree
sequences indexed by $\kappa$ corresponding to trees with size $\nk\to+\infty$.
We show that under some simple and natural hypotheses on
$(\ds(\kappa),\kappa>0)$ the trees sampled under $`P_{\ds(\kappa)}$ converge to
the Brownian continuum random tree after normalisation by $\nk^{1/2}$. Some
applications concerning Galton--Watson trees and coalescence processes are
provided.
