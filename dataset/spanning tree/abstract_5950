We prove logarithmic upper bounds for the diameters of the random-surfer
Webgraph model and the PageRank-based selection Webgraph model, confirming the
small world phenomenon holds for them. In the special case when the generated
graph is a tree, we provide close lower and upper bounds for the diameters of
both models.
