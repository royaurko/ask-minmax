Exploiting a bijective correspondence between planar quadrangulations and
well-labeled trees, we define an ensemble of infinite surfaces as a limit of
uniformly distributed ensembles of quadrangulations of fixed finite volume. The
limit random surface can be described in terms of a birth and death process and
a sequence of multitype Galton--Watson trees. As a consequence, we find that
the expected volume of the ball of radius $r$ around a marked point in the
limit random surface is $\Theta(r^4)$.
