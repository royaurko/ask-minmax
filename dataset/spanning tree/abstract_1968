The subcube partition model of computation is at least as powerful as
decision trees but no separation between these models was known. We show that
there exists a function whose deterministic subcube partition complexity is
asymptotically smaller than its randomized decision tree complexity, resolving
an open problem of Friedgut, Kahn, and Wigderson (2002). Our lower bound is
based on the information-theoretic techniques first introduced to lower bound
the randomized decision tree complexity of the recursive majority function.
  We also show that the public-coin partition bound, the best known lower bound
method for randomized decision tree complexity subsuming other general
techniques such as block sensitivity, approximate degree, randomized
certificate complexity, and the classical adversary bound, also lower bounds
randomized subcube partition complexity. This shows that all these lower bound
techniques cannot prove optimal lower bounds for randomized decision tree
complexity, which answers an open question of Jain and Klauck (2010) and Jain,
Lee, and Vishnoi (2014).
