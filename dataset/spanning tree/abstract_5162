For a finite undirected multigraph G=(V,E) and functions f,g:V-->\NN, let
N_f^g(G,j) denote the number of (f,g)-factors of G with exactly j edges. The
Heilmann-Lieb Theorem implies that \sum_j N_0^1(G,j) t^j is a polynomial with
only real (negative) zeros, and hence that the sequence {N_0^1(G,j)} is
strictly logarithmically concave. Separate generalizations of this theorem were
obtained by Ruelle and by the contributor. We unify, simplify, and generalize these
results by means of the Grace-Szeg\"o-Walsh Coincidence Theorem.
