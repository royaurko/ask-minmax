The BCFW recursion relation allows to calculate tree-level scattering
amplitudes in generalized Yang-Mills theory and, in particular, four-particle
amplitudes for the production rate of non-Abelian tensor gauge bosons of
arbitrary high spin in the fusion of two gluons. The consistency of the
calculations in different kinematical channels is fulfilled when all
dimensionless cubic coupling constants between vector bosons (gluons) and high
spin non-Abelian tensor gauge bosons are equal to the Yang-Mills coupling
constant. There are no high derivative cubic vertices in the generalized
Yang-Mills theory. The amplitudes vanish as complex deformation parameter tends
to infinity, so that there is no contribution from the contour at infinity. We
derive a generalization of the Parke-Taylor formula in the case of production
of two tensor gauge bosons of spin-s and N gluons (jets). The expression is
holomorhic in the spinor variables of the scattered particles, exactly as the
MHV gluon amplitude is, and reduces to the gluonic MHV amplitude when s=1. In
generalized Yang-Mills theory the tree level n-particle scattering amplitudes
with all positive helicities vanish, but tree amplitudes with one negative
helicity particle are already nonzero.
