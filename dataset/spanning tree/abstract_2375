The monochromatic tree partition number of an $r$-edge-colored graph $G$,
denoted by $t_r(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ such that whenever the edges of
$G$ are colored with $r$ colors, the vertices of $G$ can be covered by at most
$k$ vertex-disjoint monochromatic trees. In general, to determine this number
is very difficult. For 2-edge-colored complete multipartite graph, Kaneko,
Kano, and Suzuki gave the exact value of $t_2(K(n_1,n_2,...,n_k))$. In this
paper, we prove that if $n\geq 3$, and K(n,n) is 3-edge-colored such that every
vertex has color degree 3, then $t_3(K(n,n))=3.$
