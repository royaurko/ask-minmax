We present a toolbox for extracting asymptotic information on the
coefficients of combinatorial generating functions. This toolbox notably
includes a treatment of the effect of Hadamard products on singularities in the
context of the complex Tauberian technique known as singularity analysis. As a
consequence, it becomes possible to unify the analysis of a number of
divide-and-conquer algorithms, or equivalently random tree models, including
several classical methods for sorting, searching, and dynamically managing
equivalence relations
