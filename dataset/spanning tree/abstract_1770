We revisit the representation theory in type $A$used previously to establish
that the dissimilarity vectors of phylogenetic trees are points on the tropical
Grassmannian variety. We use a different version of this construction to show
that the space of phylogenetic trees $K_n$ maps to the tropical varieties of
every flag variety of $GL_n(\C).$ Using this map, we interpret the
tropicalization of the semistandard tableaux basis of an irreducible
representation of $GL_n(\C)$ as combinatorial invariants of phylogenetic trees.
