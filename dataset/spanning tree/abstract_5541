A model lattice ab initio parameterised Hamiltonian spanning a broad range of
alloy compositions and a large variety of chemical and magnetic configurations
has been developed for face-centered cubic Fe-Ni alloys. Thermodynamic and
magnetic properties of the alloys are explored using configuration and magnetic
Monte Carlo simulations in a temperature range extending well over 1000 K.
