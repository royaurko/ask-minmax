In this paper we provide the first examples of non-flat soap films proven to
span tetrahedra. These are members of a continuous two parameter family of soap
films with tetrahedral boundaries. Of particular interest is a two parameter
subfamily where each spanning soap film has the property that two minimal
surfaces meet along an edge of the boundary at an angle greater than 120
degrees.
