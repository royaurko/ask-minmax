Consider matrices of order $k+N$ over $p$-adic field determined up to
conjugations by elements of $GL$ over $p$-adic integers. We define a product of
such conjugacy classes and construct the analog of characteristic functions
(transfer functions), they are maps from Bruhat-Tits trees to Bruhat-Tits
buildings. We also examine categorical quotient for usual operator
colligations.
