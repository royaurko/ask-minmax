Search engines play a vital role in day to day life on internet. People use
search engines to find content on internet. Cloud computing is the computing
concept in which data is stored and accessed with the help of a third party
server called as cloud. Data is not stored locally on our machines and the
softwares and information are provided to user if user demands for it. Search
queries are the most important part in searching data on internet. A search
query consists of one or more than one keywords. A search query is searched
from the database for exact match, and the traditional searchable schemes do
not tolerate minor typos and format inconsistencies, which happen quite
frequently. This drawback makes the existing techniques unsuitable and they
offer very low efficiency. In this paper, we will for the first time formulate
the problem of effective fuzzy search by introducing tree search methodologies.
We will explore the benefits of B trees in search mechanism and use them to
have an efficient keyword search. We have taken into consideration the security
analysis strictly so as to get a secure and privacy-preserving system.
