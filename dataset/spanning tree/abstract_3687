We develop the Tree-Loop Duality Relation for two- and three-loop integrals
with multiple identical propagators (multiple poles). This is the extension of
the Duality Relation for single poles and multiloop integrals derived in
previous publications. We prove a generalization of the formula for single
poles to multiple poles and we develop a strategy for dealing with higher-order
pole integrals by reducing them to single pole integrals using Integration By
Parts.
