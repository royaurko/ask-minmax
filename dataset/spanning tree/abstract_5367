In this paper, we verify Carl de Boor's conjecture on ideal projectors for
real ideal projectors of type partial derivative by proving that there exists a
positive $\eta\in \mathbb{R}$ such that a real ideal projector of type partial
derivative $P$ is the pointwise limit of a sequence of Lagrange projectors
which are perturbed from $P$ up to $\eta$ in magnitude. Furthermore, we present
an algorithm for computing the value of such $\eta$ when the range of the
Lagrange projectors is spanned by the Gr\"{o}bner \'{e}scalier of their kernels
w.r.t. lexicographic order.
