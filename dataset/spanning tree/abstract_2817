We find sharp upper and lower bounds for the degree of an algebraic number in
terms of the $Q$-dimension of the space spanned by its conjugates. For all but
seven nonnegative integers $n$ the largest degree of an algebraic number whose
conjugates span a vector space of dimension $n$ is equal to $2^n n!$. The
proof, which covers also the seven exceptional cases, uses a result of Feit on
the maximal order of finite subgroups of $GL_n(Q)$; this result depends on the
classification of finite simple groups. In particular, we construct an
algebraic number of degree 1152 whose conjugates span a vector space of
dimension only 4.
  We extend our results in two directions. We consider the problem when $Q$ is
replaced by an arbitrary field, and prove some general results. In particular,
we again obtain sharp bounds when the ground field is a finite field, or a
cyclotomic extension of $Q$. Also, we look at a multiplicative version of the
problem by considering the analogous rank problem for the multiplicative group
generated by the conjugates of an algebraic number.
