In this paper we prove a functional limit theorem for the weighted profile of
a $b$-ary tree. For the proof we use classical martingales connected to
branching Markov processes and a generalized version of the profile-polynomial
martingale. By embedding, choosing weights and a branch factor in a right way,
we finally rediscover the profiles of some well-known discrete time trees.
