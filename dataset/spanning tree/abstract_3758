We study a percolation process on the planted binary tree, where clusters
freeze as soon as they become larger than some fixed parameter N. We show that
as N goes to infinity, the process converges in some sense to the frozen
percolation process introduced by Aldous. In particular, our results show that
the asymptotic behaviour differs substantially from that on the square lattice,
on which a similar process has been studied recently by van den Berg, de Lima
and Nolin.
