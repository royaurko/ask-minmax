We consider a relation between two kinds of unknotting numbers defined by
using a band surgery on unoriented knots; the band-unknotting number and
H(2)-unknotting number, which we may characterize in terms of the first Betti
number of surfaces in S^3 spanning the knot and the trivial knot. We also give
several examples for these numbers.
