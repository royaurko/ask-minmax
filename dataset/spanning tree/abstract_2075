The Pr\"ufer code is a bijection between trees on the vertex set $[n]$ and
strings on the set $[n]$ of length $n-2$ (Pr\"ufer strings of order $n$). In
this paper we examine the `locality' properties of the Pr\"ufer code, i.e. the
effect of changing an element of the Pr\"ufer string on the structure of the
corresponding tree. Our measure for the distance between two trees $T,T^*$ is
$\Delta(T,T^*)=n-1-| E(T)\cap E(T^*)|$. We randomly mutate the $\mu$th element
of the Pr\"ufer string of the tree $T$, changing it to the tree $T^*$, and we
asymptotically estimate the probability that this results in a change of $\ell$
edges, i.e. $P(\Delta=\ell | \mu).$ We find that P(\Delta=\ell | \mu)$ is on
the order of $ n^{-1/3+o(1)}$ for any integer $\ell>1,$ and that $P(\Delta=1 |
\mu)=(1-\mu/n)^2+o(1).$ This result implies that the probability of a `perfect'
mutation in the Pr\"ufer code (one for which $\Delta(T,T^*)=1$) is $1/3.$
