We study the asymptotic behavior of four statistics associated with subtrees
of complete graphs: the uniform probability $p_n$ that a random subtree is a
spanning tree of $K_n$, the weighted probability $q_n$ (where the probability a
subtree is chosen is proportional to the number of edges in the subtree) that a
random subtree spans and the two expectations associated with these two
probabilities. We find $p_n$ and $q_n$ both approach $e^{-e^{-1}}\approx .692$,
while both expectations approach the size of a spanning tree, i.e., a random
subtree of $K_n$ has approximately $n-1$ edges.
