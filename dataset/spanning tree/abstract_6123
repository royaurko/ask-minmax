We present Keck/NIRC2 and OSIRIS near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of
2M0441+2301 AabBab, a young (1--3 Myr) hierarchical quadruple system comprising
a low-mass star, two brown dwarfs, and a planetary-mass companion in Taurus.
All four components show spectroscopic signs of low surface gravity, and both
2M0441+2301 Aa and Ab possess Pa$\beta$ emission indicating they each harbor
accretion subdisks. Astrometry spanning 2008--2014 reveals orbital motion in
both the Aab (0.23" separation) and Bab (0.095" separation) pairs, although the
implied orbital periods of $>$300 years means dynamical masses will not be
possible in the near future. The faintest component (2M0441+2301 Bb) has an
angular $H$-band shape, strong molecular absorption (VO, CO, H$_2$O, and FeH),
and shallow alkali lines, confirming its young age, late spectral type (L1
$\pm$ 1), and low temperature ($\approx$1800~K). With individual masses of
200$^{+100}_{-50}$ Mjup, 35 $\pm$ 5 Mjup, 19 $\pm$ 3 Mjup, and 9.8 $\pm$ 1.8
Mjup, 2M0441+2301 AabBab is the lowest-mass quadruple system known. Its
hierarchical orbital architecture and mass ratios imply that it formed from the
collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud core, demonstrating that
planetary-mass companions can originate from a stellar-like pathway analogous
to higher-mass quadruple star systems. More generally, cloud fragmentation may
be an important formation pathway for the massive exoplanets that are now
regularly being imaged on wide orbits.
