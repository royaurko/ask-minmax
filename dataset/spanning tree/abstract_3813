The dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) is an enhancement of the
conventional discrete wavelet transform (DWT) due to a higher degree of
shift-invariance and a greater directional selectivity, finding its
applications in signal and image processing. This paper presents a quantitative
proof of the superiority of the DTCWT over the DWT in case of modulated
wavelets.
