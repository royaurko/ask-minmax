The Maximum Agreement Forest (Maf) problem is a well-studied problem in
evolutionary biology, which asks for a largest common subforest of a given
collection of phylogenetic trees with identical leaf label-set. However, the
previous work about the Maf problem are mainly on two binary phylogenetic trees
or two general (i.e., binary and non-binary) phylogenetic trees. In this paper,
we study the more general version of the problem: the Maf problem on multiple
general phylogenetic trees. We present a parameterized algorithm of running
time $O(3^k n^2m)$ and a 3-approximation algorithm for the Maf problem on
multiple rooted general phylogenetic trees, and a parameterized algorithm of
running time $O(4^k n^2m)$ and a 4-approximation algorithm for the Maf problem
on multiple unrooted general phylogenetic trees. We also implement the
parameterized algorithm and approximation algorithm for the Maf problem on
multiple rooted general phylogenetic trees, and test them on simulated data and
biological data.
