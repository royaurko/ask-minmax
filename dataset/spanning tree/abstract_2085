The problem of stabilizing an unstable plant over a noisy communication link
is an increasingly important one that arises in applications of networked
control systems. Although the work of Schulman and Sahai over the past two
decades, and their development of the notions of "tree codes"\phantom{} and
"anytime capacity", provides the theoretical framework for studying such
problems, there has been scant practical progress in this area because explicit
constructions of tree codes with efficient encoding and decoding did not exist.
To stabilize an unstable plant driven by bounded noise over a noisy channel one
needs real-time encoding and real-time decoding and a reliability which
increases exponentially with decoding delay, which is what tree codes
guarantee. We prove that linear tree codes occur with high probability and, for
erasure channels, give an explicit construction with an expected decoding
complexity that is constant per time instant. We give novel sufficient
conditions on the rate and reliability required of the tree codes to stabilize
vector plants and argue that they are asymptotically tight. This work takes an
important step towards controlling plants over noisy channels, and we
demonstrate the efficacy of the method through several examples.
