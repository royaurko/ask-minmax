We generalize the Gaussian moat problem to the finitely many imaginary
quadratic fields exhibiting unique factorization in their integers. We map this
problem to the Euclidean minimum spanning tree problem and use Delaunay
triangulation and Kruskal's algorithm to find moats in these fields in
$O(|\mathbf{P}| \log |\mathbf{P}|)$ time, where $\mathbf{P}$ denotes the set of
primes we are searching through. Our algorithm uses symmetry and boundaries to
correctly and efficiently identify all moats, in order of increasing length,
along with the farthest prime reached for each moat, in an underlying unbounded
graph of infinite primes. We also derive asymptotic estimates on the density of
primes in certain imaginary quadratic fields. Based on this and symmetry
arguments, we conjecture that for a given step bound $k$, we can travel farther
away from the origin in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and
$\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{-1+\sqrt{-3}}{2}\right]$ than in
$\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-2}]$. This conjecture is corroborated by our computational
results.
