Health informatics deal with the methods used to optimize the acquisition,
storage and retrieval of medical data, and classify information in healthcare
applications. Healthcare analysts are particularly interested in various
computer informatics areas such as; knowledge representation from data, anomaly
detection, outbreak detection methods and syndromic surveillance applications.
Although various parametric and non-parametric approaches are being proposed to
classify information from data, classification tree diagrams provide an
interactive visualization to analysts as compared to other methods. In this
work we discuss application of classification tree diagrams to classify
information from medical data in healthcare applications.
