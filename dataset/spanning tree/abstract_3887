Here we present a reconstruction of the Positive Operator-Value Measurement
of a photon-number-resolving detector comprised of three 50:50 beamsplitters in
a tree configuration, terminated with four single-photon avalanche detectors.
The four detectors' outputs are processed by an electronic board that
discriminates detected photon number states from 0 to 4 and implements a "smart
counting" routine to compensate for dead time issues at high count rates.
