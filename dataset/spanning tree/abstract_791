This paper describes Census, a protocol for node visitation in MANETs. Given
a set of tokens, the goal of Census is to ensure that every node is visited by
at least one token. Census is a gossip style protocol where the random walks of
the tokens are assisted by short, local gradients that guide the tokens towards
hitherto unvisited nodes. This achieves fast convergence while eschewing
routing structures such as spanning trees that incur a high messaging overhead
to maintain under mobility. Analytical bounds on convergence time and message
overhead are characterized for single token and multiple token scenarios. The
scalability and robustness of Census are demonstrated using simulations in
networks ranging from 150 to 4000 nodes.
