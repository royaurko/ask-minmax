It is conjectured that the Laplacian spectrum of a graph is majorized by its
conjugate degree sequence. In this paper, we prove that this majorization holds
for a class of graphs including trees. We also show that a generalization of
this conjecture to graphs with Dirichlet boundary conditions is equivalent to
the original conjecture.
