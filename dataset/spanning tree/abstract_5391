The entanglement of the two movable mirrors in a single mode cavity field is
studied in an ideal situation without thermal noise. When gn/w <<1 where g is
the coupling coefficient between the mirror and the field, w is the mirror'
vibration frequency and n is photon number of the cavity field, we work out
Wootters concurrence of the system initially with the field in Fock number
state and the two mirrors in vacuum states, and find that the states of the
mirrors are entangled into space spanned by |0>,|1> via radiation pressure,
though the concurrence is very small.
