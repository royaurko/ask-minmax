We present a strategy how to match the full set of components of the
heavy-light axial and vector currents in Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET),
up to and including 1/m-corrections, to QCD. While the ultimate goal is to
apply these matching conditions non-perturbatively, in this study we first have
implemented them at tree-level, in order to find good choices of the matching
observables with small O(1/m^2) contributions. They can later be employed in
the non-perturbative matching procedure which is a crucial part of precision
HQET computations of semileptonic decay form factors in lattice QCD.
