We study the collider phenomenology of the minimal unified version of the
supersymmetry breaking scheme called Tree-level Gauge Mediation. We identify a
peculiar source of gaugino mass non-universality related to the necessary
SU(5)-breaking in the light fermion mass ratios and a gaugino mass sum rule at
the GUT scale, 3 M_2 + 2 M_3 = 5 M_1, which represents a smoking gun of this
scenario, together with the known tree-level sfermion mass ratio \tilde
m_{d^c,l} = \sqrt{2} \tilde m_{q,u^c,e^c}. The boundary conditions of the soft
SUSY breaking terms can be parameterised in terms of six relevant parameters
only (plus the sign of the \mu-parameter). We analyze the parameter space and
define three benchmark points, corresponding to the three possible NLSPs, a
bino- or wino-like neutralino or the stau. The LSP is the gravitino as in gauge
mediation. For these benchmark points we show possible signatures at the LHC
focusing on the Razor variable. We also comment on the Higgs mass.
