We review the equivalence of two approaches to study theories with gauge
fields in extra spatial dimensions, namely the ``4D'' approach (with KK states)
and the ``5D'' approach (with matching to the 4D theory at the compactification
scale). In particular, we reiterate that there are two different power-law
scalings of ``effective'' gauge couplings. In a supersymmetric framework with
SUSY breaking in the radius modulus, i.e., the field which fixes the size of
the extra dimensions, these two approaches seem to give gaugino masses at
loop-level (with a possible enhancement due to large number of Kaluza-Klein
states) (hep-ph/0008069), and tree-level (hep-ph/0008103), respectively. We
show explicitly how this discrepancy can be resolved.
