We calculate multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) (spanning
optical to millimeter wavelengths) from simulations of major galaxy mergers
using a three-dimensional radiative transfer code, which treats the absorption
and scattering of radiation as well as the reemission from dust grains
self-consistently. These calculations allow us to deduce correlations from the
X-rays to millimeter wavelengths. We confirm observed correlations for Spitzer
Space Telescope's IRAC bands, as well as correlations observed in the IRAS era.
We also make predictions that should be testable by future instruments. The
power of the dynamical approach afforded by calculating fluxes from the merger
simulations is that we can directly correlate observed clustering in the data
as seen in IRAC color-color plots with the relative amount of time the system
spends in a region of color-color space. We also present photo albums spanning
the lifetime of SMGs, from its infancy in the pre-merger phase to its final
stage as an elliptical galaxy, as seen in various bands. Finally, we compare
the SEDs from the simulations to recent observations of SMGs. Our calculations,
which match observed correlations both for local ULIRGs and higher redshift
systems, suggest that simulations of major mergers with black hole feedback
provide an excellent framework within which to understand the emission from
local ULIRGs, and their high redshift cousins, the submillimeter galaxies.
