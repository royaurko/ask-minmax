We consider a model of algorithmic self-assembly of geometric shapes out of
square Wang tiles studied in SODA 2010, in which there are two types of tiles
(e.g., constructed out of DNA and RNA material) and one operation that destroys
all tiles of a particular type (e.g., an RNAse enzyme destroys all RNA tiles).
We show that a single use of this destruction operation enables much more
efficient construction of arbitrary shapes. In particular, an arbitrary shape
can be constructed using an asymptotically optimal number of distinct tile
types (related to the shape's Kolmogorov complexity), after scaling the shape
by only a logarithmic factor. By contrast, without the destruction operation,
the best such result has a scale factor at least linear in the size of the
shape, and is connected only by a spanning tree of the scaled tiles. We also
characterize a large collection of shapes that can be constructed efficiently
without any scaling.
