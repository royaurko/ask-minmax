In this note, we study the relation between the parity decision tree
complexity of a boolean function $f$, denoted by $\mathrm{D}_{\oplus}(f)$, and
the $k$-party number-in-hand multiparty communication complexity of the XOR
functions $F(x_1,\ldots, x_k)= f(x_1\oplus\cdots\oplus x_k)$, denoted by
$\mathrm{CC}^{(k)}(F)$. It is known that $\mathrm{CC}^{(k)}(F)\leq
k\cdot\mathrm{D}_{\oplus}(f)$ because the players can simulate the parity
decision tree that computes $f$. In this note, we show that
\[\mathrm{D}_{\oplus}(f)\leq O\big(\mathrm{CC}^{(4)}(F)^5\big).\] Our main tool
is a recent result from additive combinatorics due to Sanders. As
$\mathrm{CC}^{(k)}(F)$ is non-decreasing as $k$ grows, the parity decision tree
complexity of $f$ and the communication complexity of the corresponding
$k$-argument XOR functions are polynomially equivalent whenever $k\geq 4$.
  Remark: After the first version of this paper was finished, we discovered
that Hatami and Lovett had already discovered the same result a few years ago,
without writing it up.
