This paper is being withdrawn due to an error in the proof. Hao Chen has
shown the contributor in the two qubit case that there is an open set of three
dimensional subspaces that are spanned by separable states. This means the
contributor's proof is in error. The problem is that homogeneity cannot be used and
so the Jacobian needs to be computed at all points
