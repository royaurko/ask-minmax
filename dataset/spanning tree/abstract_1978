The supertree construction problem is about combining several phylogenetic
trees with possibly conflicting information into a single tree that has all the
leaves of the source trees as its leaves and the relationships between the
leaves are as consistent with the source trees as possible. This leads to an
optimization problem that is computationally challenging and typically
heuristic methods, such as matrix representation with parsimony (MRP), are
used. In this paper we consider the use of answer set programming to solve the
supertree construction problem in terms of two alternative encodings. The first
is based on an existing encoding of trees using substructures known as
quartets, while the other novel encoding captures the relationships present in
trees through direct projections. We use these encodings to compute a
genus-level supertree for the family of cats (Felidae). Furthermore, we compare
our results to recent supertrees obtained by the MRP method.
