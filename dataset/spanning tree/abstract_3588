In "Square partitions and Catalan numbers" (arXiv0912.4983), Bennett et al.
presented a recursive algorithm to create a family of partitions from one or
several partitions. They were mainly interested in the cases when we begin with
a single square partition or with several partitions with only one part. The
cardinalities of those families of partitions are the Catalan and ballot
numbers, respectively. In this paper we present a closed description for those
families. We also present bijections between those sets of partitions and sets
of trees and forests enumerated by the Catalan an ballot numbers.
