We calculate the contribution to Balmer line indices from far ultraviolet
component sources. We find that this is significant, and may lead to
identification of spurious age differences of the order of a total span of
$\sim 6$ Gyrs or $\sim 15%$ size bursts observed a few Gyrs after star
formation stops. We suggest that claims for intermediate age populations in
early-type galaxies may need to be reconsidered in the light of this new
evidence.
