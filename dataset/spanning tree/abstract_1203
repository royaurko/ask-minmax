In this note we discuss trees similar to the Calkin-Wilf tree, a binary tree
that enumerates all positive rational numbers in a simple way. The original
construction of Calkin and Wilf is reformulated in a more algebraic language,
and an elementary application of methods from analytic number theory gives
restrictions on possible analogues.
