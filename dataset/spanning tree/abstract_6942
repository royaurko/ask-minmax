Nakano's "later" modality, inspired by G\"{o}del-L\"{o}b provability logic,
has been applied in type systems and program logics to capture guarded
recursion. Birkedal et al modelled this modality via the internal logic of the
topos of trees. We show that the semantics of the propositional fragment of
this logic can be given by linear converse-well-founded intuitionistic Kripke
frames, so this logic is a marriage of the intuitionistic modal logic KM and
the intermediate logic LC. We therefore call this logic
$\mathrm{KM}_{\mathrm{lin}}$. We give a sound and cut-free complete sequent
calculus for $\mathrm{KM}_{\mathrm{lin}}$ via a strategy that decomposes
implication into its static and irreflexive components. Our calculus provides
deterministic and terminating backward proof-search, yields decidability of the
logic and the coNP-completeness of its validity problem. Our calculus and
decision procedure can be restricted to drop linearity and hence capture KM.
