Based on the differences between a spanning cluster and a wrapping cluster,
an alternative criterion for testing wrapping percolation is provided for
two-dimensional lattices. By following the Newman-Ziff method, the finite size
scaling of estimates for percolation thresholds are given. The results are
consistent with those from Machta's method.
