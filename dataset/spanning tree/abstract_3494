To a simplicial complex, we associate a square-free monomial ideal in the
polynomial ring generated by its vertex set over a field. We study algebraic
properties of this ideal via combinatorial properties of the simplicial
complex. By generalizing the notion of a tree from graphs to simplicial
complexes, we show that ideals associated to trees satisfy sliding depth
condition, and therefore have normal and Cohen-Macaulay Rees rings. We also
discuss connections with the theory of Stanley-Reisner rings.
