I present an overview of the study of infrared singularities through the
eikonal approximation and the concept of webs. Our work reveals the interesting
structure of an infinite subclass of webs, Multiple Gluon Exchange Webs. We
find that they can be expressed as sums of products of functions depending upon
only a single cusp angle, spanned by a simple basis of functions, and
conjecture that this structure will hold to all orders.
