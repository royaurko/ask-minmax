For graphs $G$ and $H$, an $H$-coloring of $G$ is an adjacency preserving map
from the vertices of $G$ to the vertices of $H$. $H$-colorings generalize such
notions as independent sets and proper colorings in graphs. There has been much
recent research on the extremal question of finding the graph(s) among a fixed
family that maximize or minimize the number of $H$-colorings. In this paper, we
prove several results in this area.
  First, we find a class of graphs ${\mathcal H}$ with the property that for
each $H \in {\mathcal H}$, the $n$-vertex tree that minimizes the number of
$H$-colorings is the path $P_n$. We then present a new proof of a theorem of
Sidorenko, valid for large $n$, that for every $H$ the star $K_{1,n-1}$ is the
$n$-vertex tree that maximizes the number of $H$-colorings. Our proof uses a
stability technique which we also use to show that for any non-regular $H$ (and
certain regular $H$) the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,n-2}$ maximizes the
number of $H$-colorings of $n$-vertex $2$-connected graphs. Finally, we show
that the cycle $C_n$ maximizes the number of proper colorings of $n$-vertex
$2$-connected graphs.
