A hyperbolic plane can be modeled by a structure called the enhanced binary
tree. We study the ferromagnetic Ising model on top of the enhanced binary tree
using the renormalization-group analysis in combination with transfer-matrix
calculations. We find a reasonable agreement with Monte Carlo calculations on
the transition point, and the resulting critical exponents suggest the
mean-field surface critical behavior.
