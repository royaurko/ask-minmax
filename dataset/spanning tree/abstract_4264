The simple Galton--Watson process describes populations where individuals
live one season and are then replaced by a random number of children. It can
also be viewed as a way of generating random trees, each vertex being an
individual of the family tree. This viewpoint has led to new insights and a
revival of classical theory. We show how a similar reinterpretation can shed
new light on the more interesting forms of branching processes that allow
repeated bearings and, thus, overlapping generations. In particular, we use the
stable pedigree law to give a transparent description of a size-biased version
of general branching processes in discrete time. This allows us to analyze the
$x\log x$ condition for exponential growth of supercritical general processes
as well as relation between simple Galton--Watson and more general branching
processes.
