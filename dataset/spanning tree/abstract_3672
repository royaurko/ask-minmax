We study under which condition an amalgamated free product or an
HNN-extension over a finite subgroup admits an amenable, transitive and
faithful action on an infinite countable set. We show that such an action
exists if the initial groups admit an amenable and almost free action with
infinite orbits (e.g. virtually free groups or infinite amenable groups). Our
result relies on the Baire category Theorem. We extend the result to groups
acting on trees.
