We use the transfer matrix formalism for dimers proposed by Lieb, and
generalize it to address the corresponding problem for arrow configurations (or
trees) associated to dimer configurations through Temperley's correspondence.
On a cylinder, the arrow configurations can be partitioned into sectors
according to the number of non-contractible loops they contain. We show how
Lieb's transfer matrix can be adapted in order to disentangle the various
sectors and to compute the corresponding partition functions. In order to
address the issue of Jordan cells, we introduce a new, extended transfer
matrix, which not only keeps track of the positions of the dimers, but also
propagates colors along the branches of the associated trees. We argue that
this new matrix contains Jordan cells.
