Using all the HST WFC/WFPC2 images of the field collected so far, we have
performed an accurate relative astrometry analysis to re-assess the value of
the Vela pulsar proper motion. Although covering a much shorter time span, our
measurement clearly confirms the previous result obtained by Nasuti et al.
(1997) using ground-based optical data and nails the proper motion value to mu
= 52 +/- 3 mas/yr.
