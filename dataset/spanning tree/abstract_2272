We discuss possible signatures of the tree level FCNC, which results from the
non-unitarity of CKM matrix. We first define the unitaity step-by-step, and
possible test of the non-unitaity through the 4-value-KM parametrization. We,
then, show how the phase angle of the unitary triangle would change in case of
the vector-like down quark model. As another example of tree FCNC, we
investigate the leptophobic $Z'$ model and its application to the recent $B_s$
mixing measurements.
