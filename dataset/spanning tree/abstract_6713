We present new and improved fixed-parameter algorithms for computing maximum
agreement forests (MAFs) of pairs of rooted binary phylogenetic trees. The size
of such a forest for two trees corresponds to their subtree prune-and-regraft
distance and, if the agreement forest is acyclic, to their hybridization
number. These distance measures are essential tools for understanding
reticulate evolution. Our algorithm for computing maximum acyclic agreement
forests is the first depth-bounded search algorithm for this problem. Our
algorithms substantially outperform the best previous algorithms for these
problems.
