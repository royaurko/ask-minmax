With the growing use of location-based services, location privacy attracts
increasing attention from users, industry, and the research community. While
considerable effort has been devoted to inventing techniques that prevent
service providers from knowing a user's exact location, relatively little
attention has been paid to enabling so-called peer-wise privacy--the protection
of a user's location from uncontributorized peer users. This paper identifies an
important efficiency problem in existing peer-privacy approaches that simply
apply a filtering step to identify users that are located in a query range, but
that do not want to disclose their location to the querying peer. To solve this
problem, we propose a novel, privacy-policy enabled index called the PEB-tree
that seamlessly integrates location proximity and policy compatibility. We
propose efficient algorithms that use the PEB-tree for processing privacy-aware
range and kNN queries. Extensive experiments suggest that the PEB-tree enables
efficient query processing.
