We investigate the structure of trees that have minimal algebraic
connectivity among all trees with a given degree sequence. We show that such
trees are caterpillars and that the vertex degrees are non-decreasing on every
path on non-pendant vertices starting at the characteristic set of the Fiedler
vector.
