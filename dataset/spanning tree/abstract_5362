Optical resonances spanning the Near and Short Infra-Red spectral regime were
exhibited experimentally by arrays of plasmonic nano-particles with concave
cross-section. The concavity of the particle was shown to be the key ingredient
for enabling the broad band tunability of the resonance frequency, even for
particles with dimensional aspect ratios of order unity. The atypical
flexibility of setting the resonance wavelength is shown to stem from a unique
interplay of local geometry with surface charge distributions.
