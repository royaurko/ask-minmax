This paper applies the Extreme-Value (EV) Generalised Pareto distribution to
the extreme tails of the return distributions for the S&P500, FT100, DAX, Hang
Seng, and Nikkei225 futures contracts. It then uses tail estimators from these
contracts to estimate spectral risk measures, which are coherent risk measures
that reflect a user's risk-aversion function. It compares these to VaR and
Expected Shortfall (ES) risk measures, and compares the precision of their
estimators. It also discusses the usefulness of these risk measures in the
context of clearinghouses setting initial margin requirements, and compares
these to the SPAN measures typically used. Keywords: Spectral risk measures,
Expected Shortfall, Value at Risk, Extreme Value
