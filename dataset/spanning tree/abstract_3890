The definition of graph automatic groups by Kharlampovich, Khoussainov and
Miasnikov and its extension to C-graph automatic by Murray Elder and the first
contributor raise the question of whether Thompson's group F is graph automatic. We
define a language of normal forms based on the combinatorial "caret types"
which arise when elements of F are considered as pairs of finite rooted binary
trees, which we show to be accepted by a finite state machine with 2 counters,
and forms the basis of a 3-counter graph automatic structure for the group.
