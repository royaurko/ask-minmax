We establish a generic formula for the generalised q-dimensions of measures
supported by almost self-affine sets, for all q>1. These q-dimensions may
exhibit phase transitions as q varies. We first consider general measures and
then specialise to Bernoulli and Gibbs measures. Our method involves estimating
expectations of moment expressions in terms of `multienergy' integrals which we
then bound using induction on families of trees.
