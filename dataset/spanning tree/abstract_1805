We characterize the extremal structures for mixing walks on trees that start
from the most advantageous vertex. Let $G=(V,E)$ be a tree with stationary
distribution $\pi$. For a vertex $v \in V$, let $H(v,\pi)$ denote the expected
length of an optimal stopping rule from $v$ to $\pi$. The \emph{best mixing
time} for $G$ is $\min_{v \in V} H(v,\pi)$. We show that among all trees with
$|V|=n$, the best mixing time is minimized uniquely by the star. For even $n$,
the best mixing time is maximized by the uniquely path. Surprising, for odd
$n$, the best mixing time is maximized uniquely by a path of length $n-1$ with
a single leaf adjacent to one central vertex.
