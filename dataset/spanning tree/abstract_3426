We calculate the generational mass splitting of neutrinos in high temperature
$SU(2)_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}\otimes U(1)$ gauge theory when the temperature
is above $250$ GeV and the gauge symmetry is restored. We consider the case of
neutrinos that are massless at tree level as well as the case of neutrinos with
tree-level mass and large mixing.
