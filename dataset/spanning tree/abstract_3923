We present a new formula for all tree amplitudes in four dimensional
supergravity coupled to super Yang-Mills. Like the Cachazo-He-Yuan formula, our
expression is supported on solutions of the scattering equations, but with
momenta written in terms of spinor helicity variables. Supersymmetry and parity
are both manifest. In the pure gravity and pure Yang-Mills sectors, it reduces
to the known twistor-string formulae. We show that the formula behaves
correctly under factorization. We sketch how these amplitudes may be obtained
from a four-dimensional (ambi)twistor string.
