We study the effectiveness of non-uniform randomized feature selection in
decision tree classification. We experimentally evaluate two feature selection
methodologies, based on information extracted from the provided dataset: $(i)$
\emph{leverage scores-based} and $(ii)$ \emph{norm-based} feature selection.
Experimental evaluation of the proposed feature selection techniques indicate
that such approaches might be more effective compared to naive uniform feature
selection and moreover having comparable performance to the random forest
algorithm [3]
