Separation Logic is a widely used formalism for describing dynamically
allocated linked data structures, such as lists, trees, etc. The decidability
status of various fragments of the logic constitutes a long standing open
problem. Current results report on techniques to decide satisfiability and
validity of entailments for Separation Logic(s) over lists (possibly with
data). In this paper we establish a more general decidability result. We prove
that any Separation Logic formula using rather general recursively defined
predicates is decidable for satisfiability, and moreover, entailments between
such formulae are decidable for validity. These predicates are general enough
to define (doubly-) linked lists, trees, and structures more general than
trees, such as trees whose leaves are chained in a list. The decidability
proofs are by reduction to decidability of Monadic Second Order Logic on graphs
with bounded tree width.
