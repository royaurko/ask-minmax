Garside groups are a natural lattice-theoretic generalization of the braid
groups and spherical type Artin-Tits groups. Here we show that the class of
Garside groups is closed under some free product with cyclic amalgamated
subgroups. We deduce that every tree product of infinite cyclic groups is a
Garside group. Moreover, we study those cyclic HNN extensions of Garside groups
that are Garside groups as well. Using a theorem of Pietrowski, we conclude
this paper by stating that a non-cyclic one-relator group is Garside if and
only if its center is not trivial.
