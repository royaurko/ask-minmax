The correlation coefficient between stocks depends on price history and
includes information on hierarchical structure in financial markets. It is
useful for portfolio selection and estimation of risk. I introduce the Life
Time of Correlation between stocks prices to know how far we should investigate
the price history to obtain the optimal durability of correlation. I carry out
my research on emerging (Poland) and established markets (in the USA, Great
Britain and Germany). Other methods, including the Minimum Spanning Trees, tree
half-life, decomposition of correlations and the Epps effect are also
discussed.
