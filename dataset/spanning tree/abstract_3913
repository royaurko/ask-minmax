We introduce a new class of noncommutative spectral triples on Kellendonk's
$C^*$-algebra associated with a nonperiodic substitution tiling. These spectral
triples are constructed from fractal trees on tilings, which define a geodesic
distance between tiles in the tiling. We show that each spectral triple is
$\theta$-summable and respects the hierarchy of the substitution system. To
elucidate our results we construct a fractal tree on the Penrose tiling and
explicitly show how it gives rise to a collection of spectral triples.
