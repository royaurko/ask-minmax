The notion of rectifying curve in the Euclidean space is introduced by Chen
as a curve whose position vector always lies in its rectifying plane spanned by
the tangent and the binormal vector field t and n_2 of the curve. In this
study, we have obtained some characterizations of semi-real spatial
quaternionic rectifying curves in R_1^3. Moreover, by the aid of these
characterizations, we have investigated semi real quaternionic rectifying
curves in semi-quaternionic space Q_v.
