We summarize the calculation of the weak corrections to dijet production at
hadron colliders, comprising tree-level effects of O(\alpha_s\alpha,\alpha^2)
and loop corrections of O(\alpha_s^2\alpha). Although suppressed by the small
value of the coupling constant \alpha, the weak radiative corrections can
become large in the high-energy domain due to the appearance of Sudakov-type
and other high-energy logarithms. Generally the corrections to the
transverse-momentum distributions are larger by approximately a factor of two
compared to the corresponding reach in the invariant-mass distributions,
because the invariant-mass distributions are not, unlike the k_T distributions,
dominated by the Sudakov regime at high scales. The electroweak tree-level
contributions are found to be of the same generic size as the loop corrections.
