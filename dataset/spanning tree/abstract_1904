The neighbor-joining algorithm is a popular phylogenetics method for
constructing trees from dissimilarity maps. The neighbor-net algorithm is an
extension of the neighbor-joining algorithm and is used for constructing split
networks. We begin by describing the output of neighbor-net in terms of the
tessellation of $\bar{\MM}_{0}^n(\mathbb{R})$ by associahedra. This highlights
the fact that neighbor-net outputs a tree in addition to a circular ordering
and we explain when the neighbor-net tree is the neighbor-joining tree. A key
observation is that the tree constructed in existing implementations of
neighbor-net is not a neighbor-joining tree. Next, we show that neighbor-net is
a greedy algorithm for finding circular split systems of minimal balanced
length. This leads to an interpretation of neighbor-net as a greedy algorithm
for the traveling salesman problem. The algorithm is optimal for Kalmanson
matrices, from which it follows that neighbor-net is consistent and has optimal
radius 1/2. We also provide a statistical interpretation for the balanced
length for a circular split system as the length based on weighted least
squares estimates of the splits. We conclude with applications of these results
and demonstrate the implications of our theorems for a recently published
comparison of Papuan and Austronesian languages.
