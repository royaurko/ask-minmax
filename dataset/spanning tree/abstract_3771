The number of "nonequivalent" Huffman codes of length r over an alphabet of
size t has been studied frequently. Equivalently, the number of "nonequivalent"
complete t-ary trees has been examined. We first survey the literature,
unifying several independent approaches to the problem. Then, improving on
earlier work we prove a very precise asymptotic result on the counting
function, consisting of two main terms and an error term.
