Finding interesting rule in the sixth strategy step about threshold control
on generalized relations in attribute oriented induction, there is possibility
to select candidate attribute for further generalization and merging of
identical tuples until the number of tuples is no greater than the threshold
value, as implemented in basic attribute oriented induction algorithm. At this
strategy step there is possibility the number of tuples in final generalization
result still greater than threshold value. In order to get the final
generalization result which only small number of tuples and can be easy to
transfer into simple logical formula, the seventh strategy step about rule
transformation is evolved where there will be simplification by unioning or
grouping the identical attribute. Our approach to measure interesting rule is
opposite with heuristic measurement approach by Fudger and Hamilton where the
more complex concept hierarchies, more interesting results are likely to be
found, but our approach the simpler concept hierarchies, more interesting
results are likely to be found and the more complex concept hierarchies, more
complex process generalization in concept tree. The decision to find
interesting rule is influenced with wide or length and depth or level of
concept tree.
