We consider the gravity-mediated SUSY breaking within the effective theory of
six-dimensional brane-world supergravity. We construct the supersymmetric
bulk-brane action by Noether method and find the nontrivial moduli coupling of
the brane F- and D-terms. We find that the low energy Kahler potential is not
of sequestered form, so gravity mediation may occur at tree level. In moduli
stabilization with anomaly effects included, the scalar soft mass squared can
be positive at tree level and it can be comparable to the anomaly mediation.
