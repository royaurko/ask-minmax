The main object of this course given in Hammamet (December 2014) is the
so-called Galton-Watson process.
  We introduce in the first chapter of this course the framework of discrete
random trees. We then use this framework to construct GW trees that describe
the genealogy of a GW process. It is very easy to recover the GW process from
the GW tree as it is just the number of individuals at each generation. We then
give alternative proofs of classical results on GW processes using the tree
formalism. We focus in particular on the extinction probability (which was the
first question of F. Galton) and on the description of the processes
conditioned on extinction or non extinction.
  In a second chapter, we focus on local limits of conditioned GW trees. In the
critical and sub-critical cases, the population becomes a.s. extinct and the
associated genealogical tree is finite. However, it has a small but positive
probability of being large (this notion must be precised). The question that
arises is to describe the law of the tree conditioned of being large, and to
say what exceptional event has occurred so that the tree is not typical. A
first answer to this question is due to H. Kesten who conditioned a GW tree to
reach height n and look at the limit in distribution when n tends to infinity.
There are however other ways of conditioning a tree to be large: conditioning
on having many vertices, or many leaves... We present here very recent general
results concerning this kind of problems due to the contributors of this course and
completed by results of X. He.
