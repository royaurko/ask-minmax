We present tight upper and lower bounds on the spanning ratio of a large
family of constrained $\theta$-graphs. We show that constrained $\theta$-graphs
with $4k + 2$ ($k \geq 1$ and integer) cones have a tight spanning ratio of $1
+ 2 \sin(\theta/2)$, where $\theta$ is $2 \pi / (4k + 2)$. We also present
improved upper bounds on the spanning ratio of the other families of
constrained $\theta$-graphs.
