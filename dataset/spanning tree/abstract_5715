A connection between the algebra of rooted trees used in renormalization
theory and Runge-Kutta methods is pointed out. Butcher's group and B-series are
shown to provide a suitable framework for renormalizing a toy model of field
the ory, following Kreimer's approach. Finally B-series are used to solve a
class of non-linear partial differential equations.
