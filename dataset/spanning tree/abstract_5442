Let $\Sigma_{\infty, 1}$ be the inductive limit of compact oriented surfaces
with one boundary component. We prove the center of the Goldman Lie algebra of
the surface $\Sigma_{\infty,1}$ is spanned by the constant loop. A similar
statement for a closed oriented surface was conjectured by Chas and Sullivan,
and proved by Etingof. Our result is deduced from a computation of the center
of the Lie algebra of oriented chord diagrams.
