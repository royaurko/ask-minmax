We study random two-component spanning forests ($2$SFs) of finite graphs,
giving formulas for the first and second moments of the sizes of the
components, vertex-inclusion probabilities for one or two vertices, and the
probability that an edge separates the components. We compute the limit of
these quantities when the graph tends to an infinite periodic graph in
${\mathbb R}^d$.
