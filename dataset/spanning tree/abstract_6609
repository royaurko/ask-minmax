The excessive [m]-index of a graph G is the minimum number of matchings of
size m needed to cover the edge-set of G. We call a graph G [m]-coverable if
its excessive [m]-index is finite. Obviously the excessive [1]-index is |E(G)|
for all graphs and it is an easy task the computation of the excessive
[2]-index for a [2]-coverable graph. The case m=3 is completely solved by
Cariolaro and Fu in 2009. In this paper we prove a general formula to compute
the excessive [4]-index of a tree and we conjecture a possible generalization
for any value of m. Furthermore, we prove that such a formula does not work for
the excessive [4]-index of an arbitrary graph.
