Statistical mechanics is applied to lossy compression using multilayer
perceptrons for unbiased Boolean messages. We utilize a tree-like committee
machine (committee tree) and tree-like parity machine (parity tree) whose
transfer functions are monotonic. For compression using committee tree, a lower
bound of achievable distortion becomes small as the number of hidden units K
increases. However, it cannot reach the Shannon bound even where K -> infty.
For a compression using a parity tree with K >= 2 hidden units, the rate
distortion function, which is known as the theoretical limit for compression,
is derived where the code length becomes infinity.
