A lower bound for the dimension of the $\Q$-vector space spanned by special
values of a Dirichlet series with periodic coefficients is given. As a
corollary, it is deduced that both special values at even integers and at odd
integers contain infinitely many irrational numbers. This result is proved by
T.Rivoal if the function considered is the Riemann zeta function, and this
paper gives its generalization to more general Dirichlet series.
