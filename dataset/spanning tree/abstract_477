We investigate the hierarchical structures of countries based on electricity
consumption and economic growth by using the real amounts of their consumption
over a certain time period. We use of electricity consumption data to detect
the topological properties of 60 countries from 1971 to 2008. These countries
are divided into three subgroups: low income group, middle income group and
high income group countries. Firstly, a relationship between electricity
consumption and economic growth is investigated by using the concept of
hierarchical structure methods (minimal spanning tree (MST) and hierarchical
tree (HT)). Secondly, we perform bootstrap techniques to investigate a value of
the statistical reliability to the links of the MST. Finally, we use a
clustering linkage procedure in order to observe the cluster structure more
clearly. The results of the structural topologies of these trees are as
follows: i) we identified different clusters of countries according to their
geographical location and economic growth, ii) we found a strong relation
between energy consumption and economic growth for all the income groups
considered in this study and iii) the results are in good agreement with the
causal relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth.
