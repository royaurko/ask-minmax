We present measurements from Brookhaven Experiment 864 of neutron invariant
multiplicity in 11.5 A GeV/c Au+Pb collisions. The measurements span a rapidity
range from center-of-mass to beam rapidity (y(beam)=3.2) and are presented as a
function of event centrality. The results are compared with E864 measurements
of proton invariant multiplicity and an average n/p ratio at hadronic
freeze-out of 1.19+-.08 is determined for the rapidity range y=1.6 to y=2.4. We
discuss briefly the implications of this ratio within a simple equilibrium
model of the collision system.
