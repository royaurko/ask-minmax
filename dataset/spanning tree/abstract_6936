Randomized controlled trials play an important role in how internet companies
predict the impact of policy decisions and product changes. Heterogeneity in
treatment effects refers to the fact that, in such digital experiments,
different units (people, devices, products) respond differently to the applied
treatment. This article presents a fast and scalable Bayesian nonparametric
analysis of heterogeneity and its measurement in relation to observable
covariates. New results are provided for quantifying uncertainty about four
different statistics that practitioners use to index heterogeneity: two based
on linear projections and two based upon regression tree partitioning. For the
linear projections, we mostly find that our Bayesian nonparametric inference
agrees with results from the frequentist literature. For the regression trees,
we are able to provide uncertainty quantification where this was previously
difficult without restrictive assumptions. We survey the application of these
statistics in three common tasks: recovery of the average treatment effect,
sparse summarization of the linear projections, and partitioning into groups of
relatively homogeneous response to treatment. Throughout, the work is
illustrated with an example experiment involving 21 million unique users of
