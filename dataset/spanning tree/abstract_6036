We formulate and give partial answers to several combinatorial problems on
volumes of simplices determined by $n$ points in 3-space, and in general in $d$
dimensions. (i) The number of tetrahedra of minimum (nonzero) volume spanned by
$n$ points in $\RR^3$ is at most ${2/3}n^3-O(n^2)$, and there are point sets
for which this number is ${3/16}n^3-O(n^2)$. We also present an $O(n^3)$ time
algorithm for reporting all tetrahedra of minimum nonzero volume, and thereby
extend an algorithm of Edelsbrunner, O'Rourke, and Seidel. In general, for
every $k,d\in \NN$, $1\leq k \leq d$, the maximum number of $k$-dimensional
simplices of minimum (nonzero) volume spanned by $n$ points in $\RR^d$ is
$\Theta(n^k)$. (ii) The number of unit-volume tetrahedra determined by $n$
points in $\RR^3$ is $O(n^{7/2})$, and there are point sets for which this
number is $\Omega(n^3 \log \log{n})$. (iii) For every $d\in \NN$, the minimum
number of distinct volumes of all full-dimensional simplices determined by $n$
points in $\RR^d$, not all on a hyperplane, is $\Theta(n)$.
