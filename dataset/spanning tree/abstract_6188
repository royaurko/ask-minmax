Some of the soft SUSY breaking parameters in hidden sector supergravity model
depend on the expectation value of the hidden sector scalar potential, $<V_h>$,
whose tree level value is equal to the tree level cosmological constant. The
current practice of calculating soft parameters assumes that $<V_h>=0$. Quantum
correction to the cosmological constant can differ from the correction to
$<V_h>$ by an amount of order $m^2_{3/2}M_{Pl}^2/8\pi$. This implies that, for
the vanishing cosmological constant, the $<V_h>$--dependent parts of soft terms
can be sizable, and hence the supergravity phenomenology should be accordingly
modified.
