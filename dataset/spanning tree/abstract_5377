In [LV] the contributors defined a Hecke algebra action and a bar involution on a
vector space spanned by the involutions in a Weyl group. In this paper we give
a new definition of the Hecke algebra action and the bar operator which, unlike
the one in [LV], is completely elementary (does not use geometry) and in
particular it makes sense for an arbitrary Coxeter group.
