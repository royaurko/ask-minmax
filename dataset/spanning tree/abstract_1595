We propose an algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of
partially observable games using Monte-Carlo tree search based on recent bandit
methods. We obtain experimental results for the game of phantom tic-tac-toe,
showing that strong strategies can be efficiently computed by our algorithm.
