The TREE method has been widely used for long-range interaction {\it N}-body
problems. We have developed a parallel TREE code for two-component classical
plasmas with open boundary conditions and highly non-uniform charge
distributions. The program efficiently handles millions of particles evolved
over long relaxation times requiring millions of time steps. Appropriate domain
decomposition and dynamic data management were employed, and large-scale
parallel processing was achieved using an intermediate level of granularity of
domain decomposition and ghost TREE communication. Even though the
computational load is not fully distributed in fine grains, high parallel
efficiency was achieved for ultracold plasma systems of charged particles. As
an application, we performed simulations of an ultracold neutral plasma with a
half million particles and a half million time steps. For the long temporal
trajectories of relaxation between heavy ions and light electrons, large
configurations of ultracold plasmas can now be investigated, which was not
possible in past studies.
