We derive relations between geometric means of the Fourier moduli of a
refinable distribution and of a related polynomial. We use Pisot-Vijayaraghavan
numbers to construct families of one dimension quasilattices and
multiresolution analyses spanned by distributions that are refinable with
respect to dilation by the PV numbers and translation by quasilattice points.
We conjecture that scalar valued refinable distributions are never integrable,
construct piecewise constant vector valued refinable functions, and discuss
multidimensional extensions.
