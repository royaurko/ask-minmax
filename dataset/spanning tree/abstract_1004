Let $\mathcal{T}_n$ be the set of trees with $n$ vertices. Suppose that each
tree in $\mathcal{T}_n$ is equally likely. We show that the number of different
rooted trees of a tree equals $(\mu_r+o(1))n$ for almost every tree of
$\mathcal{T}_n$, where $\mu_r$ is a constant. As an application, we show that
the number of any given pattern in $\mathcal{T}_n$ is also asymptotically
normally distributed with mean $\sim \mu_M n$ and variance $\sim \sigma_M n$,
where $\mu_M, \sigma_M$ are some constants related to the given pattern. This
solves an open question claimed in Kok's thesis.
