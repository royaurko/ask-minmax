Single Cut-or-Join is, computationally, the simplest mathematical model of
genome rearrangement. Given a collection of species, we fix a tree which
represents their ancestral histories, labeling the leaves with the observed
genomes. To assess the likelihood of an assignment of ancestors, we use the
parsimony criterion. For each most parsimonious labeling of the ancestors, we
relate each pair of vertices along a common edge with an Single Cut-or-Join
scenario to create a most parsimonious SCJ scenario.
  Here, we determine that the problem of counting the number of most
parsimonious SCJ scenarios is \#P-complete when the ancestral tree is a star or
a binary tree. Further, we extend the result for star trees to analogous
questions, weighting each most parsimonious labeling in various ways in the
summation over all most parsimonious labelings.
