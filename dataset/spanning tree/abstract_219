We study the expected value of the length $L_n$ of the minimum spanning tree
of the complete graph $K_n$ when each edge $e$ is given an independent uniform
$[0,1]$ edge weight. We sharpen the result of Frieze \cite{F1} that
$\lim_{n\to\infty}\E(L_n)=\z(3)$ and show that
$\E(L_n)=\z(3)+\frac{c_1}{n}+\frac{c_2+o(1)}{n^{4/3}}$ where $c_1,c_2$ are
explicitly defined constants.
