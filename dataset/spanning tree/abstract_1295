In this article we propose a new method, which we name 'quartet neighbor
joining', or 'quartet-NJ', to infer an unrooted species tree on a given set of
taxa T from empirical distributions of unrooted quartet gene trees on all
four-taxon subsets of T. In particular, quartet-NJ can be used to estimate a
species tree on T from distributions of gene trees on T. The quartet-NJ
algorithm is conceptually very similar to classical neighbor joining, and its
statistical consistency under the multispecies coalescent model is proved by a
variant of the classical 'cherry picking'-theorem. In order to demonstrate the
suitability of quartet-NJ, coalescent processes on two different species trees
(on five resp. nine taxa) were simulated, and quartet-NJ was applied to the
simulated gene tree distributions. Further, quartet-NJ was applied to quartet
distributions obtained from multiple sequence alignments of 28 proteins of nine
prokaryotes.
