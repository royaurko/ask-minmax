LOFAR, the Low Frequency Array, is an innovative new radio telescope
currently under construction in the Netherlands. With its continuous monitoring
of the radio sky we expect LOFAR will detect many new transient events,
including GRB afterglows and pulsating/single-burst neutron stars. We here
describe all-sky surveys ranging from a time resolution of microseconds to a
cadence span of years.
