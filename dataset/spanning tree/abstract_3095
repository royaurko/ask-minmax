Automata for unordered unranked trees are relevant for defining schemas and
queries for data trees in Json or Xml format. While the existing notions are
well-investigated concerning expressiveness, they all lack a proper notion of
determinism, which makes it difficult to distinguish subclasses of automata for
which problems such as inclusion, equivalence, and minimization can be solved
efficiently. In this paper, we propose and investigate different notions of
"horizontal determinism", starting from automata for unranked trees in which
the horizontal evaluation is performed by finite state automata. We show that a
restriction to confluent horizontal evaluation leads to polynomial-time
emptiness and universality, but still suffers from coNP-completeness of the
emptiness of binary intersections. Finally, efficient algorithms can be
obtained by imposing an order of horizontal evaluation globally for all
automata in the class. Depending on the choice of the order, we obtain
different classes of automata, each of which has the same expressiveness as
CMso.
