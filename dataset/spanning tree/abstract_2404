In this article, we use Ward identity to calculate tree and one loop level
off shell amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills theory with a pair of external lines
complexified. We explicitly prove Ward identity at tree and one loop level
using Feynman rules, and then give recursion relations for the off shell
amplitudes. We find that the cancellation details in the proof of Ward identity
simplifies our derivation of the recursion relations. Then we calculate three
and four point one loop off shell amplitudes as examples of our method.
