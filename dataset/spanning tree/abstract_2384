We study a natural Lie algebra structure on the free vector space generated
by all rooted planar trees as the associated Lie algebra of the nonsymmetric
operad (non-$\Sigma$ operad, preoperad) of rooted planar trees. We determine
whether the Lie algebra and some related Lie algebras are finitely generated or
not, and prove that a natural surjection called the augmentation homomorphism
onto the Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields on the line has no splitting
preserving the units.
