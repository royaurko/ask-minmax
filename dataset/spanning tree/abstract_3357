We prove some inequalities involving fourth central moment of a random
variable that takes values in a given finite interval. Both discrete and
continuous cases are considered. Bounds for the spread are obtained when a
given nxn complex matrix has real eigenvalues. Likewise, we discuss bounds for
the spans of polynomial equations.
