We present proper motions for 21 bright main shell and 17 faint,
higher-velocity, outer ejecta knots in the Cas A supernova remnant and use them
to derive new estimates for the remnant's expansion center and age. Our study
included 1951 - 1976 Palomar 5 m prime focus plates, 1988 - 1999 CCD images
from the KPNO 4 m and MDM 2.4 m telescopes, and 1999 HST WFPC2 images.
Measurable positions covered a 23 to 41 yr time span for most knots, with a few
outer knots followed for almost 48 yr. We derive an expansion center of alpha =
23h 23m 27s.77 +- 0s.05, delta = 58d 48' 49".4 +- 0".4 (ICRS), with little
difference between centers derived using outer or main shell knots. This
position is 3.0 arcsec due north of that estimated by van den Bergh and Kamper
(1983). It also lies 6.6 +- 1.5 arcsec almost due north (PA = 354 deg) of the
remnant's recently-detected central X-ray point source, implying a transverse
velocity for the X-ray point source of about 330 km/s at a distance of 3.4 kpc.
Using the knots which lie out ahead of the remnant's forward blast wave, we
estimate a knot convergent date of A.D. 1671.3 +- 0.9, assuming no
deceleration. However, a deceleration of just approximately 1.6 km/(s yr) over
a 300 yr time span would produce an explosion date A.D. 1680, consistent with
the suspected sighting of the Cas A supernova by J. Flamsteed.
