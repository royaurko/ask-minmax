This is the written version of a lecture at the KITP workshop on Bits,
Branes, and Black Holes. In it I describe work with D. Harlow, S. Shenker, D.
Stanford which explains how the tree-like structure of eternal inflation,
together with the existence of terminal vacua, leads to an arrow-of-time.
Conformal symmetry of the dS/CFT type is inconsistent with an arrow-of-time and
must be broken. The presence in the landscape of terminal vacua leads to a new
kind of attractor called a fractal-flow, which both breaks conformal symmetry,
and creates a directional time-asymmetry. This can be seen from both the local
or causal-patch viewpoint, and also from the global or multiversal viewpoint.
The resulting picture is consistent with the view recently expressed by Bousso.
  In the last part of the lecture I illustrate how the tree-model can be useful
in explaining the value of the cosmological constant and the cosmic coincidence
problem. The mechanisms are not new but the description is.
