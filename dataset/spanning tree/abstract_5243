We use the results by Eisenbud and Schreyer to prove that any Betti diagram
of a graded module over a standard graded polynomial ring is a positive linear
combination Betti diagrams of modules with a pure resolution. This implies the
Multiplicity Conjecture of Herzog, Huneke and Srinivasan for modules that are
not necessarily Cohen-Macaulay. We give a combinatorial proof of the convexity
of the simplicial fan spanned by the pure diagrams.
