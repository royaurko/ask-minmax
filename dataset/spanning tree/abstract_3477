The prescription of Kawai, Lewellen and Tye for writing the closed string
tree amplitudes as sums of products of open string tree amplitudes, is applied
to the world sheet renormalization group equation. The main point is that
regularization of the Minkowski (rather than Euclidean) world sheet theory
allows factorization into left-moving and right-moving sectors to be
maintained. Explicit calculations are done for the tachyon and the
(gauge-fixed) graviton.
