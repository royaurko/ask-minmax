In this note, we investigate the tree pressure for multi-modal interval maps
with a certain class of hyperbolic and non-exceptional upper semi-continuous
functions. In particular, we obtain a generalized version of Corollary 2.2 in
the paper \cite{LRL14} by Li and Rivera-Letelier. This property will be used to
prove the existence of a conformal measure for the geometric potential in the
negative spectrum.
