We prove a new, tight upper bound on the number of incidences between points
and hyperplanes in Euclidean d-space. Given n points, of which k are colored
red, there are O_d(m^{2/3}k^{2/3}n^{(d-2)/3} + kn^{d-2} + m) incidences between
the k red points and m hyperplanes spanned by all n points provided that m =
\Omega(n^{d-2}). For the monochromatic case k = n, this was proved by Agarwal
and Aronov.
  We use this incidence bound to prove that a set of n points, no more than n-k
of which lie on any plane or two lines, spans \Omega(nk^2) planes. We also
provide an infinite family of counterexamples to a conjecture of Purdy's on the
number of hyperplanes spanned by a set of points in dimensions higher than 3,
and present new conjectures not subject to the counterexample.
