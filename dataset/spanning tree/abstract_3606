We study the ergodic theory of a multitype contact process with equal death
rates and unequal birth rates on the $d$-dimensional integer lattice and
regular trees. We prove that for birth rates in a certain interval there is
coexistence on the tree, which by a result of Neuhauser is not possible on the
lattice. We also prove a complete convergence result when the larger birth rate
falls outside of this interval.
