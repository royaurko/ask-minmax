Graph packing and partitioning problems have been studied in many contexts,
including from the algorithmic complexity perspective. Consider the packing
problem of determining whether a graph contains a spanning tree and a cycle
that do not share edges. Bern\'ath and Kir\'aly proved that this decision
problem is NP-complete and asked if the same result holds when restricting to
planar graphs. Similarly, they showed that the packing problem with a spanning
tree and a path between two distinguished vertices is NP-complete. They also
established the NP-completeness of the partitioning problem of determining
whether the edge set of a graph can be partitioned into a spanning tree and a
(not-necessarily spanning) tree. We prove that all three problems remain
NP-complete even when restricted to planar graphs.
