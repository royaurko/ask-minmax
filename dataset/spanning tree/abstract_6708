Let $\Gamma$ be geometric tree graph with $m$ edges and consider the second
order Sturm-Liouville operator $\L[u]=(-pu')'+qu$ acting on functions that are
continuous on all of $\Gamma$, and twice continuously differentiable in the
interior of each edge. The functions $p$ and $q$ are assumed uniformly
continuous on each edge, and $p$ strictly positive on $\Gamma$. The problem is
to find a solution $f:\Gamma \to \R$ to the problem $\L[f] = h$ with $2m$
additional conditions at the nodes of $\Gamma$. These node conditions include
continuity at internal nodes, and jump conditions on the derivatives of $f$
with respect to a positive measure $\rho$. Node conditions are given in the
form of linear functionals $\l_1,...,\l_{2m}$ acting on the space of admissible
functions. A novel formula is given for the Green's function $G:\Gamma\times
\Gamma \to \R$ associated to this problem. Namely, the solution to the
semi-homogenous problem $\L[f] = h$, $\l_i[f] =0$ for $i=1,...,2m$ is given by
$f(x) = \int_\Gamma G(x,y) h(y) \ud \rho$.
