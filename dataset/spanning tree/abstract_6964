One of the most prominent feature of research in Russia and the former Soviet
Union is so-called scientific schools. It is a collaboration of researchers
with a common scientific background working, as a rule, together in a specific
city or even at an institution. The genealogical tree of scientific schools on
nonlinear dynamics in Russia and the former Soviet Union is grown. We use these
terminology in a broad sense including theory of dynamical systems and chaos
and its applications in nonlinear physics. In most cases we connect two persons
if one was an advisor of the Doctoral thesis of another one. It is an analogue
of the Candidate of Science thesis in Russia. If the person had no official
advisor or we don't know exactly who was an advisor, we fix that person who was
known to be an informal teacher and has influenced on him/her very much.
