This paper is an attempt to shed new light on the notion of 'tree-like'
metric spaces by focusing on an approach without using the four-point
condition. The key question is: 'Given a metric space $M$ on $n$ points, when
does there exist such a fully-labelled positive-weighted tree $T$ on the same
$n$ vertices that precisely realises $M$ by its shortest path metric?' It is
proved that the spanning tree representation $T$ of $M$ is, if it exists,
isomorphic to the unique minimum spanning tree in the weighted complete graph
associated with $M$, and that a newly introduced fourth point condition is
necessary and sufficient to ensure the existence of $T$ whenever the distances
in $M$ are all different. In other words, a finite median graph with all
geodesic distances being distinct is nothing but a tree. Provided that the
assumption of tie-breaking holds, the fourth point condition serves as a
criterion for measuring the goodness-of-fit of the minimum spanning tree to
$M$, i.e., the spanning tree-likeness of $M$. It is also possible to evaluate
the spanning path-likeness of $M$. These quantities can be measured in $O(n^4)$
and in $O(n^3)$ time, respectively.
