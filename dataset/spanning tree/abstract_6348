We show how the gauge-invariance formulation given by Haberzettl is
implemented in practice for photoproduction amplitudes at the tree level with
form factors describing composite nucleons. We demonstrate that, in contrast to
Ohta's gauge-invariance prescription, this formalism allows electric current
contributions to be multiplied by a form factor, i.e., it does not require that
they be treated like bare currents. While different in detail, this
nevertheless lends support to previous ad hoc approaches which multiply the
Born amplitudes by an overall form factor. Numerical results for kaon
photoproduction off the nucleon are given. They show that the gauge procedure
by Haberzettl leads to much improved $\chi^2$ values as compared to Ohta's
prescription.
