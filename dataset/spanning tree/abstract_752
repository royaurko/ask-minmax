I find a topological arrangement of assets traded in a phonographic market
which has associated a meaningful economic taxonomy. I continue using the
Minimal Spanning Tree and the Life-time Of Correlations between assets, but now
outside the stock markets. This is the first attempt to use these methods on
phonographic market where we have artists instead of stocks. The value of an
artist is defined by record sales. The graph is obtained starting from the
matrix of correlations coefficient computed between the world's most popular 30
artists by considering the synchronous time evolution of the difference of the
logarithm of weekly record sales. This method provides the hierarchical
structure of phonographic market and information on which music genre is
meaningful according to customers.
