We introduce a new technique to bound the asymptotic performance of splay
trees. The basic idea is to transcribe, in an indirect fashion, the rotations
performed by the splay tree as a Davenport-Schinzel sequence S, none of whose
subsequences are isomorphic to fixed forbidden subsequence. We direct this
technique towards Tarjan's deque conjecture and prove that n deque operations
require O(n alpha^*(n)) time, where alpha^*(n) is the minimum number of
applications of the inverse-Ackermann function mapping n to a constant. We are
optimistic that this approach could be directed towards other open conjectures
on splay trees such as the traversal and split conjectures.
