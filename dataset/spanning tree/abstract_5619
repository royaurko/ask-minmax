The dynamics of the tilted Bianchi IX cosmological models are explored
allowing energy flux in the source fluid. The equation of state and the tilt
angle of the fluid are the two free parameters and the shear, the vorticity and
the curvature of the spacetime span a three-dimensional phase space that
contains seven fixed points. One of them is an attractor that inflates the
universe anisotropically, thus providing a counter example to the cosmic
no-hair conjecture. Also, an example of a realistic though fine-tuned cosmology
is presented wherein the rotation can grow significant towards the present
epoch but the shear stays within the observational bounds.
