Comparative studies of the resonant transmission of light in the vicinity of
exciton resonances, measured for 15 few-micron GaAs crystal slabs with
different impurity concentrations $N$, reveal an unexpected tendency. While $N$
spans almost five decimal orders of magnitude, the normalized
spectrally-integrated absorption of light scales with the impurity
concentration as $N^{1/6}$. We show analytically that this dependence is a
signature of the diffusive mechanism of propagation of exciton-polaritons in
the semiconductor.
