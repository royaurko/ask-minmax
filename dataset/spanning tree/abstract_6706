In the fields of finance, engineering and sciences data mining/ machine
learning has held an eminent position in predictive analysis. Complex
algorithms and adaptive decision models have contributed towards streamlining
research as well as improve forecasting. Extensive study in areas surrounding
computation and mathematical sciences has primarily been responsible for the
field's development. Classification based modeling, which holds a prominent
position amongst the different rule-based algorithms, is one of the most widely
used decision making tool. The decision tree has a place of profound
significance in classification modeling. A number of heuristics have been
developed over the years to refine its decision making process. Most heuristics
applied to such tree-based learning algorithms derive their roots from
Shannon's 'Information Theory'. The current application of this theory is
directed towards individual assessment of the attribute-values. The proposed
study takes a look at the effects of combining these values with the aim to
improve the 'Information Gain'. A search-based heuristic tool is applied for
identifying the subsets sharing a better gain value than the ones presented in
the GID3 approach. An application towards the feature selection stage of the
mining process has been tested and presented with statistical analysis.
