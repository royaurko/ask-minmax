Herbrand's theorem is one of the most fundamental insights in logic. From the
syntactic point of view it suggests a compact representation of proofs in
classical first- and higher-order logic by recording the information which
instances have been chosen for which quantifiers, known in the literature as
expansion trees.
  Such a representation is inherently analytic and hence corresponds to a
cut-free sequent calculus proof. Recently several extensions of such proof
representations to proofs with cut have been proposed. These extensions are
based on graphical formalisms similar to proof nets and are limited to prenex
formulas.
  In this paper we present a new approach that directly extends expansion trees
by cuts and covers also non-prenex formulas. We describe a cut-elimination
procedure for our expansion trees with cut that is based on the natural
reduction steps. We prove that it is weakly normalizing using methods from the
epsilon-calculus.
