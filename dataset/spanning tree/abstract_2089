Connected operators are filtering tools that act by merging elementary
regions of an image. A popular strategy is based on tree-based image
representations: for example, one can compute an attribute on each node of the
tree and keep only the nodes for which the attribute is sufficiently strong.
This operation can be seen as a thresholding of the tree, seen as a graph whose
nodes are weighted by the attribute. Rather than being satisfied with a mere
thresholding, we propose to expand on this idea, and to apply connected filters
on this latest graph. Consequently, the filtering is done not in the space of
the image, but on the space of shapes build from the image. Such a processing
is a generalization of the existing tree-based connected operators. Indeed, the
framework includes classical existing connected operators by attributes. It
also allows us to propose a class of novel connected operators from the
leveling family, based on shape attributes. Finally, we also propose a novel
class of self-dual connected operators that we call morphological shapings.
