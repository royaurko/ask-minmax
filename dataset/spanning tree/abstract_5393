In [The smallest one-realization of a given set, Electronic J. Combin. 19
(2012), $\sharp$P19], we determined the minimum number of vertices of
one-realizations of a given finite set $S$, and constructed the corresponding
mixed hypergraphs. In this paper, by finding some of their spanning
sub-hypergraphs, we determine the minimum number of ${\cal D}$-deges (resp.
${\cal C}$-edges) of one-realizations of $S$. As a result, we partially solve
an open problem proposed by Tuza and Voloshin in 2008.
