A locally SU(2)xU(1)-invariant term of dimension six with effective
interactions of the electroweak gauge and Higgs fields is examined. This term
also contains higher derivatives of the fields. It yields nonstandard quartic
gauge-boson self-interactions but neither nonstandard cubic self-interactions
nor tree-level effects on presently measurable quantities.
