A universal cycle is a compact listing of a class of combinatorial objects.
In this paper, we prove the existence of universal cycles of classes of labeled
graphs, including simple graphs, trees, graphs with m edges, graphs with loops,
graphs with multiple edges (with up to m duplications of each edge), directed
graphs, hypergraphs, and k-uniform hypergraphs.
