We study the magnetization dynamics of spin valve structures with a free
composite synthetic ferromagnet (SyF) that consists of two ferromagnetic layers
coupled through a normal metal spacer. A ferromagnetically coupled SyF can be
excited into dynamical precessional states by an applied current without
external magnetic fields. We analytically determine the stability of these
states in the space spanned by the current density and SyF interlayer exchange
coupling. Numerical simulations confirm our analytical results.
