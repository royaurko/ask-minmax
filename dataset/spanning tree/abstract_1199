The Wiener index of a connected graph is the sum of topological distances
between all pairs of vertices. Since Wang gave a mistake result on the maximum
Wiener index for given tree degree sequence, in this paper, we investigate the
maximum Wiener index of trees with given degree sequences and extremal trees
which attain the maximum value.
