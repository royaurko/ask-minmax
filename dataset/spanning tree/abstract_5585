A measurement is presented of single- and double-differential dijet cross
sections in diffractive deep-inelastic $ep$ scattering at HERA using data
collected by the H1 experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 290
pb^{-1}. The investigated phase space is spanned by the photon virtuality in
the range of 4<Q^{2}<100 GeV^{2} and by the fractional proton longitudinal
momentum loss x_pom<0.03. The resulting cross sections are compared with
next-to-leading order QCD predictions based on diffractive parton distribution
functions and the value of the strong coupling constant is extracted.
