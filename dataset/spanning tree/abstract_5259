The high accuracy and long time span of photoelectric observations allow them
to be used for multifactor analyses and refining some of the "fine" photometric
effects in the light curves of close binary systems. The results obtained can
be subsequently interpreted in terms of the model of mass flow from the optical
component of the close binary systems onto the accretion disk of the neutron
star, which can explain satisfactorily the irregularities of the gaseous flow,
the "hot spot", and the presence of splashes moving in individual Keplerian
trajectories about the outer parts of the accretion disk of the neutron star
