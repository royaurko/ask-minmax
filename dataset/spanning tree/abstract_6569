We classify the Ext-quivers of hearts in the bounded derived category D(A_n)
and the finite-dimensional derived category D(\Gamma_N A_n) of the Calabi-Yau-N
Ginzburg algebra D(\Gamma_N A_n). This provides the classification for
Buan-Thomas' colored quiver for higher clusters of A-type. We also give
explicit combinatorial constructions from a binary tree with n+2 leaves to a
torsion pair in mod k\overrightarrow{A_n} and a cluster tilting set in the
corresponding cluster category, for the straight oriented A-type quiver
\overrightarrow{A_n}. As an application, we show that the orientation of the
n-dimensional ssociahedron induced by poset structure of binary trees coincides
with the orientation induced by poset structure of torsion pairs in mod
k\overrightarrow{A_n} (under the correspondence above).
