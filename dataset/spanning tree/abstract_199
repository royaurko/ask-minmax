Given a graph and a root, the Maximum Bounded Rooted-Tree Packing (MBRTP)
problem aims at finding K rooted-trees that span the largest subset of
vertices, when each vertex has a limited outdegree. This problem is motivated
by peer-to-peer streaming overlays in under-provisioned systems. We prove that
the MBRTP problem is NP-complete. We present two polynomial-time algorithms
that computes an optimal solution on complete graphs and trees respectively.
