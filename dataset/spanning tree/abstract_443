Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose closure
$\overline{\Omega}$ is polyhedral, and let $\mathcal{T}$ be a triangulation of
$\overline{\Omega}$. Assuming that the boundary of $\Omega$ is sufficiently
regular, we provide an explicit formula for the computation of homological
Seifert surfaces of any $1$-boundary $\gamma$ of $\mathcal{T}$; namely,
$2$-chains of $\mathcal{T}$ whose boundary is $\gamma$. It is based on the
existence of special spanning trees of the complete dual graph of
$\mathcal{T}$, and on the computation of certain linking numbers associated
with those spanning trees. If the triangulation $\mathcal{T}$ is fine, the
explicit formula is too expensive to be used directly. For this reason, making
also use of a simple elimination procedure, we devise a fast algorithm for the
computation of homological Seifert surfaces. Some numerical experiments
illustrate the efficiency of this algorithm.
