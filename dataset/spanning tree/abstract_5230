The time-evolution operator for the kicked Harper model is reduced to block
matrix form when the effective Planck's constant hbar = 2 pi M/N and M and N
are integers. Each block matrix is spanned by an orthonormal set of N "kq"
(quasi-position/quasi-momentum) functions. This implies that the system's
eigenfunctions or stationary states are necessarily discrete and periodic. The
reduction allows, for the first time, an examination of the 2-dimensional
structure of the system's quasi-energy spectrum and the study of, with
unprecedented accuracy, the system's stationary states.
