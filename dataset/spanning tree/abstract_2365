A grounded M-Lipschitz function on a rooted d-ary tree is an integer-valued
map on the vertices that changes by at most along edges and attains the value
zero on the leaves. We study the behavior of such functions, specifically,
their typical value at the root v_0 of the tree. We prove that the probability
that the value of a uniformly chosen random function at v_0 is more than M+t is
doubly-exponentially small in t. We also show a similar bound for continuous
(real-valued) grounded Lipschitz functions.
