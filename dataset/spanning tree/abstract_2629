This paper surveys the results of recent collaborations with Eric Derbez and
with Takashi Hara, which show that intergrated super-Brownian excursion (ISE)
arises as the scaling limit of both lattice trees and the incipient infinite
percolation cluster, in high dimensions. A potential extension to oriented
percolation is also mentioned.
