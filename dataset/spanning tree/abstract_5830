Let $\CRF_S$ denote the category of $S$-colored rooted forests, and
$\H_{\CRF_S}$ denote its Ringel-Hall algebra as introduced in \cite{KS}. We
construct a homomorphism from a $K^+_0 (\CRF_S)$--graded version of the Hopf
algebra of noncommutative symmetric functions to $\H_{\CRF_S}$. Dualizing, we
obtain a homomorphism from the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra to a $K^+_0
(\CRF_S)$--graded version of the algebra of quasisymmetric functions. This
homomorphism is a refinement of one considered by W. Zhao in \cite{Z}.
