For a lattice $\Lambda$ with $n$ vertices and dimension $d$ equal or higher
than two, the number of spanning trees $N_{ST}(\Lambda)$ grows asymptotically
as $\exp(n z_\Lambda)$ in the thermodynamic limit. We present exact integral
expressions for the asymptotic growth constant $z_\Lambda$ for spanning trees
on several lattices. By taking different unit cells in the calculation, many
integration identities can be obtained. We also give $z_{\Lambda (p)}$ on the
homeomorphic expansion of $k$-regular lattices with $p$ vertices inserted on
each edge.
