We define the Hopf algebra structure on the Grothendieck group of
finite-dimensional polynomial representations of $U_q \hat{gl}_N$ in the limit
$N \to \infty$. The resulting Hopf algebra $Rep U_q \hat{gl}_\infty$ is a
tensor product of its Hopf subalgebras $Rep_a U_q \hat{gl}_\infty$,
$a\in\C^\times/q^{2\Z}$. When $q$ is generic (resp., $q^2$ is a primitive root
of unity of order $l$), we construct an isomorphism between the Hopf algebra
$Rep_a U_q \hat{gl}_\infty$ and the algebra of regular functions on the
prounipotent proalgebraic group $SL_\infty^-$ (resp., $\tilde{GL}_l^-$). When
$q$ is a root of unity, this isomorphism identifies the Hopf subalgebra of
$Rep_a U_q \hat{gl}_\infty$ spanned by the modules obtained by pullback with
respect to the Frobenius homomorphism with the algebra generated by the
coefficients of the determinant of an element of $\tilde{GL}_l^-$. This gives
us an explicit formula for the Frobenius pullbacks of the fundamental
representations. In addition, we construct a natural action of the Hall algebra
associated to the infinite linear quiver (resp., the cyclic quiver with $l$
vertices) on $Rep_a U_q \hat{gl}_infty$ and describe the span of the tensor
products of the evaluation representations taken at fixed points as a module
over this Hall algebra.
