The thickness $\theta(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of planar
spanning subgraphs into which the graph $G$ can be decomposed. It is a
topological invariant of a graph, which was defined by W.T. Tutte in 1963 and
also has important applications to VLSI design. But comparing with other
topological invariants, e.g. genus and crossing number, results about thickness
of graphs are few. The only types of graphs whose thicknesses have been
obtained are complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs and hypercubes. In this
paper, by operations on graphs, the thickness of the cartesian product $K_n
\Box P_m$, $n,m \geq 2$ are obtained.
