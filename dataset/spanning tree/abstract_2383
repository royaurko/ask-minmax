In this paper we present a procedure to build the set of irreducible
numerical semigroups with a fixed Frobenius number. The construction gives us a
rooted tree structure for this set. Furthermore, by using the notion of
Kunz-coordinates vector we translate the problem of finding such a tree into
the problem of manipulating 0-1 vectors with as many component as the Frobenius
number.
