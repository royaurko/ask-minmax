We show that if a group G acts isometrically on a locally finite leafless
R-tree inducing a two-transitive action on its ends, then this tree is
determined by the action of G on the boundary. As a corollary we obtain that
locally finite Euclidean buildings without tree or cone factors are determined
by their complete building at infinity.
