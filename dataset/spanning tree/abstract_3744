We introduce an efficient method for training the linear ranking support
vector machine. The method combines cutting plane optimization with red-black
tree based approach to subgradient calculations, and has O(m*s+m*log(m)) time
complexity, where m is the number of training examples, and s the average
number of non-zero features per example. Best previously known training
algorithms achieve the same efficiency only for restricted special cases,
whereas the proposed approach allows any real valued utility scores in the
training data. Experiments demonstrate the superior scalability of the proposed
approach, when compared to the fastest existing RankSVM implementations.
