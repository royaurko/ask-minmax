We exhibit an identity of abstract simplicial complexes between the
well-studied complex of trees and the reduced minimal nested set complex of the
partition lattice. We conclude that the order complex of the partition lattice
can be obtained from the complex of trees by a sequence of stellar
subdivisions. We provide an explicit cohomology basis for the complex of trees
that emerges naturally from this context.
  Motivated by these results, we review the generalization of complexes of
trees to complexes of $k$-trees by Hanlon, and we propose yet another, in the
context of nested set complexes more natural, generalization.
