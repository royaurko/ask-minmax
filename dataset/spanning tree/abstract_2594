We show that the set of Schur idempotents with hyperreflexive range is a
Boolean lattice which contains all contractions. We establish a preservation
result for sums which implies that the weak* closed span of a hyperreflexive
and a ternary masa-bimodule is hyperreflexive, and prove that the weak* closed
span of finitely many tensor products of a hyperreflexive space and a
hyperreflexive range of a Schur idempotent (respectively, a ternary
masa-bimodule) is hyperreflexive.
