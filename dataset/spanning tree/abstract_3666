We calculate analytically tree level amplitudes for Higgs production via Weak
Bosons Fusion (WBF) and QCD corrections to the Standard Model prediction (SM)
by using the helicity spinor formalism. We provide the explicit expression for
the amplitude with two gluons emission in the final state together with
massless final two quarks. The massive generalization of the
Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) recursion scheme is applied successfully
obtaining compact results which agree with, and overcome in simplicity, the
conventional Feynman diagrams approach.
