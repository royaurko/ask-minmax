We introduce a simple tree growth process that gives rise to a new
two-parameter family of discrete fragmentation trees that extends Ford's alpha
model to multifurcating trees and includes the trees obtained by uniform
sampling from Duquesne and Le Gall's stable continuum random tree. We call
these new trees the alpha-gamma trees. In this paper, we obtain their splitting
rules, dislocation measures both in ranked order and in sized-biased order, and
we study their limiting behaviour.
