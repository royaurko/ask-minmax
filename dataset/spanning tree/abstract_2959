Michael Somos conjectured a relation between Hankel determinants whose
entries $\frac 1{2n+1}\binom{3n}n$ count ternary trees and the number of
certain plane partitions and alternating sign matrices. Tamm evaluated these
determinants by showing that the generating function for these entries has a
continued fraction that is a special case of Gauss's continued fraction for a
quotient of hypergeometric series. We give a systematic application of the
continued fraction method to a number of similar Hankel determinants. We also
describe a simple method for transforming determinants using the generating
function for their entries. In this way we transform Somos's Hankel
determinants to known determinants, and we obtain, up to a power of 3, a Hankel
determinant for the number of alternating sign matrices. We obtain a
combinatorial proof, in terms of nonintersecting paths, of determinant
identities involving the number of ternary trees and more general determinant
identities involving the number of $r$-ary trees.
