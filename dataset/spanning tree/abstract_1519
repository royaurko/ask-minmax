For a martingale $(X_n)$ converging almost surely to a random variable $X$,
the sequence $(X_n - X)$ is called martingale tail sum. Recently, Neininger
[Random Structures Algorithms, 46 (2015), 346-361] proved a central limit
theorem for the martingale tail sum of R{\'e}gnier's martingale for the path
length in random binary search trees. Gr{\"u}bel and Kabluchko [2014, preprint,
arXiv 1410.0469] gave an alternative proof also conjecturing a corresponding
law of the iterated logarithm. We prove the central limit theorem with
convergence of higher moments and the law of the iterated logarithm for a
family of trees containing binary search trees, recursive trees and
plane-oriented recursive trees.
