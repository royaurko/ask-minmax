A lattice diagram is a finite list L=((p_1,q_1),...,(p_n,q_n) of lattice
cells. The corresponding lattice diagram determinant is \Delta_L(X;Y)=\det \|
x_i^{p_j}y_i^{q_j} \|. These lattice diagram determinants are crucial in the
study of the so-called ``n! conjecture'' of A. Garsia and M. Haiman. The space
M_L is the space spanned by all partial derivatives of \Delta_L(X;Y). The
``shift operators'', which are particular partial symmetric derivative
operators are very useful in the comprehension of the structure of the M_L
spaces. We describe here how a Schur function partial derivative operator acts
on lattice diagrams with distinct cells in the positive quadrant.
