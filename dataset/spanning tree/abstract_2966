Reticulate events play an important role in determining evolutionary
relationships. The problem of computing the minimum number of such events to
explain discordance between two phylogenetic trees is a hard computational
problem. Even for binary trees, exact solvers struggle to solve instances with
reticulation number larger than 40-50. Here we present CycleKiller and
NonbinaryCycleKiller, the first methods to produce solutions verifiably close
to optimality for instances with hundreds or even thousands of reticulations.
Using simulations, we demonstrate that these algorithms run quickly for large
and difficult instances, producing solutions that are very close to optimality.
As a spin-off from our simulations we also present TerminusEst, which is the
fastest exact method currently available that can handle nonbinary trees: this
is used to measure the accuracy of the NonbinaryCycleKiller algorithm. All
three methods are based on extensions of previous theoretical work and are
publicly available. We also apply our methods to real data.
