We present and prove a formula for the MHV scattering amplitude of n
gravitons at tree level. Some of the more interesting features of the formula,
which set it apart as being significantly different from many more familiar
formulas, include the absence of any vestigial reference to a cyclic ordering
of the gravitons--making it in a sense a truly gravitational formula, rather
than a recycled Yang-Mills result, and the fact that it simultaneously
manifests both S_{n-2} symmetry as well as large-z behavior that is O(1/z^2)
term-by-term, without relying on delicate cancellations. The formula is
seemingly related to others by an enormous simplification provided by O(n^n)
iterated Schouten identities, but our proof relies on a complex analysis
argument rather than such a brute force manipulation. We find that the formula
has a very simple link representation in twistor space, where cancellations
that are non-obvious in physical space become manifest.
