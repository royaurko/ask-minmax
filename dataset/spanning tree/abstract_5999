The evolution of the shape and size of the ejecta of SN 1987A is analyzed
over a period of ~ 8 years based on HST images and spectra taken between 1278
and 4336 days after the supernova outburst. We combine both proprietary and
archival HST data obtained with the FOC, WFPC2 and STIS. The low resolution
near-UV prism FOC spectrum obtained at day 3043 has not been described
previously. Although the FWHM of the ejecta grew linearly over the time span
studied, the appearance of the SN envelope also changed markedly with
wavelength. At visible wavelengths (lambda ~ 5000 Angstrom) the ejecta became
progressively more elongated, reaching an ellipticity epsilon ~ 0.25 by day
4000. In the near-UV (lambda ~ 2500 AA), the ejecta remained closely circular
(epsilon <= 0.1) and ~ 50% larger in angular extent than in the visible. The
FOC prism observations show that the large extent of the SN envelope is
confined to a grouping of resonance lines spanning Mg I 2852, Mg II 2795,2802
and several Fe II multiplets -- thereby confirming that the larger size of the
debris in the near-UV is due to scattering in these optically thick transitions
compared to the optically thin forbidden and semi-forbidden transitions that
dominate the visible spectrum. The available data are not of sufficient quality
to detect the slight deviation from linear expansion expected for the outermost
regions of the near-UV images as predicted by Chugai et al. (1997).
