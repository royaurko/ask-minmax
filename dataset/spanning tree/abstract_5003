We present an analysis of the timing data of the pulsar B1642-03, collected
over a span of 30 years between 1969 and 1999. During this interval, the timing
residuals exhibit cyclical changes with amplitude varying from 15 ms to 80 ms
and spacing of maxima varying from 3 years to 7 years. Interpretation of these
observed cyclical changes in terms of free precession suggests a wobble angle
of about 0.8 degrees.
