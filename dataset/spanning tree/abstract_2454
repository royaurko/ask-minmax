Efficient implementations of sets and maps (dictionaries) are important in
computer science, and balanced binary search trees are the basis of the best
practical implementations. Pedagogically, however, they are often quite
complicated, especially with respect to deletion. I present complete code (with
justification and analysis not previously available in the literature) for a
purely-functional implementation based on AA trees, which is the simplest
treatment of the subject of which I am aware.
