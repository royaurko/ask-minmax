In this article we study C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras associated with
locally compact non-discrete groups acting on trees. After formulating an
locally compact analogue of Powers' property, we prove that the reduced group
C*-algebra of certain groups acting on trees is simple. This is the first
simplicity result for C*-algebra of non-discrete groups and answers a question
of de la Harpe. We complement this result by showing that every C*-simple group
must be totally disconnected. We also consider group von Neumann algebras of
certain non-discrete groups acting on trees. We prove factoriality, determine
their type and show non-amenability. We end the article by giving natural
examples of groups satisfying the hypotheses of our work.
