It is a classical result that any finite tree with positively weighted edges,
and without vertices of degree 2, is uniquely determined by the weighted path
distance between each pair of leaves. Moreover, it is possible for a (small)
strict subset $\cl$ of leaf pairs to suffice for reconstructing the tree and
its edge weights, given just the distances between the leaf pairs in $\cl$. It
is known that any set $\cl$ with this property for a tree in which all interior
vertices have degree 3 must form a {\em cover} for $T$ -- that is, for each
interior vertex $v$ of $T$, $\cl$ must contain a pair of leaves from each pair
of the three components of $T-v$. Here we provide a partial converse of this
result by showing that if a set $\cl$ of leaf pairs forms a cover of a certain
type for such a tree $T$ then $T$ and its edge weights can be uniquely
determined from the distances between the pairs of leaves in $\cl$. Moreover,
there is a polynomial-time algorithm for achieving this reconstruction. The
result establishes a special case of a recent question concerning `triplet
covers', and is relevant to a problem arising in evolutionary genomics.
