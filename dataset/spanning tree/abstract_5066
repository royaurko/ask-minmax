We investigate by exact optimization the geometrical properties of
three-dimensional elastic line systems with point disorder and hard-core
repulsion. The line 'forests' become entangled due to increasing line wandering
as the system height is increased, at fixed line density. There is a transition
height at which a cluster of pairwise entangled lines spans the system,
transverse to average line orientation. Numerical evidence implies that the
phenomenon is in the ordinary percolation universality class.
