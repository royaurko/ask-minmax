Supersymmetry without R-parity predicts tree level quark flavor violation. We
present a potential signal of single bottom production at electron-positron
colliders with energies in the range 6 to 20 GeV. Taking into account rare
decay limits it should be detectable with the current BaBar and Belle data
samples.
