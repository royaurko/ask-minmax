We study hypercyclicity, Devaney chaos, topological mixing properties and
strong mixing in the measure-theoretic sense for operators on topological
vector spaces with invariant sets. More precisely, our purpose is to establish
links between the fact of satisfying any of these properties on certain
invariant sets, and the analogous property on the closed span of the invariant
set. We also give examples that illustrate these results.
