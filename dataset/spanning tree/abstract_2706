We consider the calculation of n-point multigluon tree amplitudes with a pair
of massive fermions in QCD. We give the explicit transformation rules of this
kind of massive fermion-pair amplitudes with respect to different reference
momenta and check the correctness of them by SUSY Ward identities. Using these
rules and onshell BCFW recursion relation, we calculate the analytic results of
several n-point multigluon amplitudes.
