A forcing poset of size 2^{2^{aleph_1}} which adds no new reals is described
and shown to provide a Delta^2_2 definable well-order of the reals (in fact,
any given relation of the reals may be so encoded in some generic extension).
The encoding of this well-order is obtained by playing with products of
Aronszajn trees: Some products are special while other are Suslin trees. The
paper also deals with the Magidor-Malitz logic: it is consistent that this
logic is highly non compact.
