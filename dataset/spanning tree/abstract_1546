We provide an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret rate in an unknown
weakly communicating Markov Decision Process (MDP). The algorithm proceeds in
episodes where, in each episode, it picks a policy using regularization based
on the span of the optimal bias vector. For an MDP with S states and A actions
whose optimal bias vector has span bounded by H, we show a regret bound of
~O(HSpAT). We also relate the span to various diameter-like quantities
associated with the MDP, demonstrating how our results improve on previous
regret bounds.
