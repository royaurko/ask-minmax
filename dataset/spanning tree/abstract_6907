This paper deals with those positive integers N such that, for given integers
g and k with 1< k<g, the base-g digits of N and kN appear in reverse order.
Such N are called (g, k) reverse multiples. Anne Ludington Young, in 1992,
developed a kind of tree reflecting properties of these numbers; N. J. A.
Sloane, in 2013, modified these trees into directed graphs and introduced
certain combinatoric methods to determine from these graphs the number of
reverse multiples for given values of g and k with a given number of digits. We
extend their work, proving Sloane's isomorphism conjectures for 1089 graphs and
complete graphs, furthering his study of cyclic graphs, and proving a minor
result on isomorphism.
