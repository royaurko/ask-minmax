The theme of this article is the algebraic combinatorics of leaf-labeled
rooted binary trees and forests of such trees. The structure of a Hopf operad
is defined on the vector spaces spanned by forests of leaf-labeled, rooted,
binary trees. An explicit formula for the coproduct and its dual product is
given, using a poset on forests.
