We show for an alternating knot the minimal boundary slope of an essential
spanning surface is given by the signature plus twice the minimum degree of the
Jones polynomial and the maximal boundary slope of an essential spanning
surface is given by the signature plus twice the maximum degree of the Jones
polynomial. For alternating Montesinos knots, these are the minimal and maximal
boundary slopes.
