In 2003 Bieri and Geoghegan generalized the Bieri-Neuman-Strebel invariant
$\Sigma^1$ by defining $\Sigma^1(\rho)$, $\rho$ an isometric action by a
finitely generated group $G$ on a proper CAT(0) space $M$. In this paper, we
show how the natural and well-known connection between Bass-Serre theory and
covering space theory provides a framework for the calculation of
$\Sigma^1(\rho)$ when $\rho$ is a cocompact action by $G = B \rtimes A$, $A$ a
finitely generated group, on a locally finite Bass-Serre tree $T$ for $A$. This
framework leads to a theorem providing conditions for including an endpoint in,
or excluding an endpoint from, $\Sigma^1(\rho)$. When $A$ is a finitely
generated free group acting on its Cayley graph, we can restate this theorem
from a more algebraic perspective, which leads to some general results on
$\Sigma^1$ for such actions.
