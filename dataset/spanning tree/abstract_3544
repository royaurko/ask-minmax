We study the global and local regularity properties of random wavelet series
whose coefficients exhibit correlations given by a tree-indexed Markov chain.
We determine the law of the spectrum of singularities of these series, thereby
performing their multifractal analysis. We also show that almost every sample
path displays an oscillating singularity at almost every point and that the
points at which a sample path has at most a given Holder exponent form a set
with large intersection.
