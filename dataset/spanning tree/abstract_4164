We study several statistical mechanical models on a general tree. Particular
attention is devoted to the classical Heisenberg models, where the state space
is the d-dimensional unit sphere and the interactions are proportional to the
cosines of the angles between neighboring spins. The phenomenon of interest
here is the classification of phase transition (non-uniqueness of the Gibbs
state) according to whether it is robust. In many cases, including all of the
Heisenberg and Potts models, occurrence of robust phase transition is
determined by the geometry (branching number) of the tree in a way that
parallels the situation with independent percolation and usual phase transition
for the Ising model. The critical values for robust phase transition for the
Heisenberg and Potts models are also calculated exactly. In some cases, such as
the q>=3 Potts model, robust phase transition and usual phase transition do not
coincide, while in other cases, such as the Heisenberg models, we conjecture
that robust phase transition and usual phase transition are equivalent. In
addition, we show that symmetry breaking is equivalent to the existence of a
phase transition, a fact believed but not known for the rotor model on Z^2.
