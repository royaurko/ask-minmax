A rational linear combination of Chern numbers is an oriented diffeomorphism
invariant of smooth complex projective varieties if and only if it is a linear
combination of the Euler and Pontryagin numbers. In dimension at least three
only multiples of the top Chern number, which is the Euler characteristic, are
invariant under diffeomorphisms that are not necessarily
orientation-preserving. In the space of Chern numbers there are two
distinguished subspaces, one spanned by the Euler and Pontryagin numbers, the
other spanned by the Hirzebruch--Todd numbers. Their intersection is the span
of the Euler number and the signature.
