By considering the finite mass of Fraternite, although small, it is shown
that there are two time averaged stationary points in its neighborhood due to
the reaction of the test body to the fields of Neptune, Galatea, and
Fraternite. These two locations measuring 11.7 and 13.8 degrees from the center
of Fraternite could correspond to the locations of Egalite 2 and Egalite 1.
This model accounts for the 10 degree span of Fraternite and estimates its mass
at $m_{f}=6.4\times 10^{16}$ Kg. The eccentricities of Egalite 2 and Egalite 1
are believed to be about $e=5\times 10^{-4}$.
