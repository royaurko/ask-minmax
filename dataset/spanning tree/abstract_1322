Additive regression trees are flexible non-parametric models and popular
off-the-shelf tools for real-world non-linear regression. In application
domains, such as bioinformatics, where there is also demand for probabilistic
predictions with measures of uncertainty, the Bayesian additive regression
trees (BART) model, introduced by Chipman et al. (2010), is increasingly
popular. As data sets have grown in size, however, the standard
Metropolis-Hastings algorithms used to perform inference in BART are proving
inadequate. In particular, these Markov chains make local changes to the trees
and suffer from slow mixing when the data are high-dimensional or the best
fitting trees are more than a few layers deep. We present a novel sampler for
BART based on the Particle Gibbs (PG) algorithm (Andrieu et al., 2010) and a
top-down particle filtering algorithm for Bayesian decision trees
(Lakshminarayanan et al., 2013). Rather than making local changes to individual
trees, the PG sampler proposes a complete tree to fit the residual. Experiments
show that the PG sampler outperforms existing samplers in many settings.
