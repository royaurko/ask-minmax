We introduce a high-performance implementation of a loosely coherent
statistic sensitive to signals spanning a finite-dimensional manifold in
parameter space. Results from full scale simulations on Gaussian noise are
discussed, as well as implications for future searches for continuous
gravitational waves. We demonstrate an improvement of more than an order of
magnitude in analysis speed over previously available algorithms. As searches
for continuous gravitational waves are computationally limited, the large
speedup results in gain in sensitivity.
