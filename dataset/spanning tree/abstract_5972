We introduce a notion of absolute non-free action and show that every weakly
branch group acts absolutely non-freely on the boundary of the associated
rooted tree. Using this result and the symmetrized diagonal actions we show
that every branch group has at least countably many different ergodic totally
non-free actions (in the terminology of Vershik) and therefore at least
countably many II_1 factor representations.
