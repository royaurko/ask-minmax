An explicit family of Folner sets is constructed for some directed groups
acting on a rooted tree of sublogarithmic valency by alternate permutations. In
the case of bounded valency, these groups were known to be amenable by
probabilistic methods. The present construction provides a new and independent
proof of amenability, using neither random walks, nor word length.
