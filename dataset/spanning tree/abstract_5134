We study a pair of commuting difference operators arising from the elliptic
C_2^{(1)}-face model. The operators, whose coefficients are expressed in terms
of the Jacobi's elliptic theta function, act on the space of meromorphic
functions on the weight space of the C_2 type simple Lie algebra. We show that
the space of functions spanned by the level one characters of the affine Lie
algebra sp(4,C) is invariant under the action of the difference operators.
