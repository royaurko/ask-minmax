We characterize trees as median algebras and semilattices by relaxing
conservativeness. Moreover, we describe median homomorphisms between products
of median algebras and show that Arrow type impossibility theorems for mappings
from a product $\mathbf{A}_1\times \cdots \times \mathbf{A}_n$ of median
algebras to a median algebra $\mathbf{B}$ are possible if and only if
$\mathbf{B}$ is a tree, when thought of as an ordered structure.
