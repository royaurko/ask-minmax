Let $X$ be a smooth complex projective variety and let $H \in \pic(X)$ be an
ample line bundle. Assume that $X$ is covered by rational curves with degree
one with respect to $H$ and with anticanonical degree greater than or equal to
$(\dim X -1)/2$. We prove that there is a covering family of such curves whose
numerical class spans an extremal ray in the cone of curves $\cone(X)$.
