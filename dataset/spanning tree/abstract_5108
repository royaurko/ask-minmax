A unification model for strong, electromagnetic, weak and gravitational
forces is proposed. The tangent space of ordinary coordinate 4-dimensional
spacetime is a submanifold of an 14-dimensional internal spacetime spanned by
four frame fields. The unification of the standard model with gravity is
governed by gauge symmetry in the internal spacetime.
