We develop a tree method for multidimensional q-Hahn polynomials. We define
them as eigenfunctions of a multidimensional q-difference operator and we use
the factorization of this operator as a key tool. Then we define
multidimensional q-Racah polynomials as the connection coefficients between
different bases of q-Hahn polynomials. We show that our multidimensional
q-Racah polynomials may be expressed as product of ordinary one-dimensional
q-Racah polynomial by means of a suitable sequence of transplantations of edges
of the trees.
