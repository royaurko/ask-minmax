We encode a certain class of stochastic fragmentation processes, namely
self-similar fragmentation processes with a negative index of self-similarity,
into a metric family tree which belongs to the family of Continuum Random Trees
of Aldous. When the splitting times of the fragmentation are dense near 0, the
tree can in turn be encoded into a continuous height function, just as the
Brownian Continuum Random Tree is encoded in a normalized Brownian excursion.
Under mild hypotheses, we then compute the Hausdorff dimensions of these trees,
and the maximal H\"older exponents of the height functions.
