Context-dependent nature of biological phenomena are well documented in every
branch of biology. While there have been few previous attempts to (implicitly)
model various facets of biological context-dependence, a formal and general
mathematical construct to model the wide spectrum of context-dependence, eludes
the students of biology. An objective and rigorous model, from both 'bottom-up'
as well as 'top-down' perspective, is proposed here to serve as the template to
describe the various kinds of context-dependence that we encounter in different
branches of biology. Interactions between biological contexts was found to be
transitive but non-commutative. It is found that a hierarchical nature of
dependence amongst the biological contexts models the emergent biological
properties efficiently. Reasons for these findings are provided with a general
model to describe biological reality. Scheme to algorithmically implement the
hierarchic structure of organization of biological contexts was achieved with a
construct named 'Context tree'. A 'Context tree' based analysis of context
interactions among biophysical factors influencing protein structure was
performed.
