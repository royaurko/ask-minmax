We present the first calculation of two-quark and five-gluon tree amplitudes
using on-shell recursion relations. These amplitudes are needed for tree level
5-jet cross-section and an essential ingredient for next-to-leading order 4-jet
and next-to-next-to-leading order 3-jet production at hadronic colliders. Very
compact expressions for all possible helicity configurations are provided,
allowing for direct implementation in Monte-Carlo codes.
