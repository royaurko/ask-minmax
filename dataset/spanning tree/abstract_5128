Braneworld inflation on the resolved warped deformed conifold is represented
by the dynamics of a D3-brane probe with the world volume of a brane spanning
the large dimensions of the observable Universe. This model was recently
proposed as a string theory candidate for slow-roll inflationary cosmology in
hep-th/0511254. During inflation, the scalar curvature of the Universe is
determined by the Hubble scale. We argue that taking into account the curvature
of the inflationary Universe renders dynamics of the D3-brane fast-roll deep
inside the warped throat.
