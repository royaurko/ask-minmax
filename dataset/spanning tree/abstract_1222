We propose a dynamic programming algorithm for projection onto wavelet tree
structures. In contrast to other recently proposed algorithms which only give
approximate tree projections for a given sparsity, our algorithm is guaranteed
to calculate the projection exactly. We also prove that our algorithm has O(Nk)
complexity, where N is the signal dimension and k is the sparsity of the tree
approximation.
