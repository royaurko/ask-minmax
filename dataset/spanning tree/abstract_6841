We prove that an arbitrary right-angled Artin group $G$ admits a
quasi-isometric group embedding into a right-angled Artin group defined by the
opposite graph of a tree. Consequently, $G$ admits quasi-isometric group
embeddings into a pure braid group and into the area-preserving diffeomorphism
groups of the 2--disk and the 2--sphere, answering questions due to
Crisp--Wiest and M. Kapovich. Another corollary is that a pure braid group
contains a closed hyperbolic manifold group as a quasi-isometrically embedded
subgroup up to dimension eight. Finally, we show that the isomorphism problem,
conjugacy problem, and membership problems are unsolvable in the class of
finitely presented subgroups of braid groups.
