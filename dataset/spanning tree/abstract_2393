We show that there exist linear-time algorithms that compute the strong
chromatic index and a maximum induced matching of tree-cographs when the
decomposition tree is a part of the input. We also show that there exist
efficient algorithms for the strong chromatic index of (bipartite) permutation
graphs and of chordal bipartite graphs.
