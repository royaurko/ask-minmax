It was proposed by Ryu and Takayanagi that the entanglement entropy in
conformal field theory (CFT) is related through the AdS/CFT correspondence to
the area of a minimal surface in the bulk. We apply this holographic
geometrical method of calculating the entanglement entropy to study the vacuum
case of a CFT which is holographically dual to empty anti-de Sitter (AdS)
spacetime. We present all possible minimal surfaces spanned on one or two
spherical boundaries at AdS infinity. We give exact analytical expressions for
the regularized areas of these surfaces and identify finite renormalized
quantities. In the case of two disjoint boundaries the existence of two
different phases of the entanglement entropy is confirmed. A trivial phase
corresponds to two disconnected minimal surfaces, while the other one
corresponds to a tube connecting the spherical boundaries. A transition between
these phases is reminiscent of the finite temperature deconfinement transition
in the CFT on the boundary. The exact analytical results are thus consistent
with previous numerical and approximate computations. We also briefly discuss
the character of a spacetime extension of the minimal surface spanned on two
uniformly accelerated boundaries.
