Liquids in contact with solids are submitted to intermolecular forces
inferring density gradients at the walls. The van der Waals forces make liquid
heterogeneous, the stress tensor is not any more spherical as in homogeneous
bulks and it is possible to obtain stable thin liquid films wetting vertical
walls up to altitudes that incompressible fluid models are not forecasting.
Application to micro tubes of xylem enables to understand why the ascent of sap
is possible for very high trees like sequoias or giant eucalyptus.
