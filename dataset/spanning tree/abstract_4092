The average node-to-node distance of scale-free graphs depends
logarithmically on N, the number of nodes, while the probability distribution
function (pdf) of the distances may take various forms. Here we analyze these
by considering mean-field arguments and by mapping the m=1 case of the
Barabasi-Albert model into a tree with a depth-dependent branching ratio. This
shows the origins of the average distance scaling and allows a demonstration of
why the distribution approaches a Gaussian in the limit of N large. The load
(betweenness), the number of shortest distance paths passing through any node,
is discussed in the tree presentation.
