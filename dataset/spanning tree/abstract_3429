The pion-nucleon sigma term is shown to be equal to the Goldberger-Treiman
discrepancy at tree level. Its value estimated this way is very sensitive to
the pion-nucleon coupling constant g_{pi NN}. This relation, when combined with
the pion-nucleon S-wave scattering lengths, yields a new determination of g_{pi
NN} at tree level. The results of a one-loop analysis are also summarized
determining an allowed range for the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant
g_P.
