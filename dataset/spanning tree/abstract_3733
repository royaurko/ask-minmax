Interaction Grammar (IG) is a grammatical formalism based on the notion of
polarity. Polarities express the resource sensitivity of natural languages by
modelling the distinction between saturated and unsaturated syntactic
structures. Syntactic composition is represented as a chemical reaction guided
by the saturation of polarities. It is expressed in a model-theoretic framework
where grammars are constraint systems using the notion of tree description and
parsing appears as a process of building tree description models satisfying
criteria of saturation and minimality.
