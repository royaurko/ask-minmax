The Allan variance (AVAR) is one option among the wavelet variances. However
a milestone in the analysis of frequency fluctuations and in the long-term
stability of clocks, and certainly the most widely used one, AVAR is not
suitable when fast noise processes show up, chiefly because of the poor
rejection of white phase noise. The modified Allan variance (MVAR) features
high resolution in the presence of white PM noise, but it is poorer for slow
phenomena because the wavelet spans over 50% longer time.
  This article introduces the Parabolic Variance (PVAR), a wavelet variance
similar to the Allan variance, based on the Linear Regression (LR) of phase
data. The PVAR relates to the Omega frequency counter, which is the topics of a
companion article [the reference to the article, or to the ArXiv manuscript,
will be provided later]. The PVAR wavelet spans over 2 tau, the same of the
AVAR wavelet.
  After setting the theoretical framework, we analyze the degrees of freedom
and the detection of weak noise processes in a realistic case, where (at least)
two types of noise are present simultaneously. This is for example the case of
the detection of white FM noise of an atomic standard in the presence of the
white PM noise of the instrument.
  Comparing the three wavelet variances, PVAR features almost as well as AVAR
in the detection of slow phenomena, like random walk and drift. By contrast,
PVAR exhibits the best ability to divide between fast noise phenomena, from
white PM to flicker FM, and it is in all cases superior to MVAR.
