We present preliminary results on the parallelization of a Tree-Code for
evaluating gravitational forces in N-body astrophysical systems. Our HPF/CRAFT
implementation on a CRAY T3E machine attained an encouraging speed-up behavior,
reaching a value of 75 with 128 processor elements (PEs). The speed-up tests
regard the evaluation of the forces among N = 130,369 particles distributed
scaling the actual distribution of a sample of galaxies of the Leda catalog.
