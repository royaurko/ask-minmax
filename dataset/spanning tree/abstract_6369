A necessary and sufficient condition for the almost sure existence of an
absolutely continuous (with respect to the branching measure) exact Hausdorff
measure on the boundary of a Galton--Watson tree is obtained. In the case where
the absolutely continuous exact Hausdorff measure does not exist almost surely,
a criterion which classifies gauge functions $\phi$ according to whether
$\phi$-Hausdorff measure of the boundary minus a certain exceptional set is
zero or infinity is given. Important examples are discussed in four additional
theorems. In particular, Hawkes's conjecture in 1981 is solved. Problems of
determining the exact local dimension of the branching measure at a typical
point of the boundary are also solved.
