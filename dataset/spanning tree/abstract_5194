The nucleon elastic form factors are of fundamental interest, provide a
unique testing ground for QCD motivated models of nucleon structure and are of
critical importance to our understanding of the electromagnetic properties of
nuclei. Even after an experimental effort spanning nearly 50 years the nucleon
form factors are still the subject of active investigation. Advances in
polarized beams, polarized targets and recoil polarimetry have been exploited
over the last decade to produce an important and precise set of data. I review
the status of the experimental efforts to measure the nucleon elastic form
factors.
