The Rayleigh monotonicity is a principle from the theory of electrical
networks. Its combinatorial interpretation says for each two edges of a graph
G, that the presence of one of them in a random spanning tree of G is
negatively correlated with the presence of the other edge. In this paper we
give a self-contained (inductive) proof of Rayleigh monotonicity for graphs.
