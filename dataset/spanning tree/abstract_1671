The precise formulation of derivation for tree-adjoining grammars has
important ramifications for a wide variety of uses of the formalism, from
syntactic analysis to semantic interpretation and statistical language
modeling. We argue that the definition of tree-adjoining derivation must be
reformulated in order to manifest the proper linguistic dependencies in
derivations. The particular proposal is both precisely characterizable through
a definition of TAG derivations as equivalence classes of ordered derivation
trees, and computationally operational, by virtue of a compilation to linear
indexed grammars together with an efficient algorithm for recognition and
parsing according to the compiled grammar.
