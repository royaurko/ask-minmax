Identities based on monodromy for integrations in string theory are used to
derive relations between different color ordered tree-level amplitudes in both
bosonic and supersymmetric string theory. These relations imply that the color
ordered tree-level n-point gauge theory amplitudes can be expanded in a minimal
basis of (n-3)! amplitudes. This result holds for any choice of polarizations
of the external states and in any number of dimensions.
