Consider a vertex-reinforced jump process defined on a regular tree, where
each vertex has exactly $b$ children, with $b \ge 3$. We prove the strong law
of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the distance of the process
from the root. Notice that it is still unknown if vertex-reinforced jump
process is transient on the binary tree.
