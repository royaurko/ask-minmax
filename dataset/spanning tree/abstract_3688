A wide range of applications and research has been done with genome-scale
metabolic models. In this work we describe a methodology for comparing
metabolic networks constructed from genome-scale metabolic models and how to
apply this comparison in order to infer evolutionary distances between
different organisms. Our methodology allows a quantification of the metabolic
differences between different species from a broad range of families and even
kingdoms. This quantification is then applied in order to reconstruct
phylogenetic trees for sets of various organisms.
