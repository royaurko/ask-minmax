Using a new proposal for the "picture lowering" operators, we compute the
tree level scattering amplitude in the minimal pure spinor formalism by
performing the integration over the pure spinor space as a multidimensional
Cauchy-type integral. The amplitude will be written in terms of the projective
pure spinor variables, which turns out to be useful to relate rigorously the
minimal and non-minimal versions of the pure spinor formalism. The natural
language for relating these formalisms is the Cech-Dolbeault isomorphism.
Moreover, the Dolbeault cocycle corresponding to the tree-level scattering
amplitude must be evaluated in SO(10)/SU(5) instead of the whole pure spinor
space, which means that the origin is removed from this space. Also, the
Cech-Dolbeault language plays a key role for proving the invariance of the
scattering amplitude under BRST, Lorentz and supersymmetry transformations, as
well as the decoupling of unphysical states. We also relate the Green's
function for the massless scalar field in ten dimensions to the tree-level
scattering amplitude and comment about the scattering amplitude at higher
orders. In contrast with the traditional picture lowering operators, with our
new proposal the tree level scattering amplitude is independent of the constant
spinors introduced to define them and the BRST exact terms decouple without
integrating over these constant spinors.
