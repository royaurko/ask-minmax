In this note we further investigate the procedure for computing tree-level
amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory from connected instantons in the B-model on
P^{3|4}, emphasizing that the problem of calculating Feynman diagrams is recast
into the problem of finding solutions to a certain set of algebraic equations.
We show that the B-model correctly reproduces all 6-particle amplitudes,
including non-MHV amplitudes with three negative and three positive helicity
gluons. As a further check, we also show that n-particle amplitudes obtained
from the B-model obey a number of properties required of gauge theory, such as
parity symmetry (which relates an integral over degree d curves to one over
degree n-d-2 curves) and the soft and collinear gluon poles.
