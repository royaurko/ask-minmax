We study the exact rolling tachyon solutions in DBI type noncommutative field
theory with a constant open string metric and noncommutative parameter on an
unstable D$p$-brane. Functional shapes of the obtained solutions span all
possible homogeneous rolling tachyon configurations; that is, they are
hyperbolic-cosine, hyperbolic-sine, and exponential under $1/\cosh$ runaway NC
tachyon potential. Even if general DBI type NC electric field is turned on,
only a constant electric field satisfies the equations of motion, and again,
exact rolling tachyon solutions are obtained.
