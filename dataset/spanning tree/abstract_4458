False-positives are a problem in anomaly-based intrusion detection systems.
To counter this issue, we discuss anomaly detection for the eXtensible Markup
Language (XML) in a language-theoretic view. We argue that many XML-based
attacks target the syntactic level, i.e. the tree structure or element content,
and syntax validation of XML documents reduces the attack surface. XML offers
so-called schemas for validation, but in real world, schemas are often
unavailable, ignored or too general. In this work-in-progress paper we describe
a grammatical inference approach to learn an automaton from example XML
documents for detecting documents with anomalous syntax.
  We discuss properties and expressiveness of XML to understand limits of
learnability. Our contributions are an XML Schema compatible lexical datatype
system to abstract content in XML and an algorithm to learn visibly pushdown
automata (VPA) directly from a set of examples. The proposed algorithm does not
require the tree representation of XML, so it can process large documents or
streams. The resulting deterministic VPA then allows stream validation of
documents to recognize deviations in the underlying tree structure or
datatypes.
