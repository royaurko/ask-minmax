The structure of anticyclic operad on the Dendriform operad defines in
particular a matrix of finite order acting on the vector space spanned by
planar binary trees. We compute its characteristic polynomial and propose a
(compatible) conjecture for the characteristic polynomial of the Coxeter
transformation for the Tamari lattice, which is mostly a square root of this
matrix.
