An attempt to come closer to a resolution of the Collatz conjecture is
presented. The central idea is the formation of a tree consisting of positive
odd numbers with number 1 as root. Functions for generating the tree from the
root are presented and paths from nodes to the root are given by modified
Collatz sequences (with the even numbers omitted). The Collatz problem is thus
reduced to showing that all positive odd numbers are present in the tree. The
main result is the proof of the boundedness of Collatz sequences. With the even
numbers omitted they either end up in the number 1 (convergence) or in a
repetitive cycle of numbers (divergence). The existence/non-existence of cycles
in Collatz sequences (with the even numbers omitted) is still an open question.
