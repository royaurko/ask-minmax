The aim of this paper is an algebraic study of the Hopf algebra H_R of rooted
trees, which was introduced in \cite{Kreimer1,Connes,Broadhurst,Kreimer2}. We
first construct comodules over H_R from finite families of primitive elements.
Furthermore, we classify these comodules by restricting the possible families
of primitive elements, and taking the quotient by the action of certain groups.
  In the next section, we give a formula about primitive elements of the
subalgebra of ladders, and construct a projection operator on the space of
primitive elements. It allows us to obtain a basis of the primitive elements by
an inductive process, which answers one of the questions of \cite{Kreimer}.
  In the last sections, we classify the Hopf algebra endomorphisms and the
coalgebras endomorphisms, using the graded Hopf algebra gr(H_R) associated to
the filtration by deg_p of \cite{Kreimer}. We then prove that H_R is isomorphic
to gr(H_R), and deduce a decomposition of the group of the Hopf algebra
automorphisms of H_R as a semi-direct product.
