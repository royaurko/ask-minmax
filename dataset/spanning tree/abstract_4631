As cell proliferation is limited due to the loss of telomere repeats in DNA
of normal somatic cells during division, telomere attrition can possibly play
an important role in determining the maximum life span of organisms as well as
contribute to the process of biological ageing. With computer simulations of
cell culture development in organisms, which consist of tissues of normal
somatic cells with finite growth, we otain an increase of life span and life
expectancy for longer telomeric DNA in the zygote. By additionally considering
a two-mutation model for carcinogenesis and indefinite proliferation by the
activation of telomerase, we demonstrate that the risk of dying due to cancer
can outweigh the positive effect of longer telomeres on the longevity.
