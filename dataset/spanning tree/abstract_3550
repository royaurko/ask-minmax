We extend a classical construction on symmetric functions, the superization
process, to several combinatorial Hopf algebras, and obtain analogs of the
hook-content formula for the (q,t)-specializations of various bases. Exploiting
the dendriform structures yields in particular (q,t)-analogs of the
Bjorner-Wachs q-hook-length formulas for binary trees, and similar formulas for
plane trees.
