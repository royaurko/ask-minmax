We prove the exact asymptotic $1-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ for the
probability that the underlying graph of a random mapping of $n$ elements
possesses a unique highest tree. The property of having a unique highest tree
turned out to be crucial in the solution of the famous Road Coloring Problem as
well as in the proof of the contributor's result about the probability of being
synchronizable for a random automaton. Furthermore, some of auxiliary
statements that we present here can be useful for proving results appealing to
the theory of critical Galton-Watson branching processes.
