Phylogenetic networks generalize evolutionary trees, and are commonly used to
represent evolutionary histories of species that undergo reticulate
evolutionary processes such as hybridization, recombination and lateral gene
transfer. Recently, there has been great interest in trying to develop methods
to construct rooted phylogenetic networks from triplets, that is rooted trees
on three species. However, although triplets determine or encode rooted
phylogenetic trees, they do not in general encode rooted phylogenetic networks,
which is a potential issue for any such method. Motivated by this fact, Huber
and Moulton recently introduced trinets as a natural extension of rooted
triplets to networks. In particular, they showed that level-1 phylogenetic
networks are encoded by their trinets, and also conjectured that all
"recoverable" rooted phylogenetic networks are encoded by their trinets. Here
we prove that recoverable binary level-2 networks and binary tree-child
networks are also encoded by their trinets. To do this we prove two
decomposition theorems based on trinets which hold for all recoverable binary
rooted phylogenetic networks. Our results provide some additional evidence in
support of the conjecture that trinets encode all recoverable rooted
phylogenetic networks, and could also lead to new approaches to construct
phylogenetic networks from trinets.
