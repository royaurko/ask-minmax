We propose a scheme enabling the universal coupling of angular momentum of
$N$ remote noninteracting qubits using linear optical tools only. Our system
consists of $N$ single-photon emitters in a $\Lambda$-configuration that are
entangled among their long-lived ground-state qubits through suitably designed
measurements of the emitted photons. In this manner, we present an
experimentally feasible algorithm that is able to generate any of the $2^N$
symmetric and nonsymmetric total angular momentum eigenstates spanning the
Hilbert space of the $N$-qubit compound.
