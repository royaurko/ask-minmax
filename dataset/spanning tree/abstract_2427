In this paper we study Ramsey numbers for trees of diameter 3 (bistars) vs.,
respectively, trees of diameter 2 (stars), complete graphs, and many complete
graphs. In the case of bistars vs. many complete graphs, we determine this
number exactly as a function of the Ramsey number for the complete graphs. We
also determine the order of growth of the bipartite $k$-color Ramsey number for
a bistar.
