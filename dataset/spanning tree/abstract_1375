In this paper we prove that the existence of absolutely continuous spectrum
of the Kirchhoff Laplacian on a radial metric tree graph together with a finite
complexity of the geometry of the tree implies that the tree is in fact
eventually periodic. This complements the results by Breuer and Frank in
\cite{BreuerFrank2009} in the discrete case as well as for sparse trees in the
metric case.
