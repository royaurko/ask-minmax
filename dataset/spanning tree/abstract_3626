We study the height and width of a Galton--Watson tree with offspring
distribution B satisfying E(B)=1, 0 < Var(B) < infinity, conditioned on having
exactly n nodes. Under this conditioning, we derive sub-Gaussian tail bounds
for both the width (largest number of nodes in any level) and height (greatest
level containing a node); the bounds are optimal up to constant factors in the
exponent. Under the same conditioning, we also derive essentially optimal upper
tail bounds for the number of nodes at level k, for 1 <= k <= n.
