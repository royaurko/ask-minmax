We discuss families of triples of graphs whose Hosoya indices are primitive
Pythagorean triples. Hosoya gave a method to construct such families of
caterpillars, i.e., trees whose vertices are within distance 1 of a central
path. He also pointed out a common structure to the families, and conjectured
the uniqueness of the structure. In this paper, we give an answer to his
conjecture.
