In the framework of the effective field theory (EFT) we discuss the
electroweak (EW) corrections at LEP energies. We obtain the effective
Lagrangian in the large m_t limit, and reproduce analytically the dominant EW
corrections to the LEP2 processes e+ e- --> gamma Z and e+ e- --> Z Z. To
include effects of finite top-quark and Higgs masses, we use the effective
Lagrangian at tree level and fit LEP1/SLD observables with four arbitrary
parameters, plus alpha_s(m_Z). The EFT approach works remarkably well. Using
the effective couplings determined from the fit, and tree-level EFT formulae,
we predict the cross sections for e+ e- --> Z Z, gamma Z at a level better than
1%.
