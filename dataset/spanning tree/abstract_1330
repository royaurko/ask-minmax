When genetic algorithms are used to evolve decision trees, key tree quality
parameters can be recursively computed and re-used across generations of
partially similar decision trees. Simply storing instance indices at leaves is
enough for fitness to be piecewise computed in a lossless fashion. We show the
derivation of the (substantial) expected speed-up on two bounding case problems
and trace the attractive property of lossless fitness inheritance to the
divide-and-conquer nature of decision trees. The theoretical results are
supported by experimental evidence.
