In any tree, crude sap is driven through xylem microtubes. The crude sap is
submitted to intermolecular forces shaping it into very thin liquid films in
embolized xylem microtubes. The concept of disjoining pressure must be taken
into account and a strong negative pressure can be present in liquid-water
bulks. The disjoining pressure gradient induced by the flux of transpiration
initiates crude sap motion. Applications enable to understand why the xylem
microtubes can be refilled and why the ascent of sap is possible even for the
tallest trees avoiding the problems due to cavitation.
