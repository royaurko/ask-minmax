We consider Schroedinger operators on regular metric trees and prove
Lieb-Thirring and Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum inequalities for their negative
eigenvalues. The validity of these inequalities depends on the volume growth of
the tree. We show that the bounds are valid in the endpoint case and reflect
the correct order in the weak or strong coupling limit.
