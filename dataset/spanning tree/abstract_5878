The hitting time, h_uv, of a random walk on a finite graph G, is the expected
time for the walk to reach vertex v given that it started at vertex u. We
present two methods of calculating the hitting time between vertices of finite
graphs, along with applications to specific classes of graphs, including grids,
trees, and the 'tadpole' graphs.
