The BRAHMS collaboration ended its data collection program in 2006. We are
now well advanced in the analysis of a comprehensive set of data that spans
systems ranging in mass from p+p to Au+Au and in energy from $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =
62.4$ to 200 GeV. Our analysis has taken two distinct paths: we explore the
rapidity dependence of intermediate and high-transverse-momentum,
identified-particle production, thus helping to characterize the
strongly-interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) formed at RHIC; we also explore
particle yields at lower transverse momentum to develop a systematic
understanding of bulk particle production at RHIC energies.
