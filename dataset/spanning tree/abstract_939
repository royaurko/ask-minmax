We investigate characteristics of random split trees introduced by Devroye;
split trees include for example binary search trees, $m$-ary search trees,
quadtrees, median of $(2k+1)$-trees, simplex trees, tries and digital search
trees. More precisely: We introduce the use of renewal theory in the studies of
split trees, and use this theory to prove several results about split trees. A
split tree of cardinality $n$ is constructed by distributing $n$ "balls" (which
often represent "key numbers") in a subset of vertices of an infinite tree. One
of our main results is to give a relation between the deterministic number of
balls $n$ and the random number of vertices $N$. Devroye has found a central
limit law for the depth of the last inserted ball so that most vertices are
close to $\frac{\ln n}{\mu}+\mathcal{O}\Big(\sqrt{\ln n}\Big)$, where $\mu$ is
some constant depending on the type of split tree; we sharpen this result by
finding an upper bound for the expected number of vertices with depths
$\geq\frac{\ln n}{\mu}+\ln^{0.5+\epsilon} n$ or depths $\leq\frac{\ln
n}{\mu}+\ln^{0.5+\epsilon} n$ for any choice of $\epsilon>0$. We also find the
first asymptotic of the variances of the depths of the balls in the tree.
