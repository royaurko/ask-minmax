Spectral broadening in silicon is studied numerically as well as
experimentally. Temporal dynamics of the free carriers generated during the
propagation of optical pulses, through the process of two-photon absorption
(TPA), affect the amplitude and phase of the optical pulses, thereby
determining the nature and extent of the generated spectral continuum.
Experimental results are obtained by propagating pico-second optical pulses in
a silicon waveguide for intensities that span two orders of magnitude (1-150
GW/cm2). These results validate the conclusions drawn from numerical
simulations that the continuum generation has a self-limiting nature in
silicon.
