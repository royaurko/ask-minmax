It is well known that a simple, supercritical Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson
process turns into a subcritical such process, if conditioned to die out. We
prove that the corresponding holds true for general, multi-type branching,
where child-bearing may occur at different ages, life span may depend upon
reproduction, and the whole course of events is thus affected by conditioning
upon extinction.
