The Davis--Kahan theorem is used in the analysis of many statistical
procedures to bound the distance between subspaces spanned by population
eigenvectors and their sample versions. It relies on an eigenvalue separation
condition between certain relevant population and sample eigenvalues. We
present a variant of this result that depends only on a population eigenvalue
separation condition, making it more natural and convenient for direct
application in statistical contexts, and improving the bounds in some cases. We
also provide an extension to situations where the matrices under study may be
asymmetric or even non-square, and where interest is in the distance between
subspaces spanned by corresponding singular vectors.
