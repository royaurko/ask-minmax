Vince and Wang showed that the average subtree density of a series-reduced
tree is between 1/2 and 3/4, answering a conjecture of Jamison. They ask under
what conditions a sequence of such trees may have average subtree density
tending to either bound; we answer these questions by giving simple necessary
and sufficient conditions in each case.
