Both IP lookup and packet classification in IP routers can be implemented by
some form of tree traversal. SRAM-based Pipelining can improve the throughput
dramatically. However, previous pipelining schemes result in unbalanced memory
allocation over the pipeline stages. This has been identified as a major
challenge for scalable pipelined solutions. This paper proposes a flexible
bidirectional linear pipeline architecture based on widely-used dual-port
SRAMs. A search tree is partitioned, and then mapped onto pipeline stages by a
bidirectional fine-grained mapping scheme. We introduce the notion of inversion
factor and several heuristics to invert subtrees for memory balancing. Due to
its linear structure, the architecture maintains packet input order, and
supports non-blocking route updates. Our experiments show that, the
architecture can achieve a perfectly balanced memory distribution over the
pipeline stages, for both trie-based IP lookup and tree-based multi-dimensional
packet classification. For IP lookup, it can store a full backbone routing
table with 154419 entries using 2MB of memory, and sustain a high throughput of
1.87 billion packets per second (GPPS), i.e. 0.6 Tbps for the minimum size (40
bytes) packets. The throughput can be improved further to be 2.4 Tbps, by
employing caching to exploit the Internet traffic locality.
