We introduce the notion of the $k$-closure of a group of automorphisms of a
locally finite tree, and give several examples of the construction. We show
that the $k$-closure satisfies a new property of automorphism groups of trees
that generalises Tits' Property $P$. We prove that, apart from some degenerate
cases, any non-discrete group acting on a tree with this property contains an
abstractly simple subgroup.
