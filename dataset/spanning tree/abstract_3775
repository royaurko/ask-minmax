We compute the dimension 6 effective Lagrangian arising from the tree level
integration of an arbitrary number of bulk fermions in models with warped extra
dimensions. The coefficients of the effective operators are written in terms of
simple integrals of the metric and are valid for arbitrary warp factors, with
or without an infrared brane, and for a general Higgs profile. All relevant
tree level fermion effects in electroweak and flavor observables can be
computed using this effective Lagrangian.
