For sp(n+2) and each exceptional Lie algebra a realization of depth 2
preserving the spaces spanned by a contact one-form and a bilinear form is
given. For e_7 and e_6 a realization of depth 1 preserving a lightcone and the
space spanned by a bilinear form is also presented. This makes the origin of
the exceptions clear.
