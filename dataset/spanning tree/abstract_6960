Deep LSTM is an ideal candidate for text recognition. However text
recognition involves some initial image processing steps like segmentation of
lines and words which can induce error to the recognition system. Without
segmentation, learning very long range context is difficult and becomes
computationally intractable. Therefore, alternative soft decisions are needed
at the pre-processing level. This paper proposes a hybrid text recognizer using
a deep recurrent neural network with multiple layers of abstraction and long
range context along with a language model to verify the performance of the deep
neural network. In this paper we construct a multi-hypotheses tree architecture
with candidate segments of line sequences from different segmentation
algorithms at its different branches. The deep neural network is trained on
perfectly segmented data and tests each of the candidate segments, generating
unicode sequences. In the verification step, these unicode sequences are
validated using a sub-string match with the language model and best first
search is used to find the best possible combination of alternative hypothesis
from the tree structure. Thus the verification framework using language models
eliminates wrong segmentation outputs and filters recognition errors.
