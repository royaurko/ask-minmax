We consider smoothness properties of the generator of a principal Gabor space
on the real line which is invariant under some additional
translation-modulation pair. We prove that if a Gabor system on a lattice with
rational density is a Riesz basis for its closed linear span, and if the closed
linear span, a Gabor space, has any additional translation-modulation
invariance, then its generator cannot decay well in time and in frequency
simultaneously.
