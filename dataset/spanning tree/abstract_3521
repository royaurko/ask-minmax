In this paper we develop a bubble tree structure for a degenerating class of
Riemannian metrics satisfying some global conformal bounds on compact manifolds
of dimension 4. Applying the bubble tree structure, we establish a gap theorem,
a finiteness theorem for diffeomorphism type for this class, and a diameter
bound for a family of conformal metricssatisfying a suitable curvature
equation.
