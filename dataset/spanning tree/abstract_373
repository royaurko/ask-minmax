The Steiner ratio characterizes the greatest possible deviation of the length
of a minimal spanning tree from the length of the minimal Steiner tree. In this
paper, estimates of the Steiner ratio on Riemannian manifolds are obtained. As
a corollary, the Steiner ratio for flat tori, flat Klein bottles, and
projective plane of constant positive curvature are computed. Steiner ratio -
