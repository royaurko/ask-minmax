A multi-labeled tree, or MUL-tree, is a phylogenetic tree where two or more
leaves share a label, e.g., a species name. A MUL-tree can imply multiple
conflicting phylogenetic relationships for the same set of taxa, but can also
contain conflict-free information that is of interest and yet is not obvious.
We define the information content of a MUL-tree T as the set of all
conflict-free quartet topologies implied by T, and define the maximal reduced
form of T as the smallest tree that can be obtained from T by pruning leaves
and contracting edges while retaining the same information content. We show
that any two MUL-trees with the same information content exhibit the same
reduced form. This introduces an equivalence relation in MUL-trees with
potential applications to comparing MUL-trees. We present an efficient
algorithm to reduce a MUL-tree to its maximally reduced form and evaluate its
performance on empirical datasets in terms of both quality of the reduced tree
and the degree of data reduction achieved.
