Analysis of probability distributions conditional on species trees has
demonstrated the existence of anomalous ranked gene trees (ARGTs), ranked gene
trees that are more probable than the ranked gene tree that accords with the
ranked species tree. Here, to improve the characterization of ARGTs, we study
enumerative and probabilistic properties of two classes of ranked labeled
species trees, focusing on the presence or avoidance of certain subtree
patterns associated with the production of ARGTs. We provide exact enumerations
and asymptotic estimates for cardinalities of these sets of trees, showing that
as the number of species increases without bound, the fraction of all ranked
labeled species trees that are ARGT-producing approaches 1. This result extends
beyond earlier existence results to provide a probabilistic claim about the
frequency of ARGTs.
