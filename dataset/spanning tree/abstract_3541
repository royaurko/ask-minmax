RNA viruses provide prominent examples of measurably evolving populations. In
HIV infection, the development of drug resistance is of particular interest,
because precise predictions of the outcome of this evolutionary process are a
prerequisite for the rational design of antiretroviral treatment protocols. We
present a mutagenetic tree hidden Markov model for the analysis of longitudinal
clonal sequence data. Using HIV mutation data from clinical trials, we estimate
the order and rate of occurrence of seven amino acid changes that are
associated with resistance to the reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz.
