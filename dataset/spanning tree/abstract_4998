Project GRAND measures the asymmetries of secondary cosmic muons by
calculating the differences between the muons from the east and the muons from
the west for complete solar days. A similar north-south difference is also
presented. These muons are identified in single track data taken with the 64
stations of Project GRAND; the data cover a two year span with a total muon
sample of 30 billion muons.
