Let $\mathcal {T}^{\Delta}_n$ denote the set of trees of order $n$, in which
the degree of each vertex is bounded by some integer $\Delta$. Suppose that
every tree in $\mathcal {T}^{\Delta}_n$ is equally likely. For any given
subtree $H$, we show that the number of occurrences of $H$ in trees of
$\mathcal {T}^{\Delta}_n$ is with mean $(\mu_H+o(1))n$ and variance
$(\sigma_H+o(1))n$, where $\mu_H$, $\sigma_H$ are some constants. As an
application, we estimate the value of the Estrada index $EE$ for almost all
trees in $\mathcal {T}^{\Delta}_n$, and give an explanation in theory to the
approximate linear correlation between $EE$ and the first Zagreb index obtained
by quantitative analysis.
