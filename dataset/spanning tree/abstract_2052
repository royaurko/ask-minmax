This is a continuation of the study, begun by Ceccherini-Silberstein and
Woess, of context-free pairs of groups and the related context-free graphs in
the sense of Muller and Schupp. Instead of the cones (connected components with
respect to deletion of finite balls with respect to the graph metric), a more
general approach to context-free graphs is proposed via tree sets consisting of
cuts of the graph, and associated structure trees. The existence of tree sets
with certain "good" properties is studied. With a tree set, a natural
context-free grammar is associated. These investigations of the structure of
context free pairs, resp. graphs are then applied to study random walk
asymptotics via complex analysis.
