We give an algebraic characterization of the tree languages that are defined
by logical formulas using certain Lindstr\"om quantifiers. An important
instance of our result concerns first-order definable tree languages. Our
characterization relies on the usage of preclones, an algebraic structure
introduced by the contributors in a previous paper, and of the block product
operation on preclones. Our results generalize analogous results on finite word
languages, but it must be noted that, as they stand, they do not yield an
algorithm to decide whether a given regular tree language is first-order
definable.
