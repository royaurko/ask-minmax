We study the properties of random walks on complex trees. We observe that the
absence of loops reflects in physical observables showing large differences
with respect to their looped counterparts. First, both the vertex discovery
rate and the mean topological displacement from the origin present a
considerable slowing down in the tree case. Second, the mean first passage time
(MFPT) displays a logarithmic degree dependence, in contrast to the inverse
degree shape exhibited in looped networks. This deviation can be ascribed to
the dominance of source-target topological distance in trees. To show this, we
study the distance dependence of a symmetrized MFPT and derive its logarithmic
profile, obtaining good agreement with simulation results. These unique
properties shed light on the recently reported anomalies observed in diffusive
dynamical systems on trees.
