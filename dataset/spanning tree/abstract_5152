In this article, we give a theorem of reduction of the structure group of a
principal bundle P with regular structure group G. Then, when G is in the
classes of Lie groups defined by T.Robart [13], we define the closed holonomy
group of a connection as the minimal closed Lie subgroup of G for which the
previous theorem of reduction can be applied. We also prove an infinite
dimensional version of the Ambrose-Singer theorem: the Lie algebra of the
holonomy group is spanned by the curvature elements.
