In this article we announce some results on compactifying moduli spaces of
rank-2 vector bundles on surfaces by spaces of vector bundles on trees of
surfaces. This is thought as an algebraic counterpart of the so called bubbling
of vector bundles and connections in differential geometry. The new moduli
spaces are algebraic spaces arising as quotients by group actions according to
a result of Koll\'ar. As an example the compactification of the space of stable
rank-2 vector bundles with Chern classes $c_1=0, c_1=2$ on the projective plane
is studied in more detail. Proofs are only indicated and will appear in
separate papers.
