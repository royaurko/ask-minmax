Bestvina and Feighn showed that a morphism S --> T between two simplicial
trees that commutes with the action of a group G can be written as a product
of elementary folding operations. Here a more general morphism between
simplicial trees is considered, which allow different groups to act on S and
T. It is shown that these morphisms can again be written as a product of
elementary operations: the Bestvina-Feighn folds plus the so-called `vertex
morphisms'. Applications of this theory are presented. Limits of infinite
folding sequences are considered. One application is that a finitely generated
inaccessible group must contain an infinite torsion subgroup.
