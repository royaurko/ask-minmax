In an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (popularly known
as the $\mu\nu$SSM), three right handed neutrino superfields are introduced to
solve the $\mu$-problem and to accommodate the non-vanishing neutrino masses
and mixing. Neutrino masses at the tree level are generated through $R-$parity
violation and seesaw mechanism. We have analyzed the full effect of one-loop
contributions to the neutrino mass matrix. We show that the current three
flavour global neutrino data can be accommodated in the $\mu\nu$SSM, for both
the tree level and one-loop corrected analyses. We find that it is relatively
easier to accommodate the normal hierarchical mass pattern compared to the
inverted hierarchical or quasi-degenerate case, when one-loop corrections are
included.
