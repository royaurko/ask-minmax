We summarize our work on structures in different stages of aggregation, and
spanning a wide range in redshift. We emphasize our work on high resdhift
clusters. This comprises the analysis of ~7 square degrees using deep images
with several broad-band optical filters. We plan to complement these with near
IR observations in 4 m telescopes. Preliminary results of the analysis in a
field of 35 x 35 arcmin^2 indicate the detection of several candidates to be
clusters at redshifst z> 0.5. When all the fields are analyzed, we will have an
adequate sample for future detailed studies with the GTC.
