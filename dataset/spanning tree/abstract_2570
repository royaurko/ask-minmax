In this paper, new families of quadriphase sequences with larger linear span
and size have been proposed and studied. In particular, a new family of
quadriphase sequences of period $2^n-1$ for a positive integer $n=em$ with an
even positive factor $m$ is presented, the cross-correlation function among
these sequences has been explicitly calculated. Another new family of
quadriphase sequences of period $2(2^n-1)$ for a positive integer $n=em$ with
an even positive factor $m$ is also presented, a detailed analysis of the
cross-correlation function of proposed sequences has also been presented.
