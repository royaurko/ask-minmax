We have recently developed an extended merger-tree model that efficiently
follows hierarchical evolution of galaxy clusters and provides a quantitative
description of both their dark matter and gas properties. We employed this
diagnostic tool to calculate the thermal SZ power spectrum and cluster number
counts, accounting explicitly for uncertainties in the relevant statistical and
intrinsic cluster properties, such as the halo mass function and the gas
equation of state. Results of these calculations are compared with those
obtained from a direct analytic treatment and from hydrodynamical simulations.
We show that under certain assumptions on the gas mass fraction our results are
consistent with the latest SPT measurement. Our approach can be particularly
useful in predicting cluster number counts and their dependence on cluster and
cosmological parameters.
