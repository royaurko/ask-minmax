Multicast is the ability of a communication network to accept a single
message from an application and to deliver copies of the message to multiple
recipients at different location. With the development of Internet, Multicast
is widely applied in all kinds of multimedia real-time application: distributed
multimedia systems, collaborative computing, video-conferencing, distance
education, etc. In order to construct a delay-constrained multicast routing
tree, average distance heuristic (ADH) algorithm is analyzed firstly. Then a
delay-constrained algorithm called DCADH (delay-constrained average distance
heuristic) is presented. By using ADH a least cost multicast routing tree can
be constructed; if the path delay can't meet the delay upper bound, a shortest
delay path which is computed by Dijkstra algorithm will be merged into the
existing multicast routing tree to meet the delay upper bound. Simulation
experiments show that DCADH has a good performance in achieving a low-cost
multicast routing tree.
