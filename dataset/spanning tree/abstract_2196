This paper presents a multidimensional Dependency Grammar (DG), which
decouples the dependency tree from word order, such that surface ordering is
not determined by traversing the dependency tree. We develop the notion of a
\emph{word order domain structure}, which is linked but structurally dissimilar
to the syntactic dependency tree. We then discuss the implementation of such a
DG using constructs from a unification-based phrase-structure approach, namely
Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG). Particular attention is given to the analysis
of discontinuities in DG in terms of LFG's functional uncertainty.
