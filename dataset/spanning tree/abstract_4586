Starting from a full renormalised trajectory for the effective average action
(a.k.a. infrared cutoff Legendre effective action) $\Gamma_k$, we explicitly
reconstruct corresponding bare actions, formulated in one of two ways. The
first step is to construct the corresponding Wilsonian effective action $S^k$
through a tree-level expansion in terms of the vertices provided by $\Gamma_k$.
It forms a perfect bare action giving the same renormalised trajectory. A bare
action with some ultraviolet cutoff scale $\Lambda$ and infrared cutoff $k$
necessarily produces an effective average action $\Gamma^\Lambda_k$ that
depends on both cutoffs, but if the already computed $S^\Lambda$ is used, we
show how $\Gamma^\Lambda_k$ can also be computed from $\Gamma_k$ by a
tree-level expansion, and that $\Gamma^\Lambda_k\to\Gamma_k$ as
$\Lambda\to\infty$. Along the way we show that Legendre effective actions with
different UV cutoff profiles, but which correspond to the same Wilsonian
effective action, are related through tree-level expansions. All these
expansions follow from Legendre transform relationships that can be derived
from the original one between $\Gamma^\Lambda_k$ and $S^k$.
