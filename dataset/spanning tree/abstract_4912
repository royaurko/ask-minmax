A numerical semigroup is said to be ordinary if it has all its gaps in a row.
Indeed, it contains zero and all integers from a given positive one. One can
define a simple operation on a non-ordinary semigroup, which we call here the
ordinarization transform, by removing its smallest non-zero non-gap (the
multiplicity) and adding its largest gap (the Frobenius number). This gives
another numerical semigroup and by repeating this transform several times we
end up with an ordinary semigroup. The genus, that is, the number of gaps, is
kept constant in all the transforms.
  This procedure allows the construction of a tree for each given genus
containing all semigrpoups of that genus and rooted in the unique ordinary
semigroup of that genus. We study here the regularity of these trees and the
number of semigroups at each depth. For some depths it is proved that the
number of semigroups increases with the genus and it is conjectured that this
happens at all given depths. This may give some lights to a former conjecture
saying that the number of semigroups of a given genus increases with the genus.
  We finally give an identification between semigroups at a given depth in the
ordinarization tree and semigroups with a given (large) number of gap intervals
and we give an explicit characterization of those semigroups.
