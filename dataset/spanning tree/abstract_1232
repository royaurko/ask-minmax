We study fragmentation of a random recursive tree into a forest by repeated
removal of nodes. The initial tree consists of N nodes and it is generated by
sequential addition of nodes with each new node attaching to a
randomly-selected existing node. As nodes are removed from the tree, one at a
time, the tree dissolves into an ensemble of separate trees, namely, a forest.
We study statistical properties of trees and nodes in this heterogeneous
forest, and find that the fraction of remaining nodes m characterizes the
system in the limit N --> infty. We obtain analytically the size density phi_s
of trees of size s. The size density has power-law tail phi_s ~ s^(-alpha) with
exponent alpha=1+1/m. Therefore, the tail becomes steeper as further nodes are
removed, and the fragmentation process is unusual in that exponent alpha
increases continuously with time. We also extend our analysis to the case where
nodes are added as well as removed, and obtain the asymptotic size density for
growing trees.
