We consider the problem of how much edge connectivity is necessary to force a
graph G to contain a fixed graph H as an immersion. We show that if the maximum
degree in H is D, then all the examples of D-edge connected graphs which do not
contain H as a weak immersion must have a tree-like decomposition called a
tree-cut decomposition of bounded width. If we consider strong immersions, then
it is easy to see that there are arbitrarily highly edge connected graphs which
do not contain a fixed clique K_t as a strong immersion. We give a structure
theorem which roughly characterizes those highly edge connected graphs which do
not contain K_t as a strong immersion.
