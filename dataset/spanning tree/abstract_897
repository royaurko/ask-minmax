We consider the problem of counting straight-edge triangulations of a given
set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane. Until very recently it was not known
whether the exact number of triangulations of $P$ can be computed
asymptotically faster than by enumerating all triangulations. We now know that
the number of triangulations of $P$ can be computed in $O^{*}(2^{n})$ time,
which is less than the lower bound of $\Omega(2.43^{n})$ on the number of
triangulations of any point set. In this paper we address the question of
whether one can approximately count triangulations in sub-exponential time. We
present an algorithm with sub-exponential running time and sub-exponential
approximation ratio, that is, denoting by $\Lambda$ the output of our
algorithm, and by $c^{n}$ the exact number of triangulations of $P$, for some
positive constant $c$, we prove that $c^{n}\leq\Lambda\leq c^{n}\cdot
2^{o(n)}$. This is the first algorithm that in sub-exponential time computes a
$(1+o(1))$-approximation of the base of the number of triangulations, more
precisely, $c\leq\Lambda^{\frac{1}{n}}\leq(1 + o(1))c$. Our algorithm can be
adapted to approximately count other crossing-free structures on $P$, keeping
the quality of approximation and running time intact. In this paper we show how
to do this for matchings and spanning trees.
