Accurate and densely populated BVRcIc lightcurves of supernovae SN 2011fe in
M101, SN 2012aw in M95 and SN 2012cg in NGC 4424 are presented and discussed.
The SN 2011fe lightcurve spans a total range of 342 days, from 17 days pre- to
325 days post-maximum. The observations of both SN 2012aw and SN 2012cg were
stopped by solar conjunction, when the objects were still bright. The
lightcurve for SN 2012aw covers 92 days, that of SN 2012cg spans 44 days. Time
and brightness of maxima are measured, and from the lightcurve shapes and
decline rates the absolute magnitudes are obtained, and the derived distances
are compared to that of the parent galaxies. The color evolution and the
bolometric lightcurves are evaluated in comparison with those of other well
observed supernovae, showing no significant deviations.
