Graph Isomorphism is the prime example of a computational problem with a wide
difference between the best known lower and upper bounds on its complexity. We
bridge this gap for a natural and important special case, planar graph
isomorphism, by presenting an upper bound that matches the known logspace
hardness [Lindell'92]. In fact, we show the formally stronger result that
planar graph canonization is in logspace. This improves the previously known
upper bound of AC1 [MillerReif'91].
  Our algorithm first constructs the biconnected component tree of a connected
planar graph and then refines each biconnected component into a triconnected
component tree. The next step is to logspace reduce the biconnected planar
graph isomorphism and canonization problems to those for 3-connected planar
graphs, which are known to be in logspace by [DattaLimayeNimbhorkar'08]. This
is achieved by using the above decomposition, and by making significant
modifications to Lindell's algorithm for tree canonization, along with changes
in the space complexity analysis.
  The reduction from the connected case to the biconnected case requires
further new ideas, including a non-trivial case analysis and a group theoretic
lemma to bound the number of automorphisms of a colored 3-connected planar
graph. This lemma is crucial for the reduction to work in logspace.
