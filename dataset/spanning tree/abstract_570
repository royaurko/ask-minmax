We develop two different methods to achieve subexponential time parameterized
algorithms for problems on sparse directed graphs. We exemplify our approaches
with two well studied problems.
  For the first problem, {\sc $k$-Leaf Out-Branching}, which is to find an
oriented spanning tree with at least $k$ leaves, we obtain an algorithm solving
the problem in time $2^{O(\sqrt{k} \log k)} n+ n^{O(1)}$ on directed graphs
whose underlying undirected graph excludes some fixed graph $H$ as a minor. For
the special case when the input directed graph is planar, the running time can
be improved to $2^{O(\sqrt{k})}n + n^{O(1)}$. The second example is a
generalization of the {\sc Directed Hamiltonian Path} problem, namely {\sc
$k$-Internal Out-Branching}, which is to find an oriented spanning tree with at
least $k$ internal vertices. We obtain an algorithm solving the problem in time
$2^{O(\sqrt{k} \log k)} + n^{O(1)}$ on directed graphs whose underlying
undirected graph excludes some fixed apex graph $H$ as a minor. Finally, we
observe that for any $\epsilon>0$, the {\sc $k$-Directed Path} problem is
solvable in time $O((1+\epsilon)^k n^{f(\epsilon)})$, where $f$ is some
function of $\ve$.
  Our methods are based on non-trivial combinations of obstruction theorems for
undirected graphs, kernelization, problem specific combinatorial structures and
a layering technique similar to the one employed by Baker to obtain PTAS for
planar graphs.
