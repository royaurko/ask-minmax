A two higgs doublet model with tree level natural flavor conservation can
lead to P and T odd nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction through tree level Feynman
diagrams. In this article we estimate the magnitudes of the parameters that
characterize the strength of the S-PS type of NN interaction. Stringent
constraints on the parameters can be derived from the measurement of EDM's of
Xe, Cs and Hg atoms in the ground state. We show that the predicted values of
the parameters lie close to such constraints provided ${\absvt\over \absvo }$
is large.
