We give a new data structure for the fully-dynamic minimum spanning forest
problem in simple graphs. Edge updates are supported in $O(\log^4n/\log\log n)$
amortized time per operation, improving the $O(\log^4n)$ amortized bound of
Holm et al. (STOC'98, JACM'01). We assume the Word-RAM model with standard
instructions.
