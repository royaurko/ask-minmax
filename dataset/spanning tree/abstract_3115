Fires and rainfall are major mechanisms that regulate woody and grassy
biomasses in savanna ecosystems. Conditions of long-lasting coexistence of
trees and grasses have been mainly studied using continuous-time modelling of
tree-grass competition. In these frameworks, fire is a time-continuous forcing
while the relationship between woody plant size and fire-sensitivity is not
systematically considered. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical
framework to model tree-grass interaction that takes into account both the
discrete nature of fire occurrence and size-dependent fire sensitivity (via two
classes of woody plants). We carry out a qualitative analysis that highlights
ecological thresholds and bifurcations parameters that shape the dynamics of
the savanna-like systems within the main ecological zones. Moreover, through a
qualitative analysis, we show that the impulsive modelling of fire occurrences
leads to more diverse behaviors and a more realistic array of solutions than
the analogous time-continuous fire models. Numerical simulations are provided
to illustrate the theoretical results and to support a discussion about the
bifurcation parameters and future developments.
