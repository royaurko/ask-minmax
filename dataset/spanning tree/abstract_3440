Recently, a color decomposition using structure constants was introduced for
purely gluonic tree amplitudes, in a compact form involving only the linearly
independent subamplitudes. We give two proofs that this decomposition holds for
an arbitrary number of gluons. We also present and prove similar decompositions
at one loop, both for pure gluon amplitudes and for amplitudes with an external
quark-antiquark pair.
