Certain vertex operator algebras have integral forms (integral spans of bases
which are closed under the countable set of products). It is unclear when they
(or integral multiples of them) are integral as lattices under the natural
bilinear form on the VOA. We show that lattice-integrality may be arranged
under some hypotheses, including cases of integral forms invariant by finite
groups. In particular, there exists a lattice-integral Monster-invariant
integral form in the Moonshine VOA.
