Ultrametric structure of the energy cascade process in a dynamical model of
turbulence is studied. The tree model we use can be viewed as an approximated
one-dimensional truncation of the wavelets resolved Navier-Stokes dynamics.
Varying the tree connectiveness, the appearance of a scaling transition in the
two-points moments of energy dissipation is detected, in agreement with
experimental turbulent data.
