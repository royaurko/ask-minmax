We discuss two constructions (long scrambling and ECM verbs) which challenge
most syntactic theories (including traditional TAG approaches) since they seem
to require exceptional mechanisms and postulates. We argue that these
constructions should in fact be analyzed in a similar manner, namely as
involving a verb which selects for a ``defective'' complement. These
complements are defective in that they lack certain Case-assigning abilities
(represented as functional heads). The constructions differ in how many such
abilities are lacking. Following the previous analysis of scrambling of Rambow
(1994), we propose a TAG analysis based on quasi-trees.
