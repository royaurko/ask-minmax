We study aspects of Wess-Zumino models related to SUSY and R-symmetry
breaking at tree-level. We present a recipe for constructing a wide class of
tree-level SUSY and R-breaking models. We also deduce a general property shared
by all tree-level SUSY breaking models that has broad application to model
building. In particular, it explains why many models of direct gauge mediation
have anomalously light gauginos (even if the R-symmetry is broken spontaneously
by an order one amount). This suggests new approaches to dynamical SUSY
breaking which can generate large enough gaugino masses.
