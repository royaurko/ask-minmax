In this paper a packet level simulator is used to explore the performance of
the proposed DLMT and CLMT algorithms under various traffic conditions.
Performance of the proposed algorithms is compared with already existing E-Span
tree structure. These proposed algorithms tend to extend the node lifetime in
order to increase the amount of information gathered by the tree root.
Decentralized lifetime maximizing tree (DLMT) features in nodes with higher
energy to be chosen as data aggregating parents while Centralized Lifetime
Maximizing Tree (CLMT) features with the identification of the bottleneck node
to collect data in a central manner among given set of nodes. By choosing
Forwarded Diffusion as our underlying routing platform the simulations are
carried on J-Sim. Our simulation results have shown that the functional
lifetime of event sources can be enhanced by a maximum of 147% when data is
aggregated via DLMT and by 139% when data is aggregated via CLMT. Our proposed
DLMT algorithm has shown maximum of 13% additional lifetime saving without
increasing the delay. Packet delivery ratio has also shown a remarkable
increase when the tree depth is considered in these proposed tree structures.
Furthermore, the delay is also reduced by using DLMT & CLMT in comparison with
E-Span.
