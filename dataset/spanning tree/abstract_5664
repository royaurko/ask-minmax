The method suggested by Lowell Brown for calculating multi-particle threshold
amplitudes is extended to the one-loop level in scalar theories with broken
reflection symmetry. A result for the threshold amplitude for multiparticle
production is derived. It is also shown that the tree-level amplitude for 2
on-mass-shell particles producing $n$ particles vanishes at the kinematical
threshold for $n>2$
