AdS_4/CFT_3 duality relating IIA string theory on AdS_4 x CP^3 to N=6
superconformal Chern-Simons theory provides an arena for studying aspects of
integrability in a new potentially exactly solvable system. In this paper we
explore the tree-level worldsheet scattering for strings on AdS_4 x CP^3. We
compute all bosonic four-, five- and six-point amplitudes in the gauge-fixed
action and demonstrate the absence of particle production.
