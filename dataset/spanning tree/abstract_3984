We study the distributed detection problem in the context of a balanced
binary relay tree, where the leaves of the tree correspond to $N$ identical and
independent sensors generating binary messages. The root of the tree is a
fusion center making an overall decision. Every other node is a relay node that
aggregates the messages received from its child nodes into a new message and
sends it up toward the fusion center. We derive upper and lower bounds for the
total error probability $P_N$ as explicit functions of $N$ in the case where
nodes and links fail with certain probabilities. These characterize the
asymptotic decay rate of the total error probability as $N$ goes to infinity.
Naturally, this decay rate is not larger than that in the non-failure case,
which is $\sqrt N$. However, we derive an explicit necessary and sufficient
condition on the decay rate of the local failure probabilities $p_k$
(combination of node and link failure probabilities at each level) such that
the decay rate of the total error probability in the failure case is the same
as that of the non-failure case. More precisely, we show that $\log
P_N^{-1}=\Theta(\sqrt N)$ if and only if $\log p_k^{-1}=\Omega(2^{k/2})$.
