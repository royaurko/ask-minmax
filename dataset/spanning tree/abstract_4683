We present experimental results on the shape of arches that block the outlet
of a two dimensional silo. For a range of outlet sizes, we measure some
properties of the arches such as the number of particles involved, the span,
the aspect ratio, and the angles between mutually stabilizing particles. These
measurements shed light on the role of frictional tangential forces in arching.
In addition, we find that arches tend to adopt an aspect ratio (the quotient
between height and half the span) close to one, suggesting an isotropic load.
The comparison of the experimental results with data from numerical models of
the arches formed in the bulk of a granular column reveals the similarities of
both, as well as some limitations in the few existing models.
