Multiple imputation is a common approach for dealing with missing values in
statistical databases. The imputer fills in missing values with draws from
predictive models estimated from the observed data, resulting in multiple,
completed versions of the database. Researchers have developed a variety of
default routines to implement multiple imputation; however, there has been
limited research comparing the performance of these methods, particularly for
categorical data. We use simulation studies to compare repeated sampling
properties of three default multiple imputation methods for categorical data,
including chained equations using generalized linear models, chained equations
using classification and regression trees, and a fully Bayesian joint
distribution based on Dirichlet Process mixture models. We base the simulations
on categorical data from the American Community Survey. The results suggest
that default chained equations approaches based on generalized linear models
are dominated by the default regression tree and mixture model approaches. They
also suggest competing advantages for the regression tree and mixture model
approaches, making both reasonable default engines for multiple imputation of
categorical data.
