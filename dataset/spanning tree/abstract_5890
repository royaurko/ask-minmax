Fractional pebbling is a generalization of black-white pebbling introduced
recently. In this reasearch paper we solve an open problem by proving a tight
lower bound on the pebble weight required to fractionally pebble a balanced
d-ary tree of height h. This bound has close ties with branching programs and
the separation of P from NL.
