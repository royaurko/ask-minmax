Kesten and Lee [36] proved that the total length of a minimal spanning tree
on certain random point configurations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfies a central
limit theorem. They also raised the question: how to make these results
quantitative? However, techniques employed to tackle the same problem for other
functionals studied in geometric probability do not apply directly to the
minimal spanning tree. Thus the problem of determining the convergence rate in
the central limit theorem for Euclidean minimal spanning trees has remained
open. In this work, we establish bounds on the convergence rate for the
Poissonized version of this problem by using a variation of Stein's method. We
also derive bounds on the convergence rate for the analogous problem in the
setup of the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$.
  The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we develop a general
technique to compute convergence rates in central limit theorems satisfied by
minimal spanning trees on sequence of weighted graphs which includes minimal
spanning trees on Poisson points. Secondly, we present a way of quantifying the
Burton-Keane argument for the uniqueness of the infinite open cluster. The
latter is interesting in its own right and based on a generalization of our
technique, Duminil-Copin, Ioffe and Velenik [28] have recently obtained bounds
on probability of two-arm events in a broad class of translation-invariant
percolation models.
