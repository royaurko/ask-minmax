For each integer $k\ge 1$, we define an algorithm which associates to a
partition whose maximal value is at most $k$ a certain subset of all
partitions. In the case when we begin with a partition $\lambda$ which is
square, i.e $\lambda=\lambda_1\ge...\ge\lambda_k>0$, and
$\lambda_1=k,\lambda_k=1$, then applying the algorithm $\ell$ times gives rise
to a set whose cardinality is either the Catalan number $c_{\ell-k+1}$ (the
self dual case) or twice the Catalan number. The algorithm defines a tree and
we study the propagation of the tree, which is not in the isomorphism class of
the usual Catalan tree. The algorithm can also be modified to produce a
two--parameter family of sets and the resulting cardinalities of the sets are
the ballot numbers. Finally, we give a conjecture on the rank of a particular
module for the ring of symmetric functions in $2\ell+m$ variables.
