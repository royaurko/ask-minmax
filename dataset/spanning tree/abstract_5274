The stability of nuclei is discussed with respect to the width of the
Gaussian wave packets within Quantum Molecular Dynamics model. A detailed study
is carried out by taking different equations of state (i.e., static soft and
hard and the momentum dependent soft and hard) for the selected nuclei from 12C
to 197Au. A comparison is done by using standard and broader Gaussian wave
packets. We find that the nuclei propagating with broader Gaussian wave packets
remain stable for entire reaction time span.
