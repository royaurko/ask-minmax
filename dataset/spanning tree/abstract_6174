The need for Knowledge and Data Discovery Management Systems (KDDMS) that
support ad hoc data mining queries has been long recognized. A significant
amount of research has gone into building tightly coupled systems that
integrate association rule mining with database systems. In this paper, we
describe a seamless integration scheme for database queries and association
rule discovery using a common query optimizer for both. Query trees of
expressions in an extended algebra are used for internal representation in the
optimizer. The algebraic representation is flexible enough to deal with
constrained association rule queries and other variations of association rule
specifications. We propose modularization to simplify the query tree for
complex tasks in data mining. It paves the way for making use of existing
algorithms for constructing query plans in the optimization process. How the
integration scheme we present will facilitate greater user control over the
data mining process is also discussed. The work described in this paper forms
part of a larger project for fully integrating data mining with database
management.
