This work builds on the notion of breadth-first signature of infinite trees
and (prefix-closed) languages introduced by the contributors in a previous work. We
focus here on periodic signatures, a case coming from the study of rational
base numeration systems; the language of integer representations in
base~$\frac{p}{q}$ has a purely periodic signature whose period is derived from
the Christoffel word of slope~$\frac{p}{q}$. Conversely, we characterise
languages whose signature are purely periodic as representations of integers in
such number systems with non-canonical alphabets of digits.
