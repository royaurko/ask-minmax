Let Gamma be a connected, locally finite graph of finite tree width and G be
a group acting on it with finitely many orbits and finite node stabilizers. We
provide an elementary and direct construction of a tree T on which G acts with
finitely many orbits and finite vertex stabilizers. Moreover, the tree is
defined directly in terms of the structure tree of optimally nested cuts of
Gamma.
  Once the tree is constructed, standard Bass-Serre theory yields that G is
virtually free. This approach simplifies the existing proofs for the
fundamental result of Muller and Schupp that characterizes context-free groups
as f.g. virtually free groups. Our construction avoids the explicit use of
Stallings' structure theorem and it is self-contained. We also give a
simplified proof for an important consequence of the structure tree theory by
Dicks and Dunwoody which has been stated by Thomassen and Woess. It says that a
f.g. group is accessible if and only if its Cayley graph is accessible.
