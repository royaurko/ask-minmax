We report phase sensitive measurements of microwave propagation through a
high mobility two dimensional electron gas subjected to a perpendicular
magnetic field. Two types of configurations were used, one that allows all wave
vectors q, and one that selects only specific q values. The spectrum of edge
excitations was studied over a broad frequency span, which allowed us to
observe the logarithmic dispersion of edge magneto-plasmons.
