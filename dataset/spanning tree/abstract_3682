We compute the first three terms of the 1/d expansions for the growth
constants and one-point functions of nearest-neighbour lattice trees and
lattice (bond) animals on the integer lattice Zd, with rigorous error
estimates. The proof uses the lace expansion, together with a new expansion for
the one-point functions based on inclusion-exclusion.
