We prove that if K is a Gruenhage compact space then C(K)* admits an
equivalent, strictly convex dual norm. As a corollary, we show that if X is a
Banach space and X* is the |.|-closed linear span of K, where K is a Gruenhage
compact in the w*-topology and |.| is equivalent to a coarser, w*-lower
semicontinuous norm on X*, then X* admits an equivalent, strictly convex dual
norm. We give a partial converse to the first result by showing that if T is a
tree, then C(T)* admits an equivalent, strictly convex dual norm if and only if
T is a Gruenhage space. Finally, we present some stability properties satisfied
by Gruenhage spaces; in particular, Gruenhage spaces are stable under perfect
images.
