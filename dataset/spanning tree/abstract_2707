In this paper, the contributor proposes optimal tree as a "gauge" for the
generation of the initial population at random in the Genetic Algorithms (GA)
to benchmark against the good and the bad parent tours. Thus, without having
the so-called bad parent tours in the initiate population, it will speed up the
GA. The characteristics of the gauge (algorithm, complexity time, trade-off,
etc.) will be discussed in this paper as well.
