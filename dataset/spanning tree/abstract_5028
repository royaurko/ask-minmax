We present optical spectroscopy of the dwarf nova HL Canis Majoris over a
span of four years. The observations were made during standstill, outburst, and
quiescence. We determine an orbital period of 0.2167867 +/- 0.0000017 days,
based on radial velocities determined from H-alpha, H-beta, and He I 5876
emission. We also present equivalent widths of the spectral features in
outburst and in quiescence.
