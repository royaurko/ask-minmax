In unitarity cut method, compact input of on-shell tree level amplitudes is
crucial to simplify calculations. Although BCFW on-shell recursion relation
gives very compact tree level amplitudes, they usually contain spurious poles.
In this paper, we present a method to deal with this issue and provide explicit
simple algebraic functions for various coefficients in the presence of spurious
poles. As an application, we present analytic result (not just rational term)
for one-loop five gluon A(-++++) with scalar propagator for the first time.
