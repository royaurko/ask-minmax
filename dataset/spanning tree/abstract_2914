We give an explicit formula for all tree amplitudes in N=4 SYM, derived by
solving the recently presented supersymmetric tree-level recursion relations.
The result is given in a compact, manifestly supersymmetric form and we show
how to extract from it all possible component amplitudes for an arbitrary
number of external particles and any arrangement of external particles and
helicities. We focus particularly on extracting gluon amplitudes which are
valid for any gauge theory. The formula for all tree-level amplitudes is given
in terms of nested sums of dual superconformal invariants and it therefore
manifestly respects both conventional and dual superconformal symmetry.
