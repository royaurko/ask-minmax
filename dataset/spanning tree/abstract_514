A graph G is dually chordal if there is a spanning tree T of G such that any
maximal clique of G induces a subtree in T. This paper investigates the
Colourability problem on dually chordal graphs. It will show that it is
NP-complete in case of four colours and solvable in linear time with a simple
algorithm in case of three colours. In addition, it will be shown that a dually
chordal graph is 3-colourable if and only if it is perfect and has no clique of
size four.
