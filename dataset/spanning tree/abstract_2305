Asymptotic analysis on some statistical properties of the random binary-tree
model is developed. We quantify a hierarchical structure of branching patterns
based on the Horton-Strahler analysis. We introduce a transformation of a
binary tree, and derive a recursive equation about branch orders. As an
application of the analysis, topological self-similarity and its generalization
is proved in an asymptotic sense. Also, some important examples are presented.
