Using the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on-board Fermi, we are monitoring the
hard X-ray/soft gamma ray sky using the Earth occultation technique. Each time
a source in our catalog enters or exits occultation by the Earth, we measure
its flux using the change in count rates due to the occultation. Currently we
are using CTIME data with 8 energy channels spanning 8 keV to 1 MeV for the GBM
NaI detectors and spanning 150 keV to 40 MeV for the GBM BGO detectors. Our
preliminary catalog consists of galactic X-ray binaries, the Crab Nebula, and
active galactic nuclei. In addition, to Earth occultations, we have observed
numerous occultations with Fermi's solar panels. We will present early results.
