The p-adic numbers have found applications in a wide range of diverse fields
of research. In some applications the algebraic properties of p-adics enter as
an indispensable ingredient of the theory. Another class of applications has to
do with hierarchical tree like systems. In this context the applications are
based on the well known correspondence between p-adics and the trees with
p-branches emerging from every branching point. Then the algebraic structure
does not enter and p-adics are used merely as a labeling system for the tree
branches. We introduce a space of numerical sequences suitable for labeling the
trees with varying number of branches emerging from the branching points. We
equipe this space with a non Archimedian metric and describe its basic
topological properties. We also demonstrate that the known construction of the
stochastic processes on p-adics carry over to the stochastic processes on the
above mentioned space and hence on the corresponding trees.
