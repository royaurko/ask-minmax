Document retrieval is one of the best established information retrieval
activities since the sixties, pervading all search engines. Its aim is to
obtain, from a collection of text documents, those most relevant to a pattern
query. Current technology is mostly oriented to "natural language" text
collections, where inverted indices are the preferred solution. As successful
as this paradigm has been, it fails to properly handle some East Asian
languages and other scenarios where the "natural language" assumptions do not
hold. In this survey we cover the recent research in extending the document
retrieval techniques to a broader class of sequence collections, which has
applications bioinformatics, data and Web mining, chemoinformatics, software
engineering, multimedia information retrieval, and many others. We focus on the
algorithmic aspects of the techniques, uncovering a rich world of relations
between document retrieval challenges and fundamental problems on trees,
strings, range queries, discrete geometry, and others.
