Cellular phone is one of the most developing technological artifacts today.
The evolution occurs through random innovation. Our effort is trying to view
the evolution of this artifact from memetics. By constructing a phylomemetic
tree based on cellular phone memes to infer or estimate the evolutionary
history and relationship among cellular phone. We adopt several methods, which
are commonly used in constructing phylogenetic tree, they are UPGMA algorithm
and Parsimony Maximum algorithm to construct cellphone phylomemetic tree.
Therefore we compare with the innovation tree, which is based on serial number
and their appearance time. From phylomemetic tree, we then analyze the process
of a cellular phone innovation through looking out on the cellular phone type
lies in the same cluster. The comparison of the simulation tree result shows a
generally different branching pattern, giving a presumption that innovation in
cellular phone is not really relating with their serial number, but occurs
merely because of random mutation of allomeme design and competes with its
technological development.
