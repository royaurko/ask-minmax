In the setup of i.i.d.~observations and a real valued differentiable
functional~$T$, locally asymptotic upper bounds are derived for the power of
one-sided tests (simple, versus large values of~$T$)and for the confidence
probability of lower confidence limits (for the value of~$T$), in the case that
the tangent set is only a convex cone. The bounds, and the tests and estimators
which achieve the bounds, are based on the projection of the influence curve of
the functional on the closed convex cone, as opposed to its closed linear span.
The higher efficiency comes along with some weaker, only one-sided, regularity
and stability.
