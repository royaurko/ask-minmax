The decidability of equivalence for three important classes of tree
transducers is discussed. Each class can be obtained as a natural restriction
of deterministic macro tree transducers (MTTs): (1) no context parameters,
i.e., top-down tree transducers, (2) linear size increase, i.e., MSO definable
tree transducers, and (3) monadic input and output ranked alphabets. For the
full class of MTTs, decidability of equivalence remains a long-standing open
problem.
