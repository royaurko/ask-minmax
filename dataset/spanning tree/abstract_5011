The XMM-Newton satellite has made four observations of the core of M31 as
part of a survey that will span the entire galaxy. The majority of the X-ray
emission is contributed by point sources, chiefly X-ray Binaries (XB). Exciting
early results from a survey of time variability in three XMM exposures of the
M31 core reveal XB exhibiting Sco X-1 like flaring, dips and a burst. The
flaring source in M31 also exhibits variability in intensity and spectral
hardness that is characteristic of a Z-source.
