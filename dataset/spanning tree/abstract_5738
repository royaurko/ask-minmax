We prove that a permutation group in which different finite sets have
different stabilizers cannot satisfy any group law. For locally compact
topological groups with this property we show that almost all finite subsets of
the group generate free subgroups.
  We derive consequences of these theorems on Thompson's group $F$, weakly
branch groups, automorphism groups of regular trees and profinite groups with
alternating composition factors of unbounded degree.
