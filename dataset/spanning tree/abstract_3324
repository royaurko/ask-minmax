Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane, we show how to compute in $O(n
\log n)$ time a subgraph of their Delaunay triangulation that has maximum
degree 7 and is a strong planar $t$-spanner of $P$ with $t =(1+ \sqrt{2})^2
*\delta$, where $\delta$ is the spanning ratio of the Delaunay triangulation.
Furthermore, given a Delaunay triangulation, we show a distributed algorithm
that computes the same bounded degree planar spanner in O(n) time.
