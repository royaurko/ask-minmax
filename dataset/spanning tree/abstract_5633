Let ${\rm Fin}(X)$ be the hyperspace consisting of non-empty finite subsets
of a space $X$ endowed with the Vietoris topology. In this paper, we
characterize a metrizable space $X$ whose hyperspace ${\rm Fin}(X)$ is
homeomorphic to the linear subspace spanned by the canonical orthonormal basis
of a non-separable Hilbert space.
