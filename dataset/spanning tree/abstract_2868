We search for the neutral Higgs sector of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric
standard model at LEP 2. At the tree level any experimental constraints on
$\tan \beta$ cannot be set by the Higgs search at LEP 2 with $\sqrt{s}$ = 175
GeV, whereas at LEP 2 with $\sqrt{s}$ = 192 GeV $\tan \beta$ can be set by an
experimental constraint. Furthermore the tree level parameter space of the
model can be completely explored by the Higgs search at LEP 2 with $\sqrt{s}$ =
205 GeV. Radiative corrections both to the neutral Higgs boson masses and to
the relevant couplings for the scalar Higgs productions give large
contributions to the production cross sections of the scalar Higgs bosons at
the tree level. The tree level situation at LEP 2 with $\sqrt{s}$ = 192 GeV as
well as with $\sqrt{s}$ = 205 GeV can be drastically changed by these effects.
We expect that a small region of the 1-loop level parameter space of the model
via the scalar Higgs production can be explored by the Higgs search at LEP 2.
