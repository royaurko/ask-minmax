The Gram-Schmidt algorithm produces a pairwise orthogonal set from a linearly
independent set of vectors in an inner product vector space V. We give a linear
algorithm that constructs vectors with the same span and which have pairwise
the same prescribed angle or distance, in all cases where this is possible.
Finally, we prove an asymptotic property in the case of an infinite dimensional
space V.
