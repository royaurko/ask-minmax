Top-down tree transducers are a convenient formalism for describing tree
transformations. They can be equipped with regular look-ahead, which allows
them to inspect a subtree before processing it. In certain cases, such a
look-ahead can be avoided and the transformation can be realized by a
transducer without look-ahead. Removing the look-ahead from a transducer, if
possible, is technically highly challenging. For a restricted class of
transducers with look-ahead, namely those that are total, deterministic,
ultralinear, and bounded erasing, we present an algorithm that, for a given
transducer from that class, (1) decides whether it is equivalent to a total
deterministic transducer without look-ahead, and (2) constructs such a
transducer if the answer is positive. For the whole class of total
deterministic transducers with look-ahead we present a similar algorithm, which
assumes that a so-called difference bound is known for the given transducer.
The designer of a transducer can usually also determine a difference bound for
it.
