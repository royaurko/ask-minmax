Recent progress in unitarity techniques for one-loop scattering amplitudes
makes a numerical implementation of this method possible. We present a
4-dimensional unitarity method for calculating the cut-constructible part of
amplitudes and implement the method in a numerical procedure. Our technique can
be applied to any one-loop scattering amplitude and offers the possibility that
one-loop calculations can be performed in an automatic fashion, as tree-level
amplitudes are currently done. Instead of individual Feynman diagrams, the
ingredients for our one-loop evaluation are tree-level amplitudes, which are
often already known. To study the practicality of this method we evaluate the
cut-constructible part of the 4, 5 and 6 gluon one-loop amplitudes numerically,
using the analytically known 4, 5 and 6 gluon tree-level amplitudes.
Comparisons with analytic answers are performed to ascertain the numerical
accuracy of the method.
