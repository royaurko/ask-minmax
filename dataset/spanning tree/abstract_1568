Let n be an integer greater than 1. A tree T is an n-ary tree provided that
every node in T has at most n immediate successors. A forcing notion P has the
n-localization property if every function from omega to omega in an extension
via P is an omega-branch in an n-ary tree from the ground model.
  In the present paper we are interested in getting the n-localization property
for countable support iterations.
