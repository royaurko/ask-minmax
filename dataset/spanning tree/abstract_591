We introduce a one-parameter family of massive Laplacian operators
$(\Delta^{m(k)})_{k\in[0,1)}$ defined on isoradial graphs, involving elliptic
functions. We prove an explicit formula for minus the inverse of
$\Delta^{m(k)}$, the massive Green function, which has the remarkable property
of only depending on the local geometry of the graph, and compute its
asymptotics. We study the corresponding statistical mechanics model of random
rooted spanning forests. We prove an explicit local formula for an infinite
volume Boltzmann measure, and for the free energy of the model. We show that
the model undergoes a second order phase transition at $k=0$, thus proving that
spanning trees corresponding to the Laplacian introduced by Kenyon are
critical. We prove that the massive Laplacian operators
$(\Delta^{m(k)})_{k\in(0,1)}$ provide a one-parameter family of $Z$-invariant
rooted spanning forest models. When the isoradial graph is moreover
$\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic, we consider the spectral curve $\mathcal{C}^k$ of the
characteristic polynomial of the massive Laplacian. We provide an explicit
parametrization of the curve and prove that it is Harnack and has genus 1. We
further show that every Harnack curve of genus 1 with
$(z,w)\leftrightarrow(z^{-1},w^{-1})$ symmetry arises from such a massive
Laplacian.
