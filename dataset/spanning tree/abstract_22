We obtain the numbers of spanning trees on the Sierpinski gasket $SG_d(n)$
with dimension $d$ equal to two, three and four. The general expression for the
number of spanning trees on $SG_d(n)$ with arbitrary $d$ is conjectured. The
numbers of spanning trees on the generalized Sierpinski gasket $SG_{d,b}(n)$
with $d=2$ and $b=3,4$ are also obtained.
