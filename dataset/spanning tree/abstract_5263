We demonstrate the steady-state entanglement of two two-level atoms inside a
pumped cavity with photon leakage through a nonlinear mirror and through
spontaneous decay, and show that the entanglement is enhanced by the presence
of a nonlinear mirror. Our model assumes the vacuum Rabi splitting of the
dressed states of the system to be much larger than any of the decay parameters
of the system. We also discuss how the dressed states of the system offer us
intuition as to where the entanglement lies in the state space spanned by the
system, and allow us the optimize the system.
