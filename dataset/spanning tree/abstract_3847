Given a rooted tree T, the level ancestor problem is the problem of answering
queries of the form LA(v, d), which identify the level d ancestor of a node v
in the tree. Several algorithms of varied complexity have been proposed in the
literature, including optimal solutions that preprocess T in linear bounded
time and proceed to answer queries in constant bounded time. Despite its
significance and numerous applications, to date there have been no comparative
studies of the performance of these algorithms and no implementations are
widely available. In our experimental study we have implemented and compared
several solutions for the level ancestor problem, including two optimal
algorithms, and examine their space requirements and time performance.
