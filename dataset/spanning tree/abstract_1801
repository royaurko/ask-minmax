We consider three different schemes for signal routing on a tree. The
vertices of the tree represent transceivers that can transmit and receive
signals, and are equipped with i.i.d. weights representing the strength of the
transceivers. The edges of the tree are also equipped with i.i.d. weights,
representing the costs for passing the edges. For each one of our schemes, we
derive sharp conditions on the distributions of the vertex weights and the edge
weights that determine when the root can transmit a signal over arbitrarily
large distances.
