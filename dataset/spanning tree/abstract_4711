This paper reports on the preliminary simulation work for a 1-meter class
tropical cyclone UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) based on the Formula-One AR-6
Endeavor full-sized airplane. Variants with different wing span are evaluated
using the popular RealFlight radio-control simulator. The 84 cm wing-span
platform achieves a maximum cruising speed (Vh) of 407 kmh-1 and demonstrates
responsive flight controls throughout its flight envelope even in sustained
wind speed of 225 kmh-1. Being a small and agile UAV, it can be flown below the
storm to measure surface wind directly and avoid possible uncertainty
associated with the vertical wind profile adjustment. Chute-free vertical
retardation technique is also proposed. The ultimate aim of the research is to
develop cost effective UAVs that can be employed in a multi-agent setting to
acquire high resolution data to enhance understanding of cyclogenesis and to
make better predictions.
