Traditional Quartet Puzzling algorithms use maximum likelihood methods to
reconstruct quartet trees, and a puzzling algorithm to combine these quartets
into a tree for the full collection of $n$ taxa. We propose a variation of
Quartet Puzzling in which the quartet trees are reconstructed using
biologically symmetric invariants. We find that under certain conditions,
invariant based quartet puzzling outperforms Quartet Puzzling using maximum
likelihood.
