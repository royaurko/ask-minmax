We study properties of the harmonic measure of balls in typical large
discrete trees. For a ball of radius n centered at the root, we prove that,
although the size of the boundary is of order n, most of the harmonic measure
is supported on a boundary set of size approximately equal to n^\beta, where
{\beta} =0.78... is a universal constant. To derive such results, we interpret
harmonic measure as the exit distribution of the ball by simple random walk on
the tree, and we first deal with the case of critical Galton-Watson trees
conditioned to have height greater than n. An important ingredient of our
approach is the analogous continuous model (related to Aldous' continuum random
tree), where the dimension of harmonic measure of a level set of the tree is
equal to \beta, whereas the dimension of any level set is equal to 1. The
constant {\beta} is expressed in terms of the asymptotic distribution of the
conductance of large critical Galton-Watson trees.
