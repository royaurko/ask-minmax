The GR@PPA event generator has been updated to version 2.7. This distribution
provides event generators for $V$ ($W$ or $Z$) + jets ($\leq$ 4 jets), $VV$ +
jets ($\leq$ 2 jets) and QCD multi-jet ($\leq$ 4 jets) production processes at
$pp$ and $p\bar{p}$ collisions, in addition to the four bottom quark
productions implemented in our previous work (GR@PPA\_4b). Also included are
the top-pair and top-pair + jet production processes, where the correlation
between the decay products are fully reproduced at the tree level. Namely,
processes up to seven-body productions can be simulated, based on ordinary
Feynman diagram calculations at the tree level. In this version, the GR@PPA
framework and the process dependent matrix-element routines are separately
provided. This makes it easier to add further new processes, and allows users
to make a choice of processes to implement. This version also has several new
features to handle complicated multi-body production processes. A systematic
way to combine many subprocesses to a single base-subprocess has been
introduced, and a new method has been adopted to calculate the color factors of
complicated QCD processes. They speed up the calculation significantly.
