This paper describes a new and purely functional implementation technique of
binary heaps. A binary heap is a tree-based data structure that implements
priority queue operations (insert, remove, minimum/maximum) and guarantees at
worst logarithmic running time for them. Approaches and ideas described in this
paper present a simple and asymptotically optimal implementation of immutable
binary heap.
