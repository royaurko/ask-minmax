We introduce canonical correlation forests (CCFs), a new decision tree
ensemble method for classification. Individual canonical correlation trees are
binary decision trees with hyperplane splits based on canonical correlation
components. Unlike axis-aligned alternatives, the decision surfaces of CCFs are
not restricted to the coordinate system of the input features and therefore
more naturally represent data with correlation between the features.
Additionally we introduce a novel alternative to bagging, the projection
bootstrap, which maintains use of the full dataset in selecting split points.
CCFs do not require parameter tuning and our experiments show that they
significantly out-perform axis-aligned random forests and other
state-of-the-art tree ensemble methods.
