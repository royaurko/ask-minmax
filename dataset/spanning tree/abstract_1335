Generating trees are a useful technique in the enumeration of various
combinatorial objects, particularly restricted permutations. Quite often the
generating tree for the set of permutations avoiding a set of patterns requires
infinitely many labels. Sometimes, however, this generating tree needs only
finitely many labels. We characterize the finite sets of patterns for which
this phenomenon occurs. We also present an algorithm - in fact, a special case
of an algorithm of Zeilberger - that is guaranteed to find such a generating
tree if it exists.
