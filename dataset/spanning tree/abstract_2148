We study protected nodes in $m$-ary search trees, by putting them in context
of generalised P\'olya urns. We show that the number of two-protected nodes
(the nodes that are neither leaves nor parents of leaves) in a random ternary
search tree is asymptotically normal. The methods apply in principle to $m
$-ary search trees with larger $m$ as well, although the size of the matrices
used in the calculations grow rapidly with $ m $; we conjecture that the method
yields an asymptotically normal distribution for all $m\leq 26$.
  The one-protected nodes, and their complement, i.e., the leaves, are easier
to analyze. By using a simpler P\'olya urn (that is similar to the one that has
earlier been used to study the total number of nodes in $ m $-ary search
trees), we prove normal limit laws for the number of one-protected nodes and
the number of leaves for all $ m\leq 26 $.
