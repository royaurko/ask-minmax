Given a finite set $X$, a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of rooted phylogenetic
trees on $X$ and an integer $k$, the Hybridization Number problem asks if there
exists a phylogenetic network on $X$ that displays all trees from $\mathcal{T}$
and has reticulation number at most $k$. We show two kernelization algorithms
for Hybridization Number, with kernel sizes $4k(5k)^t$ and $20k^2(\Delta^+-1)$
respectively, with $t$ the number of input trees and $\Delta^+$ their maximum
outdegree. In addition, we present an $O(n^{f(k)})$ time algorithm, with
$n=|X|$ and $f$ some computable function of $k$.
