We detect anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at degree
angular scales and confirm a previous detection reported by Wollack et al.
(1993). The root-mean-squared amplitude of the fluctuations is $44^{+13}_{-7}
\mu$K. This may be expressed as the square root of the angular power spectrum
in a band of multipoles between $l_{eff}=69^{+29}_{-22}$. We find $\delta T_l =
\sqrt{l(2l+1)<|a_l^m|^2>/4\pi} = 42^{+12}_{-7} \mu$K. The measured spectral
index of the fluctuations is consistent with zero, the value expected for the
CMB. The spectral index corresponding to Galactic free-free emission, the most
likely foreground contaminant, is rejected at approximately $3\sigma$.
  The analysis is based on three independent data sets. The first, taken in
1993, spans the 26 - 36 GHz frequency range with three frequency bands; the
second was taken with the same radiometer as the first but during an
independent observing campaign in 1994; and the third, also take in 1994, spans
the 36-46 GHz range in three bands. For each telescope position and radiometer
channel, the drifts in the instrument offset are $\le 4~\mu$K/day over a period
of one month. The dependence of the inferred anisotropy on the calibration and
data editing is addressed.
