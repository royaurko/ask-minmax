Given an undirected graph $G$ and a parameter $k$, the $k$-Leaf Spanning Tree
($k$-LST) problem asks if $G$ contains a spanning tree with at least $k$
leaves. This problem has been extensively studied over the past three decades.
In 2000, Fellows et al. [FSTTCS'00] explicitly asked whether it admits a klam
value of 50. A steady progress towards an affirmative answer continued until 5
years ago, when an algorithm of klam value 37 was discovered. In this paper, we
present an $O^*(3.188^k)$-time parameterized algorithm for $k$-LST, which shows
that the problem admits a klam value of 39. Our algorithm is based on an
interesting application of the well-known bounded search trees technique, where
the correctness of rules crucially depends on the history of previously applied
rules in a non-standard manner.
