For elliptic principal bundles $\pi:X\ra B$ over
  K\"ahler manifolds it was shown by Blanchard that $X$ has a K\"ahler metric
if and only both Chern classes (with real coefficients) of $\pi$ vanish. For
some elliptic principal bundles, when the span of these Chern classes is
1-dimensional, it was shown by Vaisman that $X$ carry locally conformally
K\"ahler (LCK, for short) metrics. We show that in the case when the Chern
classes are linearly independent, $X$ carries no LCK metric.
