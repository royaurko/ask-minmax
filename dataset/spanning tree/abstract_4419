We present a particularly nice D-dimensional graph-based representation of
the full color-dressed five-point tree-level gluon amplitude. It possesses the
following virtues: 1) it satisfies the color-kinematic correspondence, and thus
trivially generates the associated five-point graviton amplitude, 2) all
external state information is encoded in color-ordered partial amplitudes, and
3) one function determines the kinematic contribution of all graphs in the
Yang-Mills amplitude, so the associated gravity amplitude is manifestly
permutation symmetric. The third virtue, while shared among all known
loop-level correspondence-satisfying representations, is novel for tree-level
representations sharing the first two virtues. This new D-dimensional
representation makes contact with the recently found multiloop five-point
representations, suggesting all-loop, all-multiplicity ramifications through
unitarity. Additionally we present a slightly less virtuous representation of
the six-point MHV and MHVbar amplitudes which holds only in four dimensions.
