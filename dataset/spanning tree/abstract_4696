Since beginning of Grid computing, scheduling of dependent tasks application
has attracted attention of researchers due to NP-Complete nature of the
problem. In Grid environment, scheduling is deciding about assignment of tasks
to available resources. Scheduling in Grid is challenging when the tasks have
dependencies and resources are heterogeneous. The main objective in scheduling
of dependent tasks is minimizing make-span. Due to NP-complete nature of
scheduling problem, exact solutions cannot generate schedule efficiently.
Therefore, researchers apply heuristic or random search techniques to get
optimal or near to optimal solution of such problems. In this paper, we show
how Genetic Algorithm can be used to solve dependent task scheduling problem.
We describe how initial population can be generated using random assignment and
height based approaches. We also present design of crossover and mutation
operators to enable scheduling of dependent tasks application without violating
dependency constraints. For implementation of GA based scheduling, we explore
and analyze SimGrid and GridSim simulation toolkits. From results, we found
that SimGrid is suitable, as it has support of SimDag API for DAG applications.
We found that GA based approach can generate schedule for dependent tasks
application in reasonable time while trying to minimize make-span.
