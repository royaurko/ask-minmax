We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a big and nef line bundle L
of any degree on a K3 surface or Enriques surface to be k-very ample and
k-spanned. Furthermore, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a
spanned and big line bundle on a K3 surface to be birationally k-very ample and
birationally k-spanned, and relate these concepts to the Clifford index and
gonality of smooth curves in |L|.
