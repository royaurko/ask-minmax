In this paper we prove that the lack of uniqueness for solutions of the tree
dyadic model of turbulence is overcome with the introduction of a suitable
noise. The uniqueness is a weak probabilistic uniqueness for all $l^2$-initial
conditions and is proven using a technique relying on the properties of the
$q$-matrix associated to a continuous time Markov chain.
