Minimum braids are a complete invariant of knots and links. This paper
defines minimum braids, describes how they can be generated, presents tables
for knots up to ten crossings and oriented links up to nine crossings, and uses
minimum braids to study graph trees, amphicheirality, unknotting numbers, and
periodic tables.
