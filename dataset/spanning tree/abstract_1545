Consider the problem of determining whether there exists a spanning hypertree
in a given k-uniform hypergraph. This problem is trivially in P for k=2, and is
NP-complete for k>= 4, whereas for k=3, there exists a polynomial-time
algorithm based on Lovasz' theory of polymatroid matching. Here we give a
completely different, randomized polynomial-time algorithm in the case k=3. The
main ingredients are a Pfaffian formula by Vaintrob and one of the contributors
(G.M.) for a polynomial that enumerates spanning hypertrees with some signs,
and a lemma on the number of roots of polynomials over a finite field.
