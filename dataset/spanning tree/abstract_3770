We describe a generating tree approach to the enumeration and exhaustive
generation of k-nonnesting set partitions and permutations. Unlike previous
work in the literature using the connections of these objects to Young tableaux
and restricted lattice walks, our approach deals directly with partition and
permutation diagrams. We provide explicit functional equations for the
generating functions, with k as a parameter.
