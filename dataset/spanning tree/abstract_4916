There is a deep connection between permutations and trees. Certain
sub-structures of permutations, called sub-permutations, bijectively map to
sub-trees of binary increasing trees. This opens a powerful tool set to study
enumerative and probabilistic properties of sub-permutations and to investigate
the relationships between 'local' and 'global' features using the concept of
pattern avoidance. First, given a pattern {\mu}, we study how the avoidance of
{\mu} in a permutation {\pi} affects the presence of other patterns in the
sub-permutations of {\pi}. More precisely, considering patterns of length 3, we
solve instances of the following problem: given a class of permutations K and a
pattern {\mu}, we ask for the number of permutations $\pi \in Av_n(\mu)$ whose
sub-permutations in K satisfy certain additional constraints on their size.
Second, we study the probability for a generic pattern to be contained in a
random permutation {\pi} of size n without being present in the
sub-permutations of {\pi} generated by the entry $1 \leq k \leq n$. These
theoretical results can be useful to define efficient randomized pattern-search
procedures based on classical algorithms of pattern-recognition, while the
general problem of pattern-search is NP-complete.
