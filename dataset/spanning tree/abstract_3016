The aim of this paper is to study rumor processes in random environment. In a
rumor process a signal starts from the stations of a fixed vertex (the root)
and travels on a graph from vertex to vertex. We consider two rumor processes.
In the firework process each station, when reached by the signal, transmits it
up to a random distance. In the reverse firework process, on the other hand,
stations do not send any signal but they "listen" for it up to a random
distance. The first random environment that we consider is the deterministic
1-dimensional tree N with a random number of stations on each vertex; in this
case the root is the origin of N. We give conditions for the
survival/extinction on almost every realization of the sequence of stations.
Later on, we study the processes on Galton-Watson trees with random number of
stations on each vertex. We show that if the probability of survival is
positive, then there is survival on almost every realization of the infinite
tree such that there is at least one station at the root. We characterize the
survival of the process in some cases and we give sufficient conditions for
survival/extinction.
