The square of a connected graph $G$ is obtained from $G$ by adding an edge
between every pair of vertices at distance $2$. In this paper we give some
upper or lower bounds for the spectral radius of the square of connected
graphs, trees and unicyclic graphs respectively.We also investigate the
spectral radius of the square of unicyclic graphs with given girth or trees
with fixed diameter.
