We report on a new method for the numerical evaluation of loop integrals,
based on the Feynman Tree Theorem. The loop integrals are replaced by
phase-space integration over fictitious extra on-shell particles. This
integration can be performed alongside with the Monte-Carlo integration of
ordinary phase-space, directly leading to NLO event generation.
