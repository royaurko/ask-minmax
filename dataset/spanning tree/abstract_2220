In models where the suppression of the tree level couplings of fermions with
Goldstone bosons is not protected by symmetry, the loop-induced couplings can
in general dominate over the tree couplings. We demonstrate this by calculating
the decay $\nu\to \nu' + \mbox{Majoron}$ in the simplest singlet Majoron model.
It is shown that 1-loop contributions can be orders of magnitude bigger than
the tree-level result, and hence allows a wide range of interesting values of
neutrino mass and mixing to be compatible with cosmological constraints.
