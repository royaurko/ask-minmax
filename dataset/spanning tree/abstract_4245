Understanding the patterns and processes of diversification of life in the
planet is a key challenge of science. The Tree of Life represents such
diversification processes through the evolutionary relationships among the
different taxa, and can be extended down to intra-specific relationships. Here
we examine the topological properties of a large set of interspecific and
intraspecific phylogenies and show that the branching patterns follow
allometric rules conserved across the different levels in the Tree of Life, all
significantly departing from those expected from the standard null models. The
finding of non-random universal patterns of phylogenetic differentiation
suggests that similar evolutionary forces drive diversification across the
broad range of scales, from macro-evolutionary to micro-evolutionary processes,
shaping the diversity of life on the planet.
