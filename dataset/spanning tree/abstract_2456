We introduce a new combinatorial structure: the metasylvester lattice on
decreasing trees. It appears in the context of the $m$-Tamari lattices and
other related $m$-generalizations. The metasylvester congruence has been
recently introduced by Novelli and Thibon. We show that it defines a sublattice
of the $m$-permutations where elements can be represented by decreasing
labelled trees: the metasylvester lattice. We study the combinatorial
properties of this new structure. In particular, we give different realizations
of the lattice. The $m$-Tamari lattice is by definition a sublattice of our
newly defined metasylvester lattice. It leads us to a new realization of the
$m$-Tamari lattice, using certain chains of the classical Tamari lattice.
