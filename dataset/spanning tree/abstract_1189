The Wiener index of a graph is the sum of the distances between all pairs of
vertices, it has been one of the main descriptors that correlate achemical
compound's molecular graph with experimentally gathered data regarding the
compound's characteristics. The tree that minimizes the Wiener index among
trees of given maximal degree was studied. We characterize trees that achieve
the maximum and minimum Wiener index, given the number of vertices and the
degree sequence.
