We consider random dynamics on the edges of a uniform Cayley tree with $n$
vertices, in which edges are either inflammable, fireproof, or burt. Every
inflammable edge is replaced by a fireproof edge at unit rate, while fires
start at smaller rate $n^{-\alpha}$ on each inflammable edge, then propagate
through the neighboring inflammable edges and are only stopped at fireproof
edges. A vertex is called fireproof when all its adjacent edges are fireproof.
We show that as $n\to \infty$, the density of fireproof vertices converges to
$1$ when $\alpha>1/2$, to $0$ when $\alpha<1/2$, and to some non-degenerate
random variable when $\alpha=1/2$. We further study the connectivity of the
fireproof forest, in particular the existence of a giant component.
