We describe the explicit construction of groves, the smallest gauge invariant
classes of tree Feynman diagrams in gauge theories. The construction is valid
for gauge theories with any number of group factors which may be mixed. It
requires no summation over a complete gauge group multiplet of external matter
fields. The method is therefore suitable for defining gauge invariant classes
of Feynman diagrams for processes with many observed final state particles in
the standard model and its extensions.
