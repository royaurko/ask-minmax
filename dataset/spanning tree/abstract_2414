The paper describes an explicit combinatorial formula for a harmonic vector
for the Laplacian of a directed graph with arbitrary edge weights. This result
was motivated by questions from mathematical economics, and the formula plays a
crucial role in forthcoming joint work of the contributor on the emergence of prices
and money in an exchange economy.
  It turns out that the formula is closely related to well-studied problems in
graph theory, in particular to the so-called matrix tree theorem due to W.
Tutte and independently to R. Bott and J. Mayberry. As a further application of
our considerations, we obtain a short new proof of both the matrix tree theorem
as well as its generalization due to S. Chaiken.
