Consider a class of null-recurrent randomly biased walks on a super-critical
Gaton-Watson tree. We obtain the scaling limits of the local times and the
quenched local probability for the biased walk in the sub-diffusive case. These
results are a consequence of a sharp estimate on the return time, whose
analysis is driven by a family of concave recursive equations on trees.
