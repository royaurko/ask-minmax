The stability number of a graph G, denoted by alpha(G), is the cardinality of
a maximum stable set, and mu(G) is the cardinality of a maximum matching in G.
If alpha(G) + mu(G) equals its order, then G is a Koenig-Egervary graph. We
call G an $\alpha $-square-stable graph, shortly square-stable, if alpha(G) =
alpha(G*G), where G*G denotes the second power of G. These graphs were first
investigated by Randerath and Wolkmann. In this paper we obtain several new
characterizations of square-stable graphs. We also show that G is an
square-stable Koenig-Egervary graph if and only if it has a perfect matching
consisting of pendant edges. Moreover, we find that well-covered trees are
exactly square-stable trees. To verify this result we give a new proof of one
Ravindra's theorem describing well-covered trees.
