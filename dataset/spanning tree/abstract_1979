A scaling theory is used to derive the dependence of the average number <k>
of spanning clusters at threshold on the lattice size L. This number should
become independent of L for dimensions d<6, and vary as log L at d=6. The
predictions for d>6 depend on the boundary conditions, and the results there
may vary between L^{d-6} and L^0. While simulations in six dimensions are
consistent with this prediction (after including corrections of order loglog
L), in five dimensions the average number of spanning clusters still increases
as log L even up to L = 201. However, the histogram P(k) of the spanning
cluster multiplicity does scale as a function of kX(L), with X(L)=1+const/L,
indicating that for sufficiently large L the average <k> will approach a finite
value: a fit of the 5D multiplicity data with a constant plus a simple linear
correction to scaling reproduces the data very well. Numerical simulations for
d>6 and for d=4 are also presented.
