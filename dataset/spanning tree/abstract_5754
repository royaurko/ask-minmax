We introduce a notion of Dyck paths with coloured ascents. For several ways
of colouring, we establish bijections between sets of such paths and other
combinatorial structures, such as non-crossing trees, dissections of a convex
polygon, etc. In some cases enumeration gives new expression for sequences
enumerating these structures.
