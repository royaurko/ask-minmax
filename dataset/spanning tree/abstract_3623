We use the pure spinor formalism to obtain the supersymmetric massless
five-point amplitude at tree-level in a streamlined fashion. We also prove the
equivalence of an OPE identity in string theory with a subset of the
Bern-Carrasco-Johansson five-point kinematic relations, and demonstrate how the
remaining BCJ identities follow from the different integration regions over the
open string world-sheet, therefore providing a first principles derivation of
the (supersymmetric) BCJ identities.
