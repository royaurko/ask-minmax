In this paper we establish all extremal graphs with respect to augmented
eccentric connectivity index among all (simple connected) graphs, among trees
and among trees with perfect matching. For graphs that turn out to be extremal
explicit formulas for the value of augmented eccentric connectivity index are
derived.
