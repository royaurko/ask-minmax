We analyse a light-like cusped Wilson loop in N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons
theory at both weak and strong coupling in light-cone gauge. At the second
order in the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ the correct cusp anomalous dimension
$\Gamma_{\rm cusp}=-\phi / 2 \lambda^2$ is recovered through a deformation of
the contour that takes both rays of the cusp slightly off of the light-cone.
The strong coupling behaviour is addressed by means of the Bethe-Salpeter
equation for ladders of tree-level gauge propagators and ladders of one-loop
corrected gauge propagators. It turns out that, as might be expected, the
contribution of Chern-Simons tree-level propagators is insensitive of the cusp
angle $\phi$. On the other hand, corrected propagators lead to an exponential
large $\lambda$ behaviour $\Gamma_{\rm cusp} \sim \exp\sqrt{\lambda\phi}$
which, though, disagrees with the AdS/CFT predictions in the power of $\phi$.
