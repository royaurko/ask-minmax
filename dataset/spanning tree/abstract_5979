We consider a model for topological recursion based on the Hopf Algebra of
planar binary trees of Loday and Ronco. We show that extending this Hopf
Algebra by identifying pairs of nearest neighbor leaves and producing in this
way graphs with loops we obtain the full recursion formula of Eynard and
Orantin.
