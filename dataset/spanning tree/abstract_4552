We define a collection of functions $s_i$ on the set of plane trees (or Young
tableaux). The functions are adapted from transpositions in the representation
theory of the symmetric group and almost form a group action. They were
motivated by local moves in combinatorial biology, which are maps that
represent a certain unfolding and refolding of RNA strands. One main result of
this manuscript identifies a subset of local moves that we call $s_i$-local
moves, and proves that $s_i$-local moves correspond to our maps. We also prove
that the graph of $s_i$-local moves is a connected, graded poset with unique
minimal and maximal elements. We then extend this discussion to functions
$s_i^C$ that mimic reflections in the Weyl group of type $C$. The corresponding
graph is no longer connected, but we prove it has two connected components, one
of symmetric and the other of asymmetric plane trees. We give open questions
and possible biological interpretations.
