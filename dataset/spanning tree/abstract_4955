A ternary permutation constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is specified by a
subset Pi of the symmetric group S_3. An instance of such a problem consists of
a set of variables V and a set of constraints C, where each constraint is an
ordered triple of distinct elements from V. The goal is to construct a linear
order alpha on V such that, for each constraint (a,b,c) in C, the ordering of
a,b,c induced by alpha is in Pi. Excluding symmetries and trivial cases there
are 11 such problems, and their complexity is well known. Here we consider the
variant of the problem, denoted 2-Pi, where we are allowed to construct two
linear orders alpha and beta and each constraint needs to be satisfied by at
least one of the two. We give a full complexity classification of all 11 2-Pi
problems, observing that in the switch from one to two linear orders the
complexity landscape changes quite abruptly and that hardness proofs become
rather intricate. We then focus on one of the 11 problems in particular, which
is closely related to the '2-Caterpillar Compatibility' problem in the
phylogenetics literature. We show that this particular CSP remains hard on
three linear orders, and also in the biologically relevant case when we swap
three linear orders for three phylogenetic trees, yielding the '3-Tree
Compatibility' problem. Due to the biological relevance of this problem we also
give extremal results concerning the minimum number of trees required, in the
worst case, to satisfy a set of rooted triplet constraints on n leaf labels.
