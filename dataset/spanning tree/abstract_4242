Courcelle's Theorem states that every problem definable in Monadic
Second-Order logic can be solved in linear time on structures of bounded
treewidth, for example, by constructing a tree automaton that recognizes or
rejects a tree decomposition of the structure. Existing, optimized software
like the MONA tool can be used to build the corresponding tree automata, which
for bounded treewidth are of constant size. Unfortunately, the constants
involved can become extremely large - every quantifier alternation requires a
power set construction for the automaton. Here, the required space can become a
problem in practical applications.
  In this paper, we present a novel, direct approach based on model checking
games, which avoids the expensive power set construction. Experiments with an
implementation are promising, and we can solve problems on graphs where the
automata-theoretic approach fails in practice.
