The cross sections for $D^0 {\bar D}^0$ and $D^+D^-$ production at 3.773 GeV
have been measured with BES-II detector at BEPC. These measurements are made by
analyzing a data sample of about 17.3 $\rm pb^{-1}$ collected at the
center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV. Observed cross sections for the charm pair
production are radiatively corrected to obtain the tree level cross section for
$D\bar D$ production. A measurement of the total tree level hadronic cross
section is obtained from the tree level $D \bar D$ cross section and an
extrapolation of the $R_{uds}$ below the open charm threshold.
