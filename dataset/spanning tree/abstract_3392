The fractal structure of a white cauliflower is investigated by box-counting
method of its cross-section. The capacity dimension of the cross-section is
$1.88 \pm 0.02$ independent of directions. From the result, we predict that the
capacity dimension of the cauliflower is about 2.8. The vertical cross-section
of the cauliflower is modeled into a self-similar set of a rectangular tree. We
discuss the condition of the fractal object in the tree, and show that the
vertical cross-section has an angle of 67 degrees in our model.
