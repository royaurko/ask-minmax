Reconciling a gene tree with a species tree is an important task that reveals
much about the evolution of genes, genomes, and species, as well as about the
molecular function of genes. A wide array of computational tools have been
devised for this task under certain evolutionary events such as hybridization,
gene duplication/loss, or incomplete lineage sorting. Work on reconciling gene
tree with species phylogenies under two or more of these events have also begun
to emerge. Our group recently devised both parsimony and probabilistic
frameworks for reconciling a gene tree with a phylogenetic network, thus
allowing for the detection of hybridization in the presence of incomplete
lineage sorting. While the frameworks were general and could handle any
topology, they are computationally intensive, rendering their application to
large datasets infeasible. In this paper, we present two novel approaches to
address the computational challenges of the two frameworks that are based on
the concept of ancestral configurations. Our approaches still compute exact
solutions while improving the computational time by up to five orders of
magnitude. These substantial gains in speed scale the applicability of these
unified reconciliation frameworks to much larger data sets. We discuss how the
topological features of the gene tree and phylogenetic network may affect the
performance of the new algorithms. We have implemented the algorithms in our
PhyloNet software package, which is publicly available in open source.
