We consider embedded ring-type surfaces (that is, compact, connected,
orientable surfaces with two boundary components and Euler-Poincar\'{e}
characteristic zero) in ${\bold R}^3$ of constant mean curvature which meet
planes $\Pi_1$ and $\Pi_2$ in constant contact angles $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_2$ and bound, together with those planes, an open set in ${\bold
R}^3$. If the planes are parallel, then it is known that any contact angles
may be realized by infinitely many such surfaces given explicitly in terms of
elliptic integrals. If $\Pi_1$ meets $\Pi_2$ in an angle $\alpha$ and if
$\gamma_1+\gamma_2>\pi+\alpha$, then portions of spheres provide (explicit)
solutions. In the present work it is shown that if
$\gamma_1+\gamma_2\le\pi+\alpha$, then the problem admits no solution. The
result contrasts with recent work of H.C.~Wente who constructed, in the
particular case $\gamma_1 = \gamma_2 =\pi/2$, a {\it self-intersecting}
surface spanning a wedge as described above.
  Our proof is based on an extension of the Alexandrov planar reflection
procedure to a reflection about spheres, on the intrinsic geometry of the
surface, and on a new maximum principle related to surface geometry. The
method should be of interest also in connection with other problems arising in
the global differential geometry of surfaces.
