This paper further develops the theory of arbitrary semigroups acting on
trees via elliptic mappings. A key tool is the Lyndon-Chiswell length function
L for the semigroup S which allows one to construct a tree T and an action of S
on T via elliptic maps. Improving on previous results, the length function of
the action will also be L.
