We introduce new objects, the interval-posets, that encode intervals of the
Tamari lattice. We then find a combinatorial interpretation of the bilinear
form that appears in the functional equation of Tamari intervals described by
Chapoton. Thus, we retrieve this functional equation and prove that the
polynomial recursively computed from the bilinear form on each tree $T$ counts
the number of trees smaller than $T$ in the Tamari order.
