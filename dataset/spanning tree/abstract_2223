We obtain tree-level unitarity constraints for the Two Higgs Doublet Model
(2HDM) with explicit CP-violation. We limit ourselves to the case with soft
violation of the discrete Z_2 symmetry of theory. The key role is played by the
rephasing invariance of the 2HDM lagrangian. Our simple approach for derivation
of these constraints can be easily transferred to other forms of Higgs sector.
We briefly discuss correspondence between possible violation of tree level
unitarity limitation and physical content of theory.
