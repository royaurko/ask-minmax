Jet substructure is typically studied using clustering algorithms, such as
kT, which arrange the jets' constituents into trees. Instead of considering a
single tree per jet, we propose that multiple trees should be considered,
weighted by an appropriate metric. Then each jet in each event produces a
distribution for an observable, rather than a single value. Advantages of this
approach include: 1) observables have significantly increased statistical
stability; and, 2) new observables, such as the variance of the distribution,
provide new handles for signal and background discrimination. For example, we
find that employing a set of trees substantially reduces the observed
fluctuations in the pruned mass distribution, enhancing the likelihood of new
particle discovery for a given integrated luminosity. Furthermore, the
resulting pruned mass distributions for (background) QCD jets are found to be
substantially wider than that for (signal) jets with intrinsic mass scales,
e.g. jets containing a W decay. A cut on this width yields a substantial
enhancement in significance relative to a cut on the standard pruned jet mass
alone. In particular the luminosity needed for a given significance requirement
decreases by a factor of two relative to standard pruning.
