We introduce the notion of a restricted exchangeable partition of
$\mathbb{N}$. We obtain integral representations, consider associated
fragmentations, embeddings into continuum random trees and convergence to such
limit trees. In particular, we deduce from the general theory developed here a
limit result conjectured previously for Ford's alpha model and its extension,
the alpha-gamma model, where restricted exchangeability arises naturally.
