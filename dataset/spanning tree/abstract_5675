We propose a simple scenario for baryogenesis in supersymmetric models where
baryon number is broken alongwith R-parity. The lightest supersymmetric
particle (neutralino) decays to three quarks and $CP-$ violation comes from
interference of tree and one loop box diagrams. The bounds on the $R-$parity
breaking couplings from the out-of-equilibrium condition are considerably
relaxed in this scenario.
