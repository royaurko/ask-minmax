In this paper we construct Riemannian metrics and weight functions over
Casson handles. We show that the corresponding Atiyah-Hitchin-Singer complexes
are Fredholm for some class of Casson handles of bounded type. Using these, the
Yang-Mills moduli spaces are constructed as finite dimensional smooth manifolds
over Casson handles in the class.
