Heydari \cite{heydari2013} presented very nice formulae for the Wiener and
terminal Wiener indices of generalized Bethe trees. It is pity that there are
some errors for the formulae. In this paper, we correct these errors and
characterize all trees with the minimum terminal Wiener index among all the
trees of order $n$ and with maximum degree $\Delta$.
