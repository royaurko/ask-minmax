The evolving Kingman coalescent is the tree-valued process which records the
time changes undergone by the genealogies of Moran populations. We consider the
associated process of total external tree length of the evolving Kingman
coalescent and its asymptotic behaviour when the number of leaves of the tree
tends to infinity. We show that on the time scale of the Moran model slowed
down by a factor equal to the population size, the (centred and rescaled)
external length process converges to a stationary Gaussian process with almost
surely continuous paths and covariance function $c(s,t)=\Big( \frac 2 {2+|s-t|}
\Big)^2$. A key role in the evolution of the external length is played by the
internal lengths of finite orders in the coalescent at a fixed time which
behave asymptotically in a multivariate Gaussian manner (see Dahmer and
Kersting (2013)). A natural coupling of the Moran model to a critical branching
process is used.
