In this report we describe a parallel implementation of a Tree-SPH code
realized using the SHMEM libraries in the Cray T3E supercomputer at CINECA. We
show the result of a 3D test to check the code performances against its scalar
version. Finally we compare the load balancing and scalability of the code with
PTreeSPH (Dav\'e et al 1997), the only other parallel Tree-SPH code present in
the literature.
