We deal with several pcf problems; we characterize another version of
exponentiation: number of kappa-branches in a tree with lambda nodes, deal
with existence of independent sets in stable theories, possible cardinality of
ultraproduct, the depth of ultraproducts of Boolean Algebras. Also we give
cardinal invariant for each lambda with pcf restriction and investigate
further T_D(f) .
