Spatially explicit data layers of tree species assemblages, referred to as
forest types or forest type groups, are a key component in large-scale
assessments of forest sustainability, biodiversity, timber biomass, carbon
sinks and forest health monitoring. This paper explores the utility of coupling
georeferenced national forest inventory (NFI) data with readily available and
spatially complete environmental predictor variables through spatially-varying
multinomial logistic regression models to predict forest type groups across
large forested landscapes. These models exploit underlying spatial associations
within the NFI plot array and the spatially-varying impact of predictor
variables to improve the accuracy of forest type group predictions. The
richness of these models incurs onerous computational burdens and we discuss
dimension reducing spatial processes that retain the richness in modeling. We
illustrate using NFI data from Michigan, USA, where we provide a comprehensive
analysis of this large study area and demonstrate improved prediction with
associated measures of uncertainty.
