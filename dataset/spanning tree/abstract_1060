We investigate tree-automatic well-founded trees. Using Delhomme's
decomposition technique for tree-automatic structures, we show that the
(ordinal) rank of a tree-automatic well-founded tree is strictly below
omega^omega. Moreover, we make a step towards proving that the ranks of
tree-automatic well-founded partial orders are bounded by omega^omega^omega: we
prove this bound for what we call upwards linear partial orders. As an
application of our result, we show that the isomorphism problem for
tree-automatic well-founded trees is complete for level Delta^0_{omega^omega}
of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy with respect to Turing-reductions.
