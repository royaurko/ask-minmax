We describe a completely algebraic axiom system for intertwining operators of
vertex algebra modules, using algebraic flat connections, thus formulating the
concept of a {\em tree algebra}. Using the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, we
further prove that a vertex tensor category in the sense of Huang and Lepowsky
gives rise to a tree algebra over $\C$. We also show that the chiral WZW model
of a simply connected simple compact Lie group gives rise to a tree algebra
over $\Q$.
