We describe a general approach of determining the distribution of spanning
subgraphs in the random graph $\G(n,p)$. In particular, we determine the
distribution of spanning subgraphs of certain given degree sequences, which is
a generalisation of the $d$-factors, of spanning triangle-free subgraphs, of
(directed) Hamilton cycles and of spanning subgraphs that are isomorphic to a
collection of vertex disjoint (directed) triangles.
