We extend the Operator Product Expansion for Null Polygon Wilson loops to the
Mason-Skinner-Caron-Huot super loop, dual to non MHV gluon amplitudes. We
explain how the known tree level amplitudes can be promoted into an infinite
amount of data at any loop order in the OPE picture. As an application, we
re-derive all one loop NMHV six gluon amplitudes by promoting their tree level
expressions. We also present some new all loops predictions for these
amplitudes.
