An Adaptive Mesh in Phase Space (AMPS) methodology has been developed for
solving multi-dimensional kinetic equations by the discrete velocity method. A
Cartesian mesh for both configuration (r) and velocity (v) spaces is produced
using a tree of trees data structure. The mesh in r-space is automatically
generated around embedded boundaries and dynamically adapted to local solution
properties. The mesh in v-space is created on-the-fly for each cell in r-space.
Mappings between neighboring v-space trees implemented for the advection
operator in configuration space. We have developed new algorithms for solving
the full Boltzmann and linear Boltzmann equations with AMPS. Several recent
innovations were used to calculate the discrete Boltzmann collision integral
with dynamically adaptive mesh in velocity space: importance sampling,
multi-point projection method, and the variance reduction method. We have
developed an efficient algorithm for calculating the linear Boltzmann collision
integral for elastic and inelastic collisions in a Lorentz gas. New AMPS
technique has been demonstrated for simulations of hypersonic rarefied gas
flows, ion and electron kinetics in weakly ionized plasma, radiation and light
particle transport through thin films, and electron streaming in
semiconductors. We have shown that AMPS allows minimizing the number of cells
in phase space to reduce computational cost and memory usage for solving
challenging kinetic problems.
