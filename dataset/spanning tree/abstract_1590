A tree is called double starlike if it has exactly two vertices of degree
greater than two. Let $H(p,n,q)$ denote the double starlike tree obtained by
attaching $p$ pendant vertices to one pendant vertex of the path $P_n$ and $q$
pendant vertices to the other pendant vertex of $P_n$. In this paper, we prove
that $H(p,n,q)$ is determined by its Laplacian spectrum.
