We define the \emph{curvilinear rank} of a degree $d$ form $P$ in $n+1$
variables as the minimum length of a curvilinear scheme, contained in the
$d$-th Veronese embedding of $\mathbb{P}^n$, whose span contains the projective
class of $P$. Then, we give a bound for rank of any homogenous polynomial, in
dependance on its curvilinear rank.
