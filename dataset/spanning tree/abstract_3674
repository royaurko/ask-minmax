Given a tree T on v vertices and an integer k exceeding one. One can define
the k-expansion T^k as a k-uniform linear hypergraph by enlarging each edge
with a new, distinct set of (k-2) vertices. Then T^k has v+ (v-1)(k-2)
vertices. The aim of this paper is to show that using the delta-system method
one can easily determine asymptotically the size of the largest T^k-free
n-vertex hypergraph, i.e., the Turan number of T^k.
