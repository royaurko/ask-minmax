In this paper we consider two attractive stochastic spatial models in which
each site can be in state 0, 1, or 2: Krone's model in which 0 = vacant, 1 =
juvenile, and 2 = a mature individual capable of giving birth, and the
Staver-Levin foresst model in which 0 = grass, 1 = sapling, and 2 = tree. Our
first result shows that if (0,0) is an unstable fixed point of the mean-field
ODE for densities of 1's and 2's then when the range of interaction is large,
there is positive probability of survival starting from a finite set and a
stationary distribution in which all three types are present. The result we
obtain in this way is asymptotically sharp for Krone's model. However, in the
Staver-Levin forest model, if $(0,0)$ is attracting then there may also be
another stable fixed point for the ODE, and in some of these cases there is a
nontrivial stationary distribution.
