The large supercluster structures obvious in recent galaxy redshift surveys
are quantified using an one-dimensional cluster analysis (core sampling) and a
three-dimensional cluster analysis based on the minimal spanning tree. The
comparison with the LCRS reveals promising stable results. At a mean
overdensity of about ten, the supercluster systems form huge wall-like
structures comprising about 40% of all galaxies. The overdense clusters have a
low mean transverse velocity dispersion of about 400 km/s, i.e. they look quite
narrow in redshift space. We performed N-body simulations with large box sizes
for six cosmological scenarios. The quantitative analysis shows that the
observed structures can be understood best in low density models with $\Omega_m
\le 0.5$ with or without a cosmological constant.
