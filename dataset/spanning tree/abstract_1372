In this paper, we study cellular automata on Cayley tree of order 2 over the
field $\mathbb Z_p$ (the set of prime numbers modulo $p$). We construct the
rule matrix corresponding to finite cellular automata on Cayley tree. Further,
we analyze the reversibility problem of this cellular automata for some given
values of $a,b,c,d\in \mathbb{Z}_{p}\setminus {0}$ and the levels $n$ of Cayley
tree. We compute the measure-theoretical entropy of the cellular automata which
we define on Cayley tree.
