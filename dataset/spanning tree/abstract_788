The survey methodological paper addresses a glance to a general decision
support platform technology for modular systems (modular/composite
alterantives/solutions) in various applied domains. The decision support
platform consists of seven basic combinatorial engineering frameworks (system
synthesis, system modeling, evaluation, detection of bottleneck,
improvement/extension, multistage design, combinatorial evolution and
forecasting). The decision support platform is based on decision support
procedures (e.g., multicriteria selection/sorting, clustering), combinatorial
optimization problems (e.g., knapsack, multiple choice problem, clique,
assignment/allocation, covering, spanning trees), and their combinations. The
following is described: (1) general scheme of the decision support platform
technology; (2) brief descriptions of modular (composite) systems (or composite
alternatives); (3) trends in moving from chocie/selection of alternatives to
processing of composite alternatives which correspond to hierarchical modular
products/systems; (4) scheme of resource requirements (i.e., human,
information-computer); and (5) basic combinatorial engineering frameworks and
their applications in various domains.
