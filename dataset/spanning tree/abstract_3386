The mean first passage time (MFPT) for photoexcitations diffusion in a
funneling potential of artificial tree-like light-harvesting antennae
(phenylacetylene dendrimers with generation-dependent segment lengths) is
computed. Effects of the non-linearity of the realistic funneling potential and
slow random solvent fluctuations considerably slow down the center-bound
diffusion beyond a temperature-dependent optimal size. Diffusion on a
disordered Cayley tree with a linear potential is investigated analytically. At
low temperatures we predict a phase in which the MFPT is dominated by a few
paths.
