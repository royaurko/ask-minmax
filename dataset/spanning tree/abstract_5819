We present a novel technique to remove spurious ambiguity from transition
systems for dependency parsing. Our technique chooses a canonical sequence of
transition operations (computation) for a given dependency tree. Our technique
can be applied to a large class of bottom-up transition systems, including for
instance Nivre (2004) and Attardi (2006).
