We describe the (minimal) tree-graded structure of asymptotic cones of
non-geometric graph manifold groups, and as a consequence we show that all said
asymptotic cones are bilipschitz equivalent. Combining this with geometrization
and other known results we obtain that all asymptotic cones of a given
3-manifold group are bilipschitz equivalent.
