We consider high energy scattering of open superstrings in flat spacetime. It
is shown that in this regime amplitudes are dominated by minimal supersurfaces
spanned by lightlike supercontours built of the on-shell momenta. We
demonstrate how using a generalization of the functional over
reparametrizations of the boundary one can extract the area of the minimal
supersurfaces directly from the lightlike contour. Exponent of the area
correctly reproduces RNS amplitudes. We also comment on possible implementation
of the supercontours to Wilson loops/Scattering amplitudes duality.
