It is found that there exists an empirical linear relation between the high
frequency $\nhigh$ and low frequency $\nlow$ of quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) for black hole candidate (BHC), neutron star (NS) and white dwarf (WD)
in the binary systems, which spans five orders of magnitude in frequency.
  For the NS Z (Atoll) sources,
  $\nu_{high}$ and $\nu_{low}$ are identified as the lower kHz QPO frequency
and horizontal branch oscillations (HBOs) $\nh$ (broad noise components); for
the black hole candidates and low-luminosity neutron stars, they are the QPOs
and broad noise components at frequencies between 1 and 10 Hz; for WDs, they
are the ``dwarf nova oscillations'' (DNOs) and QPOs of cataclysmic variables
(CVs). To interpret this relation, our model ascribes $\nu_{high}$ to the
Alfv\'en wave oscillation frequency at a preferred radius and $\nu_{low}$ to
the same mechanism at another radius. Then, we can obtain $\nlow = 0.08
  \nhigh$ and the relation between the upper kHz QPO frequency $\nt$ and HBO to
be $\nh \simeq 56 ({\rm Hz}) (\nt/{\rm kHz})^{2}$, which are in accordance with
the observed empirical relations. Furthermore, some implications of model are
discussed, including why QPO frequencies of white dwarfs and neutron stars span
five orders of magnitude in frequency. \\
