Multi-stage financial decision optimization under uncertainty depends on a
careful numerical approximation of the underlying stochastic process, which
describes the future returns of the selected assets or asset categories.
Various approaches towards an optimal generation of discrete-time,
discrete-state approximations (represented as scenario trees) have been
suggested in the literature. In this paper, a new evolutionary algorithm to
create scenario trees for multi-stage financial optimization models will be
presented. Numerical results and implementation details conclude the paper.
