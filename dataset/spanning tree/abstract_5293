Using new and published photometric observations of mu1 Sco (HR 6247),
spanning 70 years, a period of 1.4462700(5) days was determined. It was found
that the epoch of primary minimum suggested by Shobbrook at HJD 2449534.178
requires an adjustment to HJD 2449534.17700(9) to align all the available
photometric datasets. Using the resulting combined-data light-curve, radial
velocities derived from IUE data and the modelling software PHOEBE, a new
system solution for this binary was obtained. It appears that the secondary is
close to, or just filling, its Roche-lobe.
