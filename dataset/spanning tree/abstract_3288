The paper elucidates the physical basis of experimental results on
superluminal signal velocity. It will be made plausible that superluminal
signals do not violate the principle of causality but they can shorten the
luminal vacuum time span between cause and effect. This amazing behaviour is
based on the property that any physical signal has a finite duration.
