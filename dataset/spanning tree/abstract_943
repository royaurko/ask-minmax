We investigate the reflexive sheaves on $\PP^3$ spanned in codimension 2 with
very low first Chern class $c_1$. We also give the sufficient and necessary
conditions on numeric data of such sheaves for indecomposabiity. As a
by-product we obtain that every reflexive sheaf on $\PP^3$ spanned in
codimension 2 with $c_1=2$ is spanned.
