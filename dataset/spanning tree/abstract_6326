In this paper we study the adjoint functors between the category of
Rota-Baxter algebras and the categories of dendriform dialgebras and
trialgebras. In analogy to the well-known theory of the adjoint functor between
the category of associative algebras and Lie algebras, we first give an
explicit construction of free Rota-Baxter algebras and then apply it to obtain
universal enveloping Rota-Baxter algebras of dendriform dialgebras and
trialgebras. We further show that free dendriform dialgebras and trialgebras,
as represented by binary planar trees and planar trees, are canonical
subalgebras of free Rota-Baxter algebras.
