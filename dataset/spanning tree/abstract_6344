Modern approaches to the search of Relative and Global minima of potential
energy function of Biomacromolecular structures include techniques of
combinatorial optimization like the study of Steiner Points and Steiner Trees.
These methods have been successfully applied to the problem of modelling the
configurations of the average atomic positions when they are disposed in the
usual sequence of evenly spaced points along right circular helices. In the
present contribution, we intend to show how these methods can be adapted for
explaining the advantages of introducing the concept of a Steiner Ratio
Function (SRF). We also show how this new concept is adequate for fitting the
results obtained by computing experiments and for providing an improvement to
these results if we use the restriction of working with Full Steiner Trees.
