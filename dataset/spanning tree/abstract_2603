We analyze a simple model for growing tree networks and find that although it
never percolates, there is an anomalously large cluster at finite size. We
study the growth of both the maximal cluster and the cluster containing the
original vertex and find that they obey power laws. This property is also
observed through simulations in a non-linear model with loops and a true
percolating phase.
