This paper provides answers to questions regarding the almost sure limiting
behavior of rooted, binary tree-structured rules for regression. Examples show
that questions raised by Gordon and Olshen in 1984 have negative answers. For
these examples of regression functions and sequences of their associated binary
tree-structured approximations, for all regression functions except those in a
set of the first category, almost sure consistency fails dramatically on events
of full probability. One consequence is that almost sure consistency of binary
tree-structured rules such as CART requires conditions beyond requiring that
(1) the regression function be in ${\mathcal {L}}^1$, (2) partitions of a
Euclidean feature space be into polytopes with sides parallel to coordinate
axes, (3) the mesh of the partitions becomes arbitrarily fine almost surely and
(4) the empirical learning sample content of each polytope be ``large enough.''
The material in this paper includes the solution to a problem raised by Dudley
in discussions. The main results have a corollary regarding the lack of almost
sure consistency of certain Bayes-risk consistent rules for classification.
