Recently Kubica et al. (Inf. Process. Let., 2013) and Kim et al. (submitted
to Theor. Comp. Sci.) introduced order-preserving pattern matching. In this
problem we are looking for consecutive substrings of the text that have the
same "shape" as a given pattern. These results include a linear-time
order-preserving pattern matching algorithm for polynomially-bounded alphabet
and an extension of this result to pattern matching with multiple patterns. We
make one step forward in the analysis and give an
$O(\frac{n\log{n}}{\log\log{n}})$ time randomized algorithm constructing suffix
trees in the order-preserving setting. We show a number of applications of
order-preserving suffix trees to identify patterns and repetitions in time
series.
