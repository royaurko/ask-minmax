We present measurements of current noise and cross-correlations in
three-terminal Superconductor-Normal metal-Superconductor (S-N-S)
nanostructures that are potential solid-state entanglers thanks to Andreev
reflections at the N-S interfaces. The noise correlation measurements spanned
from the regime where electron-electron interactions are relevant to the regime
of Incoherent Multiple Andreev Reflection (IMAR). In the latter regime,
negative cross-correlations are observed in samples with closely-spaced
junctions.
