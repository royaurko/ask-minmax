We provide decidability and undecidability results on the model-checking
problem for infinite tree structures. These tree structures are built from
sequences of elements of infinite relational structures. More precisely, we
deal with the tree iteration of a relational structure M in the sense of
Shelah-Stupp. In contrast to classical results where model-checking is shown
decidable for MSO-logic, we show decidability of the tree model-checking
problem for logics that allow only path quantifiers and chain quantifiers
(where chains are subsets of paths), as they appear in branching time logics;
however, at the same time the tree is enriched by the equal-level relation
(which holds between vertices u, v if they are on the same tree level). We
separate cleanly the tree logic from the logic used for expressing properties
of the underlying structure M. We illustrate the scope of the decidability
results by showing that two slight extensions of the framework lead to
undecidability. In particular, this applies to the (stronger) tree iteration in
the sense of Muchnik-Walukiewicz.
