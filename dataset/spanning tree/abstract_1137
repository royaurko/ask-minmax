We propose a novel approach for studying rooted trees by using functions that
we will call descent functions. We provide a construction method for rooted
trees that allows to study their properties through the use of descent
functions. Moreover, in this way, we are able to compose rooted trees with each
other. Such a new composition of rooted trees is a very powerful tool applied
in this paper in order to obtain important results as the creation of new
rational and Pythagorean trees.
