The mean-field dynamics of a collection of stochastic agents with local
versus nonlocal interactions is studied via analytically soluble models. The
nonlocal interactions result from a barycentric modulation of the observation
range of the agents. Our modeling framework is based on a discrete two-velocity
Boltzmann dynamics which can be analytically discussed. Depending on the span
and the modulation of the interaction range, we analytically observe a
transition from a purely diffusive regime without definite pattern to a
flocking evolution represented by a solitary wave traveling with constant
velocity.
