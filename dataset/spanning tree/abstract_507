We evaluate the radiative decay into a pseudoscalar meson and a photon of the
whole set of the axial-vector mesons dynamically generated from the
vector-pseudoscalar meson ($VP$) interaction. We take into account tree level
and loop diagrams coming from the axial-vector decay into a vector and a
pseudoscalar meson. We find a large span for the values of the radiative widths
of the different axial-vector mesons. In particular, we evaluate the radiative
decay into $K \gamma$ of the two $K_1(1270)$ states, recently claimed
theoretically, and discuss the experimental values quoted so far on the
assumption of only one state.
