We show how to construct certain homogeneous deformations for rational normal
varieties with codimension one torus action. This can then be used to construct
homogeneous deformations of any toric variety in arbitrary degree. For locally
trivial deformations coming from this construction, we calculate the image of
the Kodaira-Spencer map. We then show that for a smooth complete toric variety,
our homogeneous deformations span the space of first-order deformations.
