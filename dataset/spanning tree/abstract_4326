A wireless sensor network has a wide application domain which is expanding
everyday and they have been deployed pertaining to their application area. An
application independent approach is yet to come to terms with the ongoing
exploitation of the WSNs. In this paper we propose a decentralized lifetime
maximizing tree for application independent data aggregation scheme using the
clustering for data delivery in WSNs. The proposed tree will minimize the
energy consumption which has been a resisting factor in the smooth working of
WSNs as well as minimize the distance between the communicating nodes under the
control of a sub-sink which further communicate and transfer data to the sink
node.
