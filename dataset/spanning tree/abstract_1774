Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) is a common source of gene tree incongruence
in multilocus analyses. A large number of methods have been developed to infer
species trees in the presence of ILS. Here we provide a mathematical analysis
of several coalescent-based methods. Our analysis is performed on a three-taxon
species tree and assumes that the gene trees are correctly reconstructed along
with their branch lengths.
