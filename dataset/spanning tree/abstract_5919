In this paper we determine all locally finite and symmetric actions of a
group on the tree of valency five. As a corollary we complete the
classification of the isomorphism types of vertex and edge stabilisers in a
group acting symmetrically on a graph of valency five. This builds on work of
Weiss and recent work of Zhou and Feng. This depends upon the second result of
this paper, the classification of isomorphism types of finite, primitive
amalgams of degree (5, 2).
