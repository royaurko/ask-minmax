Dual-tree wavelet decompositions have recently gained much popularity, mainly
due to their ability to provide an accurate directional analysis of images
combined with a reduced redundancy. When the decomposition of a random process
is performed -- which occurs in particular when an additive noise is corrupting
the signal to be analyzed -- it is useful to characterize the statistical
properties of the dual-tree wavelet coefficients of this process. As dual-tree
decompositions constitute overcomplete frame expansions, correlation structures
are introduced among the coefficients, even when a white noise is analyzed. In
this paper, we show that it is possible to provide an accurate description of
the covariance properties of the dual-tree coefficients of a wide-sense
stationary process. The expressions of the (cross-)covariance sequences of the
coefficients are derived in the one and two-dimensional cases. Asymptotic
results are also provided, allowing to predict the behaviour of the
second-order moments for large lag values or at coarse resolution. In addition,
the cross-correlations between the primal and dual wavelets, which play a
primary role in our theoretical analysis, are calculated for a number of
classical wavelet families. Simulation results are finally provided to validate
these results.
