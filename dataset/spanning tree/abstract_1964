Recently, greedy algorithm has received much attention as a cost-effective
means to reconstruct the sparse signals from compressed measurements. Much of
previous work has focused on the investigation of a single candidate to
identify the support (index set of nonzero elements) of the sparse signals.
Well-known drawback of the greedy approach is that the chosen candidate is
often not the optimal solution due to the myopic decision in each iteration. In
this paper, we propose a greedy sparse recovery algorithm investigating
multiple promising candidates via the tree search. Two key ingredients of the
proposed algorithm, referred to as the matching pursuit with a tree pruning
(TMP), to achieve efficiency in the tree search are the {\it pre-selection} to
put a restriction on columns of the sensing matrix to be investigated and the
{\it tree pruning} to eliminate unpromising paths from the search tree. In our
performance guarantee analysis and empirical simulations, we show that TMP is
effective in recovering sparse signals in both noiseless and noisy scenarios.
