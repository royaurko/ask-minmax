We consider questions related to the existence of spanning trees in graphs
with the property that after the removal of any path in the tree the graph
remains connected. We show that, for planar graphs, the existence of trees with
this property is closely related to the Hamiltonicity of the graph. For graphs
with a 1- or 2-vertex cut, the Hamiltonicity also plays a central role. We also
deal with spanning trees satisfying this property restricted to paths arising
from fundamental cycles. The cycle space of a graph can be generated by the
fundamental cycles of any spanning tree, and Tutte showed, that for a
3-connected graph, it can be generated by nonseparating cycles. We are also
interested in the existence of a fundamental basis consisting of nonseparating
cycles.
