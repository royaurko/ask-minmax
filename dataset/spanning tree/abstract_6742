We present the calculation of the most important electroweak corrections to
dijet production at the LHC and the Tevatron, comprising tree-level effects of
O(\alpha_s\alpha,\alpha^2) and weak loop corrections of O(\alpha_s^2\alpha).
Although negligible for integrated cross sections, these corrections can reach
10-20% in the TeV range for transverse jet momenta k_T. Our detailed discussion
of numerical results comprises distributions in the dijet invariant mass and in
the transverse momenta of the leading and subleading jets. We find that the
weak loop corrections amount to about -12% and -10% for leading jets with
k_T~3TeV at the 14TeV LHC and k_T~800GeV at the Tevatron, respectively. The
electroweak tree-level contributions are of the same generic size and typically
positive at the LHC and negative at the Tevatron at high energy scales.
Generally the corrections to the dijet invariant mass distributions are smaller
by at least a factor of two as compared to the corresponding reach in the k_T
distributions, because unlike the k_T spectra the invariant-mass distributions
are not dominated by the Sudakov regime at high energy scales.
