The ACT-R theory of cognition developed by John Anderson and colleagues
endeavors to explain how humans recall chunks of information and how they solve
problems. ACT-R also serves as a theoretical basis for "cognitive tutors",
i.e., automatic tutoring systems that help students learn mathematics, computer
programming, and other subjects. The official ACT-R definition is distributed
across a large body of literature spanning many articles and monographs, and
hence it is difficult for an "outsider" to learn the most important aspects of
the theory. This paper aims to provide a tutorial to the core components of the
ACT-R theory.
