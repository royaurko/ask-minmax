The fragmentation of production across countries has become an important
feature of the globalization in recent decades and is often conceptualized by
the term, global value chains (GVCs). When empirically investigating the GVCs,
previous studies are mainly interested in knowing how global the GVCs are
rather than how the GVCs look like. From a complex networks perspective, we use
the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) to study the global production system.
We find that the industry-level GVCs are indeed not chain-like but are better
characterized by the tree topology. Hence, we compute the global value trees
(GVTs) for all the industries available in the WIOD. Moreover, we compute an
industry importance measure based on the GVTs and compare it with other network
centrality measures. Finally, we discuss some future applications of the GVTs.
