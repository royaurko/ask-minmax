While it was defined long ago, the extension of CTL with quantification over
atomic propositions has never been studied extensively. Considering two
different semantics (depending whether propositional quantification refers to
the Kripke structure or to its unwinding tree), we study its expressiveness
(showing in particular that QCTL coincides with Monadic Second-Order Logic for
both semantics) and characterise the complexity of its model-checking and
satisfiability problems, depending on the number of nested propositional
quantifiers (showing that the structure semantics populates the polynomial
hierarchy while the tree semantics populates the exponential hierarchy).
