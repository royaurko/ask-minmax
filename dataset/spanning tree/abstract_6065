We carry out a time-series analysis of the combined data from three
experiments measuring the cosmic muon flux at the Gran Sasso laboratory, at a
depth of 3800 m.w.e. These data, taken by the MACRO, LVD and Borexino
experiments, span a period of over 20 years, and correspond to muons with a
threshold energy, at sea level, of around 1.3 TeV. We compare the best-fit
period and phase of the full muon data set with the combined DAMA/NaI and
DAMA/LIBRA data, which spans the same time period, as a test of the hypothesis
that the cosmic ray muon flux is responsible for the annual modulation detected
by DAMA. We find in the muon data a large-amplitude fluctuation with a period
of around one year, and a phase that is incompatible with that of the DAMA
modulation at 5.2 sigmas. Aside from this annual variation, the muon data also
contains a further significant modulation with a period between 10 and 11 years
and a power well above the 99.9% C.L threshold for noise, whose phase
corresponds well with the solar cycle: a surprising observation for such high
energy muons. We see no corresponding long-period oscillation in the
stratospheric temperature data.
