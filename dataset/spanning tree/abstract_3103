An $r$-augmented tree is a rooted tree plus $r$ edges added from each leaf to
ancestors. For $d,g,r\in\mathbb{N}$, we construct a bipartite $r$-augmented
complete $d$-ary tree having girth at least $g$. The height of such trees must
grow extremely rapidly in terms of the girth.
  Using the resulting graphs, we construct sparse non-$k$-choosable bipartite
graphs, showing that maximum average degree at most $2(k-1)$ is a sharp
sufficient condition for $k$-choosability in bipartite graphs, even when
requiring large girth. We also give a new simple construction of
non-$k$-colorable graphs and hypergraphs with any girth $g$.
