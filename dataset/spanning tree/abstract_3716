We construct tree-decompositions of graphs that distinguish all their
k-blocks and tangles of order k, for any fixed integer k. We describe a family
of algorithms to construct such decompositions, seeking to maximize their
diversity subject to the requirement that they commute with graph isomorphisms.
In particular, all the decompositions constructed are invariant under the
automorphisms of the graph.
