Arden's Lemma is a classical result in language theory allowing the
computation of a rational expression denoting the language recognized by a
finite string automaton. In this paper we generalize this important lemma to
the rational tree languages. Moreover, we propose also a construction of a
rational tree expression which denotes the accepted tree language of a finite
tree automaton.
