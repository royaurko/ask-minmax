Using the method of spectral decimation and a modified version of Kirchhoffs
Matrix-Tree Theorem, a closed form solution to the number of spanning trees on
approximating graphs to a fully symmetric self-similar structure on a finitely
ramified fractal is given in Theorem (3.4). Examples calculated include the
Sierpinski Gasket, a non p.c.f. analog of the Sierpinski Gasket, the Diamond
fractal, and the Hexagasket. For each example, the asymptotic complexity
constant is found. Dropping the fully symmetry assumption, it is shown that the
limsup and liminf of the asymptotic complexity constant exist.
