We prove that the contact graph of a 2-dimensional CAT(0) cube complex ${\bf
X}$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be coloured with at most
$\epsilon(\Delta)=M\Delta^{26}$ colours, for a fixed constant $M$. This implies
that ${\bf X}$ (and the associated median graph) isometrically embeds in the
Cartesian product of at most $\epsilon(\Delta)$ trees, and that the event
structure whose domain is ${\bf X}$ admits a nice labeling with
$\epsilon(\Delta)$ labels. On the other hand, we present an example of a
5-dimensional CAT(0) cube complex with uniformly bounded degrees of 0-cubes
which cannot be embedded into a Cartesian product of a finite number of trees.
This answers in the negative a question raised independently by F. Haglund, G.
Niblo, M. Sageev, and the first contributor of this paper.
