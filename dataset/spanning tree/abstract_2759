We give a brief introduction to the clocked lambda calculus, an extension of
the classical lambda calculus with a unary symbol tau used to witness the
beta-steps. In contrast to the classical lambda calculus, this extension is
infinitary strongly normalising and infinitary confluent. The infinitary normal
forms are enriched Boehm Trees, which we call clocked Boehm Trees.
