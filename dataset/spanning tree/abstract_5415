Let Y be a Calabi-Yau complete intersection in a weighted projective space.
We show that the space of quadratic invariants of the hypergeometric group
associated with the twisted I-function is one-dimensional, and spanned by the
Gram matrix of a split-generator of the derived category of coherent sheaves on
Y with respect to the Euler form.
