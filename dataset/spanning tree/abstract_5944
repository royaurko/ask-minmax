Treewidth is a graph parameter of fundamental importance to algorithmic and
structural graph theory. This paper describes several graph parameters tied to
treewidth, including separation number, tangle number, well-linked number and
cartesian tree product number. We prove that these parameters are tied to
treewidth. In a number of cases we also improve known bounds, provide simpler
proofs and show that the inequalities presented are tight.
