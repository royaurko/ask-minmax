We investigate several approaches for constructing Monte Carlo realizations
of the merging history of virialized dark matter halos (``merger trees'') using
the extended Press-Schechter formalism. We describe several unsuccessful
methods in order to illustrate some of the difficult aspects of this problem.
We develop a practical method that leads to the reconstruction of mean
quantities such as the conditional and overall mass functions as given by the
Press-Schechter model. This method is convenient, computationally efficient,
and works for any power spectrum or background cosmology. In addition, we
investigate statistics that describe the distribution of the number of
progenitors and their masses as a function of redshift.
