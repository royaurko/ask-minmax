We determine the parameter c_SW required for O(a)-improvement of the three
flavor Wilson fermion action together with the tree-level Symanzik improved
gauge action. The standard improvement condition is employed for a range of
couplings. Additionally, we perform a check of the volume independence of c_SW
and provide a preliminary estimate of the lattice spacing at our largest values
of g_0^2.
