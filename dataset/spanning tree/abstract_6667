The stability number of a graph G, denoted by alpha(G), is the cardinality of
a maximum stable set, and mu(G) is the cardinality of a maximum matching in G.
If alpha(G)+mu(G) equals its order, then G is a Konig-Egervary graph.
  In this paper we deal with square-stable graphs, i.e., the graphs G enjoying
the equality alpha(G)=alpha(G^{2}), where G^{2} denotes the second power of G.
In particular, we show that a Konig-Egervary graph is square-stable if and only
if it has a perfect matching consisting of pendant edges, and in consequence,
we deduce that well-covered trees are exactly the square-stable trees.
