Stein's method is a powerful technique for proving central limit theorems in
probability theory when more straightforward approaches cannot be implemented
easily. This article begins with a survey of the historical development of
Stein's method and some recent advances. This is followed by a description of a
"general purpose" variant of Stein's method that may be called the generalized
perturbative approach, and an application of this method to minimal spanning
trees. The article concludes with the descriptions of some well known open
problems that may possibly be solved by the perturbative approach or some other
variant of Stein's method.
