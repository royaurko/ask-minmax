We present a simple formalism for the evolution of timelike jets in which
tree-level matrix element corrections can be systematically incorporated, up to
arbitrary parton multiplicities and over all of phase space, in a way that
exponentiates the matching corrections. The scheme is cast as a shower Markov
chain which generates one single unweighted event sample, that can be passed to
standard hadronization models. Remaining perturbative uncertainties are
estimated by providing several alternative weight sets for the same events, at
a relatively modest additional overhead. As an explicit example, we consider Z
-> q qbar evolution with unpolarized, massless quarks and include several
formally subleading improvements as well as matching to tree-level matrix
elements through alpha_s^4. The resulting algorithm is implemented in the
publicly available VINCIA plugin to the PYTHIA 8 event generator.
