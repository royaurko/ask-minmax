One of the most useful tools for studying the geometry of the mapping class
group has been the subsurface projections of Masur and Minsky. Here we propose
an analogue for the study of the geometry of Out(F_n) called submanifold
projection. We use the doubled handlebody M_n = #^n S^2 \times S^1 as a
geometric model of F_n, and consider essential embedded 2-spheres in M_n,
isotopy classes of which can be identified with free splittings of the free
group. We interpret submanifold projection in the context of the sphere complex
(also known as the splitting complex). We prove that submanifold projection
satisfies a number of desirable properties, including a Behrstock inequality
and a Bounded Geodesic Image theorem. Our proof of the latter relies on a
method of canonically visualizing one sphere `with respect to' another given
sphere, which we call a sphere tree. Sphere trees are related to Hatcher normal
form for spheres, and coincide with an interpretation of certain slices of a
Guirardel core.
