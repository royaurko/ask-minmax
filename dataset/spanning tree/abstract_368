In this paper we use wavelet concepts to show that correlation coefficient
between two financial data's is not constant but varies with scale from high
correlation value to strongly anti-correlation value This studies is important
because correlation coefficient is used to quantify degree of independence
between two variables. In econophysics correlation coefficient forms important
input to evolve hierarchial tree and minimum spanning tree of financial data.
