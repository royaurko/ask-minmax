In last couple years, an important relation (BCJ relation) between
color-ordered tree-level scattering amplitudes of gauge theory has inspired
many studies. This relation implies that the minimal basis for the
color-ordered tree-level amplitudes is $(n-3)!$ and other amplitudes can be
expanded into a particular chosen basis. In this paper we will prove the
conjectured explicit minimal basis expansion. For this purpose we will write
down general BCJ relation of gauge theory by taking the field theory limit of
BCJ relation in string theory. Then we prove these general BCJ relations using
BCFW on-shell recursion relation. Using these general BCJ relations, we prove
the conjectured explicit minimal-basis expansion of gauge theory tree
amplitudes inductively.
