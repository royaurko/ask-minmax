We try to perform geometrization of cognitive science and psychology by
representing information states of cognitive systems by points of {\it mental
space} given by a hierarchic $m$-adic tree. Associations are represented by
balls and ideas by collections of balls. We consider dynamics of ideas based on
lifting of dynamics of mental points. We apply our dynamical model for modeling
of flows of unconscious and conscious information in the human brain. In series
of models, Models 1-3, we consider cognitive systems with increasing complexity
of psychological behavior determined by structure of flows of associations and
ideas.
