We analyse a class of two Higgs doublet models where flavour-changing neutral
currents (FCNC) are present at tree level in a mixing-suppressed manner. In
this class of models, because of a discrete symmetry imposed on the lagrangian,
the FCNC couplings in the quark and lepton sector are fixed in terms of the
corresponding mixing matrix (CKM or PMNS), the fermion masses and the ratio
$v_2/v_1$ of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral scalars. A large
number of processes, including tree and loop level transitions mediated by the
new charged or neutral scalars are used as constraints. It is shown that among
the interesting phenomenological prospects for these models, the new scalars
may have masses within experimental reach.
