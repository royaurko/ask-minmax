Web Effort Estimation is a process of predicting the efforts and cost in
terms of money, schedule and staff for any software project system. Many
estimation models have been proposed over the last three decades and it is
believed that it is a must for the purpose of: Budgeting, risk analysis,
project planning and control, and project improvement investment analysis. In
this paper, we investigate the use of Fuzzy ID3 decision tree for software cost
estimation; it is designed by integrating the principles of ID3 decision tree
and the fuzzy set-theoretic concepts, enabling the model to handle uncertain
and imprecise data when describing the software projects, which can improve
greatly the accuracy of obtained estimates. MMRE and Pred are used as measures
of prediction accuracy for this study. A series of experiments is reported
using two different software projects datasets namely, Tukutuku and COCOMO'81
datasets. The results are compared with those produced by the crisp version of
the ID3 decision tree.
