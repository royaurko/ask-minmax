The teleportation of an unknown polarization state of one of the photons in a
system of identical particles has been considered. It has been shown that
spatial degrees of freedom, which are various directions of the momentum of
three photons, are of significant importance for teleportation in the system of
identical particles. The inclusion of the spatial degrees of freedom increases
the dimension of single-particle state space. In view of this increase, a
four-dimensional subspace of two-particle states, which is similar to the state
space spanned by the Bell states in a system of two distinguishable qubits, can
be separated in the experimental configuration.
