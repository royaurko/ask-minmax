We study subset selection for matrices defined as follows: given a matrix
$\matX \in \R^{n \times m}$ ($m > n$) and an oversampling parameter $k$ ($n \le
k \le m$), select a subset of $k$ columns from $\matX$ such that the
pseudo-inverse of the subsampled matrix has as smallest norm as possible. In
this work, we focus on the Frobenius and the spectral matrix norms. We describe
several novel (deterministic and randomized) approximation algorithms for this
problem with approximation bounds that are optimal up to constant factors.
Additionally, we show that the combinatorial problem of finding a low-stretch
spanning tree in an undirected graph corresponds to subset selection, and
discuss various implications of this reduction.
