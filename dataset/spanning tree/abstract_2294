We demonstrate the possibility of coding parts, features that are higher
level than boundaries, using a modified AT field after augmenting the
interaction term of the AT energy with a non-local term and weakening the
separation into boundary/not-boundary phases. The iteratively extracted parts
using the level curves with double point singularities are organized as a
proper binary tree. Inconsistencies due to non-generic configurations for level
curves as well as due to visual changes such as occlusion are successfully
handled once the tree is endowed with a probabilistic structure. The work is a
step in establishing the AT function as a bridge between low and high level
visual processing.
