Cayley's formula states that the number of labelled trees on $n$ vertices is
$n^{n-2}$, and many of the current proofs involve complex structures or
rigorous computation. We present a bijective proof of the formula by providing
an elementary calculation of the probability that a cycle occurs in a random
map from an $n$-element set to an $n+1$-element set.
