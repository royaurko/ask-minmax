An overview of plans for the measurement of gamma at the LHCb experiment will
be shown. The gamma angle is the least accurately known parameter of the CKM
unitary triangle. The LHCb experiment at the CERN LHC aims to perform precision
heavy flavour and CP violation measurements, including improving the knowledge
of gamma. Focus will be put on methods using B meson decays at the tree level,
within the Standard Model framework. The early data recorded by the experiment,
from pp collisions at sqrt{s} = 7 TeV, allowed observations of the first
signals of the B decay modes that will be used to perform this measurement.
