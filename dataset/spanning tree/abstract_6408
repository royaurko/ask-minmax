Model dependence of the capture rates of the negative muon capture in
deuterium is studied starting from potential models and the weak two-body meson
exchange currents constructed in the tree approximation and also from an
effective field theory. The tree one-boson exchange currents are derived from
the hard pion chiral Lagrangians of the $N \Delta \pi \rho \omega a_1$ system.
If constructed in conjunction with the one-boson exchange potentials, the
capture rates can be calculated consistently. On the other hand, the effective
field theory currents, constructed within the heavy baryon chiral perturbation
theory, contain a low energy constant $\hat d ^R$ that cannot be extracted from
data at the one-particle level nor determined from the first principles.
Comparative analysis of the results for the doublet transition rate allows us
to extract the constant $\hat d ^R$.
