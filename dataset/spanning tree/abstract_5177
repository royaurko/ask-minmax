This note answers one question in [math.PR/0505668], concerning the connected
allocation for the Poisson process in R^2. The proposed solution makes use of
the Riemann map from the plane minus the minimal spanning forest of the Poisson
point process to the halfplane. A picture of a numerically simulated example is
included.
