We introduce a promising alternative to the usual hidden Markov tree model
for Gaussian wavelet coefficients, where their variances are specified by the
hidden states and take values in a finite set. In our new model, the hidden
states have a similar dependence structure but they are jointly Gaussian, and
the wavelet coefficients have log-variances equal to the hidden states. We
argue why this provides a flexible model where frequentist and Bayesian
inference procedures become tractable for estimation of parameters and hidden
states. Our methodology is illustrated for denoising and edge detection
problems in two-dimensional images.
