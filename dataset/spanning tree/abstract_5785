In this article, we will prove that the set of 4-dissimilarity vectors of
n-trees is contained in the tropical Grassmannian G_{4,n}. We will also propose
three equivalent conjectures related to the set of m-dissimilarity vectors of
n-trees for the case m > 4. Using a computer algebra system, we can prove these
conjectures for m = 5.
