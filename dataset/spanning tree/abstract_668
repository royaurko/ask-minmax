We study the load distribution in weighted networks by measuring the
effective number of optimal paths passing through a given vertex. The optimal
path, along which the total cost is minimum, crucially depend on the cost
distribution function $p_c(c)$. In the strong disorder limit, where $p_c(c)\sim
c^{-1}$, the load distribution follows a power law both in the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) random graphs and in the scale-free (SF) networks, and
its characteristics are determined by the structure of the minimum spanning
tree. The distribution of loads at vertices with a given vertex degree also
follows the SF nature similar to the whole load distribution, implying that the
global transport property is not correlated to the local structural
information. Finally, we measure the effect of disorder by the correlation
coefficient between vertex degree and load, finding that it is larger for ER
networks than for SF networks.
