We present parallel algorithms for wavelet tree construction with
polylogarithmic depth, improving upon the linear depth of the recent parallel
algorithms by Fuentes-Sepulveda et al. We experimentally show on a 40-core
machine with two-way hyper-threading that we outperform the existing parallel
algorithms by 1.3--5.6x and achieve up to 27x speedup over the sequential
algorithm on a variety of real-world and artificial inputs. Our algorithms show
good scalability with increasing thread count, input size and alphabet size. We
also discuss extensions to variants of the standard wavelet tree.
