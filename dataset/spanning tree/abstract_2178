A $k-$quasiperfect dominating set ($k\ge 1$) of a graph $G$ is a vertex
subset $S$ such that every vertex not in $S$ is adjacent to at least one and at
most k vertices in $S$. The cardinality of a minimum k-quasiperfect dominating
set in $G$ is denoted by $\gamma_{\stackrel{}{1k}}(G)$. Those sets were first
introduced by Chellali et al. (2013) as a generalization of the perfect
domination concept. The quasiperfect domination chain
$\gamma_{\stackrel{}{11}}(G)\ge\gamma_{\stackrel{}{12}}(G)\ge\dots\ge\gamma_{\stackrel{}{1\Delta}}(G)=\gamma(G)$,
indicates what it is lost in size when you move towards a more perfect
domination. We provide an upper bound for $\gamma_{\stackrel{}{1k}}(T)$ in any
tree $T$ and trees achieving this bound are characterized. We prove that there
exist trees satisfying all the possible equalities and inequalities in this
chain and a linear algorithm for computing $\gamma_{\stackrel{}{1k}}(T)$ in any
tree is presented.
