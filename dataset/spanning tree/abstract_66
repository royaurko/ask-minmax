We define the notion of a spanning tree generating function (STGF) $\sum a_n
z^n$, which gives the spanning tree constant when evaluated at $z=1,$ and gives
the lattice Green function (LGF) when differentiated. By making use of known
results for logarithmic Mahler measures of certain Laurent polynomials, and
proving new results, we express the STGFs as hypergeometric functions for all
regular two and three dimensional lattices (and one higher-dimensional
lattice). This gives closed form expressions for the spanning tree constants
for all such lattices, which were previously largely unknown in all but one
three-dimensional case. We show for all lattices that these can also be
represented as Dirichlet $L$-series. Making the connection between spanning
tree generating functions and lattice Green functions produces integral
identities and hypergeometric connections, some of which appear to be new.
