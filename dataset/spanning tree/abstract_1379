A {\it heterochromatic tree} is an edge-colored tree in which any two edges
have different colors. The {\it heterochromatic tree partition number} of an
$r$-edge-colored graph $G$, denoted by $t_r(G)$, is the minimum positive
integer $p$ such that whenever the edges of the graph $G$ are colored with $r$
colors, the vertices of $G$ can be covered by at most $p$ vertex-disjoint
heterochromatic trees. In this paper we determine the heterochromatic tree
partition number of an $r$-edge-colored complete graph.
