We exploit a recently found connection between special triple-cut diagrams
and tree-level recursive diagrams to derive a general formula capturing the
multi-particle factorisation of arbitrary one-loop amplitudes in the ABJM
theory. This formula contains certain anomalous contributions which are
reminiscent of the so-called non-factorising contributions appearing in the
factorisation of one-loop amplitudes in four-dimensional gauge theory. In the
second part of the paper we derive a recursion relation for the
supercoefficients of one-loop amplitudes in ABJM theory. By applying this
recursion relation, any one-loop supercoefficient can be reduced to special
triple-cut diagrams involving at least one four-point tree amplitude. In turn,
this implies that any one-loop supercoefficient can be derived from tree-level
recursive diagrams.
