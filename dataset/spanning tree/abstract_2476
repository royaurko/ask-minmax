We study the relationship between a $\kappa$-Souslin tree $T$ and its reduced
powers $T^\theta/\mathcal U$.
  Previous works addressed this problem from the viewpoint of a single power
$\theta$, whereas here, tools are developed for controlling different powers
simultaneously. As a sample corollary, we obtain the consistency of an
$\aleph_6$-Souslin tree and a sequence of uniform ultrafilters $\langle
\mathcal U_n\mid n<6\rangle$ such that $ T^{\aleph_n}/\mathcal U_n$ is
$\aleph_6$-Aronszajn iff $n<6$ is not a prime number.
