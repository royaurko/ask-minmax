In this paper we introduce a variation on the multidimensional segment tree,
formed by unifying different interpretations of the dimensionalities of the
data structure. We give some new definitions to previously well-defined
concepts that arise naturally in this variation, and we show some properties
concerning the relationships between the nodes, and the regions those nodes
represent. We think these properties will enable the data to be utilized in new
situations, beyond those previously studied. As an example, we show that the
data structure can be used to solve the Rectangle Intersection Problem in a
more straightforward and natural way than had be done in the past.
