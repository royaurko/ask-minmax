We consider Galton-Watson trees with ${\rm Bin}(d,p)$ offspring distribution.
We let $T_{\infty}(p)$ denote such a tree conditioned on being infinite. For
$d=2,3$ and any $1/d\leq p_1 <p_2 \leq 1$, we show that there exists a coupling
between $T_{\infty}(p_1)$ and $T_{\infty}(p_2)$ such that ${\mathbb
P}(T_{\infty}(p_1) \subseteq T_{\infty}(p_2))=1.$
