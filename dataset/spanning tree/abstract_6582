We study the number of 231-avoiding permutations with $j$-descents and
maximum drop is less than or equal to $k$ which we denote by
$a_{n,231,j}^{(k)}$. We show that $a_{n,231,j}^{(k)}$ also counts the number of
Dyck paths of length $2n$ with $n-j$ peaks and height $\leq k+1$, and the
number of ordered trees with $n$ edges, $j+1$ internal nodes, and of height
$\leq k+1$. We show that the generating functions for the $a_{n,231,j}^{(k)}$s
with $k$ fixed satisfy a simple recursion. We also use the combinatorics of
ordered trees to prove new explicit formulas for $a_{n,231,j}^{(k)}$ as a
function of $n$ in a number of special values of $j$ and $k$ and prove a simple
recursion for the $a_{n,231,j}^{(k)}$s.
