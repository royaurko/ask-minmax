Bounded treewidth and Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic have proved to be key
concepts in establishing fixed-parameter tractability results. Indeed, by
Courcelle's Theorem we know: Any property of finite structures, which is
expressible by an MSO sentence, can be decided in linear time (data complexity)
if the structures have bounded treewidth.
  In principle, Courcelle's Theorem can be applied directly to construct
concrete algorithms by transforming the MSO evaluation problem into a tree
language recognition problem. The latter can then be solved via a finite tree
automaton (FTA). However, this approach has turned out to be problematical,
since even relatively simple MSO formulae may lead to a ``state explosion'' of
the FTA.
  In this work we propose monadic datalog (i.e., datalog where all intentional
predicate symbols are unary) as an alternative method to tackle this class of
fixed-parameter tractable problems. We show that if some property of finite
structures is expressible in MSO then this property can also be expressed by
means of a monadic datalog program over the structure plus the tree
decomposition.
  Moreover, we show that the resulting fragment of datalog can be evaluated in
linear time (both w.r.t. the program size and w.r.t. the data size). This new
approach is put to work by devising new algorithms for the 3-Colorability
problem of graphs and for the PRIMALITY problem of relational schemas (i.e.,
testing if some attribute in a relational schema is part of a key). We also
report on experimental results with a prototype implementation.
