We introduce a colored coalescent process which recovers random colored
genealogical trees. Here a colored genealogical tree has its vertices colored
black or white. Moving backward along the colored genealogical tree, the color
of vertices may change only when two vertice coalesce. The rule that governs
the change of color involves a parameter $x$. When $x=1/2$, the colored
coalescent process can be derived from a variant of the Wright-Fisher model for
a haploid population in population genetics. Explicit computations of the
expectation and the cumulative distribution function of the coalescent time are
carried out. For example, our calculation shows that when $x=1/2$, for a sample
of $n$ colored individuals, the expected time for the colored coalescent
process to reach a black MRAC or a white MRAC, respectively, is $3-2/n$. On the
other hand, the expected time for the colored coalescent process to reach a
MRAC, either black or white, is $2-2/n$, which is the same as that for the
standard Kingman coalescent process.
