Among the distance based algorithms in phylogenetic tree reconstruction, the
neighbor-joining algorithm has been a widely used and effective method. We
propose a new algorithm which counts the number of consistent quartets for
cherry picking with tie breaking. We show that the success rate of the new
algorithm is almost equal to that of neighbor-joining. This gives an
explanation of the qualitative nature of neighbor-joining and that of
dissimilarity maps from DNA sequence data. Moreover, the new algorithm always
reconstructs correct trees from quartet consistent dissimilarity maps.
