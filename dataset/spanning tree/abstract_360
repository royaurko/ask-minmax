To understand the isospin effects in nearly symmetric nuclear matter we
performed a complete systematical theoretical study within an Isospin dependent
Quantum Molecular Dynamical Model (IQMD) and using Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
algorithm. Simulations are carried out for the reactions
$_{124}Sn^{50}+_{124}Sn^{50}$ and $_{107}Sn^{50}+_{124}Sn^{50}$. The collision
geometry is varied from central to peripheral. We find that neutron rich
colliding nuclei are better candidate to study the isospin effects
