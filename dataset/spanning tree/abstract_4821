A non-backtracking walk on a graph, $H$, is a directed path of directed edges
of $H$ such that no edge is the inverse of its preceding edge. Non-backtracking
walks of a given length can be counted using the non-backtracking adjacency
matrix, $B$, indexed by $H$'s directed edges and related to Ihara's Zeta
function. We show how to determine $B$'s spectrum in the case where $H$ is a
tree covering a finite graph. We show that when $H$ is not regular, this
spectrum can have positive measure in the complex plane, unlike the regular
case. We show that outside of $B$'s spectrum, the corresponding Green function
has ``periodic decay ratios.'' The existence of such a ``ratio system'' can be
effectively checked, and is equivalent to being outside the spectrum. We also
prove that the spectral radius of the non-backtracking walk operator on the
tree covering a finite graph is exactly $\sqrt\gr$, where $\gr$ is the growth
rate of the tree. This further motivates the definition of the graph
theoretical Riemann hypothesis proposed by Stark and Terras \cite{ST}. Finally,
we give experimental evidence that for a fixed, finite graph, $H$, a random
lift of large degree has non-backtracking new spectrum near that of $H$'s
universal cover. This suggests a new generalization of Alon's second eigenvalue
conjecture.
