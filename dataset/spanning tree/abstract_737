The operation of replacing every vertex of an $r$-regular lattice $H$ by a
complete graph of order $r$ is called clique-inserting, and the resulting
lattice is called the clique-inserted-lattice of $H$. For any given $r$-regular
lattice, applying this operation iteratively, an infinite family of $r$-regular
lattices is generated. Some interesting lattices including the 3-12-12 lattice
can be constructed this way. In this paper, we reveal the relationship between
the energy and resistance distance of an $r$-regular lattice and that of its
clique-inserted-lattice. As an application, the asymptotic energy per vertex
and average resistance distance of the 3-12-12 and 3-6-24 lattices are
computed. We also give formulae expressing the numbers of spanning trees and
dimers of the $k$-th iterated clique-inserted lattices in terms of that of the
original lattice. Moreover, we show that new families of expander graphs can be
constructed from the known ones by clique-inserting.
