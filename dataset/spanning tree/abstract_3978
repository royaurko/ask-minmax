This paper addresses the design and implementation of BiLingual Information
Retrieval system on the domain, Festivals. A generic platform is built for
BiLingual Information retrieval which can be extended to any foreign or Indian
language working with the same efficiency. Search for the solution of the query
is not done in a specific predefined set of standard languages but is chosen
dynamically on processing the user's query. This paper deals with Indian
language Tamil apart from English. The task is to retrieve the solution for the
user given query in the same language as that of the query. In this process, a
Ontological tree is built for the domain in such a way that there are entries
in the above listed two languages in every node of the tree. A Part-Of-Speech
(POS) Tagger is used to determine the keywords from the given query. Based on
the context, the keywords are translated to appropriate languages using the
Ontological tree. A search is performed and documents are retrieved based on
the keywords. With the use of the Ontological tree, Information Extraction is
done. Finally, the solution for the query is translated back to the query
language (if necessary) and produced to the user.
