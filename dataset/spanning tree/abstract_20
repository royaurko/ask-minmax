We consider the problem of constructing a single spanning tree for the
single-source buy-at-bulk network design problem for doubling-dimension graphs.
We compute a spanning tree to route a set of demands (or data) along a graph to
or from a designated root node. The demands could be aggregated at (or
symmetrically distributed to) intermediate nodes where the fusion-cost is
specified by a non-negative concave function $f$. We describe a novel approach
for developing an oblivious spanning tree in the sense that it is independent
of the number of data sources (or demands) and cost function at intermediate
nodes. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a single spanning
tree solution to this problem (as opposed to multiple overlay trees). There has
been no prior work where the tree is oblivious to both the fusion cost function
and the set of sources (demands). We present a deterministic, polynomial-time
algorithm for constructing a spanning tree in low doubling graphs that
guarantees $\log^{3}D\cdot\log n$-approximation over the optimal cost, where
$D$ is the diameter of the graph and $n$ the total number of nodes. With
constant fusion-cost function our spanning tree gives a $O(\log^3
D)$-approximation for every Steiner tree to the root.
