Two types of data sets for investigation of solar- modulated cycles in the
climate of Bulgaria during the last ~ 200 years has been used in this study: 1.
Instrumental data for the rainfalls and temperatures in 26 stations during the
period AD 1899-1994; A smoothing dendrochronological data series of the tree
rings width of a beech sample (Fagus) for the period of AD 1780-1982. The data
proceedings has been provided separately for the "winter" (November-April) and
"summer" (May-October) half- years. A well expressed quasi-20-22 and 54 yr
cycles in the rains and temperature instrumental "summer" series as well as
quasi 11yr cycle for the "winter" temeperature data has been established for
the studied period 1899-1994. However there are also very serious variations of
the 11 and 22 yr cycle magnitudes. The quasi 20-22 yr ("summer") cycle is weak
expressed before AD 1930, while the 11 yr (winter) cycle is faded rapidly after
~AD 1975/76. The existence of 20-22 yr climatic cycle could be traced since the
end of the supercenturial solar Dalton minimum (AD 1795-1830) in the beech tree
ring width series. Strong cycles by duration of 54, 67 and 115 years are also
found in this series. All they have solar analogs (in the coronal activity as
well as in the "cosmogenic" 10Be and aurora activity data series). Extreme
little tree ring widths during the Dalton minimum has been detected.
