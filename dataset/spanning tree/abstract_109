Halin proved in 1978 that there exists a normal spanning tree in every
connected graph $G$ that satisfies the following two conditions: (i) $G$
contains no subdivision of a `fat' $K_{\aleph_0}$, one in which every edge has
been replaced by uncountably many parallel edges; and (ii) $G$ has no
$K_{\aleph_0}$ subgraph. We show that the second condition is unnecessary.
