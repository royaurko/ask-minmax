Maximum likelihood is one of the most widely used techniques to infer
evolutionary histories. Although it is thought to be intractable, a proof of
its hardness has been lacking. Here, we give a short proof that computing the
maximum likelihood tree is NP-hard by exploiting a connection between
likelihood and parsimony observed by Tuffley and Steel.
