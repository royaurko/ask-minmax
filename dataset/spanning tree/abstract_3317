The positive half of the Witt algebra is the Lie algebra spanned by vector
fields x^{m+1} d/dx acting as differentiations on the polynomial algebra Q[x]
upon which the Soergel bimodule construction of triply graded link homology is
based. We show that this action of Witt algebra can be extended to the link
homology.
