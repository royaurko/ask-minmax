Quantitative assessment of the uncertainties tainting the results of computer
simulations is nowadays a major topic of interest in both industrial and
scientific communities. One of the key issues in such studies is to get
information about the output when the numerical simulations are expensive to
run. This paper considers the problem of exploring the whole space of
variations of the computer model input variables in the context of a large
dimensional exploration space. Various properties of space filling designs are
justified: interpoint-distance, discrepancy, minimum spanning tree criteria. A
specific class of design, the optimized Latin Hypercube Sample, is considered.
Several optimization algorithms, coming from the literature, are studied in
terms of convergence speed, robustness to subprojection and space filling
properties of the resulting design. Some recommendations for building such
designs are given. Finally, another contribution of this paper is the deep
analysis of the space filling properties of the design 2D-subprojections.
