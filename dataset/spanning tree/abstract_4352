Recently, variational approximations such as the mean field approximation
have received much interest. We extend the standard mean field method by using
an approximating distribution that factorises into cluster potentials. This
includes undirected graphs, directed acyclic graphs and junction trees. We
derive generalized mean field equations to optimize the cluster potentials. We
show that the method bridges the gap between the standard mean field
approximation and the exact junction tree algorithm. In addition, we address
the problem of how to choose the graphical structure of the approximating
distribution. From the generalised mean field equations we derive rules to
simplify the structure of the approximating distribution in advance without
affecting the quality of the approximation. We also show how the method fits
into some other variational approximations that are currently popular.
