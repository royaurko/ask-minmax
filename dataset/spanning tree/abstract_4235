We focus on credal nets, which are graphical models that generalise Bayesian
nets to imprecise probability. We replace the notion of strong independence
commonly used in credal nets with the weaker notion of epistemic irrelevance,
which is arguably more suited for a behavioural theory of probability. Focusing
on directed trees, we show how to combine the given local uncertainty models in
the nodes of the graph into a global model, and we use this to construct and
justify an exact message-passing algorithm that computes updated beliefs for a
variable in the tree. The algorithm, which is linear in the number of nodes, is
formulated entirely in terms of coherent lower previsions, and is shown to
satisfy a number of rationality requirements. We supply examples of the
algorithm's operation, and report an application to on-line character
recognition that illustrates the advantages of our approach for prediction. We
comment on the perspectives, opened by the availability, for the first time, of
a truly efficient algorithm based on epistemic irrelevance.
