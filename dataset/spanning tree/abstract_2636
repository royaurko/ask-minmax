We derive the distribution of the center of mass $S$ of the integrated
superBrownian excursion (ISE) {from} the asymptotic distribution of the Wiener
index for simple trees. Equivalently, this is the distribution of the integral
of a Brownian snake. A recursion formula for the moments and asymptotics for
moments and tail probabilities are derived.
