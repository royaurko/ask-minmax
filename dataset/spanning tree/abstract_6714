The reconstruction of phylogenies from DNA or protein sequences is a major
task of computational evolutionary biology. Common phenomena, notably
variations in mutation rates across genomes and incongruences between gene
lineage histories, often make it necessary to model molecular data as
originating from a mixture of phylogenies. Such mixed models play an
increasingly important role in practice. Using concentration of measure
techniques, we show that mixtures of large trees are typically identifiable. We
also derive sequence-length requirements for high-probability reconstruction.
