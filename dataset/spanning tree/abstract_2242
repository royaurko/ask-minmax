The non-associative exponential series $exp(x)$ is a power series with
monomials from the magma $M$ of finite, planar rooted trees. The coefficient
$a(t)$ of $exp(x)$ relative to a tree $t$ of degree $n$ is a rational number
and it is shown that $$\hat{a}(t) := \frac{a(t)}{2^{n-1}\cdot
\prod^{n-1}_{i=1}(2^i - 1)}$$ is an integer which is a product of Mersenne
binomials. One obtains summation formulas $$\sum \hat{a}(t) = \omega(n)$$ where
the sum is extended over all trees $t$ in $M$ of degree $n$ and $$\omega(n) =
\frac{2^{n-1}}{n!} \prod^{n-1}_{i=1} (2^i - 1).$$ The prime factorization of
$\omega(n)$ is described. The sequence $(\omega(n))_{n \ge 1}$ seems to be of
interest.
