Submodular functions are an important class of functions in combinatorial
optimization which satisfy the natural properties of decreasing marginal costs.
The study of these functions has led to strong structural properties with
applications in many areas. Recently, there has been significant interest in
extending the theory of algorithms for optimizing combinatorial problems (such
as network design problem of spanning tree) over submodular functions.
Unfortunately, the lower bounds under the general class of submodular functions
are known to be very high for many of the classical problems.
  In this paper, we introduce and study an important subclass of submodular
functions, which we call discounted price functions. These functions are
succinctly representable and generalize linear cost functions. In this paper we
study the following fundamental combinatorial optimization problems: Edge
Cover, Spanning Tree, Perfect Matching and Shortest Path, and obtain tight
upper and lower bounds for these problems.
  The main technical contribution of this paper is designing novel adaptive
greedy algorithms for the above problems. These algorithms greedily build the
solution whist rectifying mistakes made in the previous steps.
