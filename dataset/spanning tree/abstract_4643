We solve the escape problem for the Heston random diffusion model. We obtain
exact expressions for the survival probability (which ammounts to solving the
complete escape problem) as well as for the mean exit time. We also average the
volatility in order to work out the problem for the return alone regardless
volatility. We look over these results in terms of the dimensionless normal
level of volatility --a ratio of the three parameters that appear in the Heston
model-- and analyze their form in several assymptotic limits. Thus, for
instance, we show that the mean exit time grows quadratically with large spans
while for small spans the growth is systematically slower depending on the
value of the normal level. We compare our results with those of the Wiener
process and show that the assumption of stochastic volatility, in an apparent
paradoxical way, increases survival and prolongs the escape time.
