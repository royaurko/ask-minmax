For a two-dimensional lattice $\Lambda$ with $n$ vertices, the number of
spanning trees $N_{ST}(\Lambda)$ grows asymptotically as $\exp(n z_\Lambda)$ in
the thermodynamic limit. We present exact integral expression and numerical
value for the asymptotic growth constant $z_\Lambda$ for spanning trees on
various two-dimensional lattices with more than one type of vertex given in
\cite{Okeeffe}. An exact closed-form expression for the asymptotic growth
constant is derived for net 14, and the asymptotic growth constants of net 27
and the triangle lattice have the simple relation $z_{27} = (z_{tri}+\ln 4)/4$.
Some integral identities are also obtained.
