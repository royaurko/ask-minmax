The concept of maximum local connectivity $\bar {\kappa}$ of a graph was
introduced by Bollob\'{a}s. One of the problems about it is to determine the
largest number of edges $f(n;\bar{\kappa}\leq \ell)$ for graphs of order $n$
that have local connectivity at most $\ell$. We consider a generalization of
the above concept and problem. For $S\subseteq V(G)$ and $|S|\geq 2$, the
\emph{generalized local connectivity} $\kappa(S)$ is the maximum number of
internally disjoint trees connecting $S$ in $G$. The parameter
$\bar{\kappa}_k(G)=max\{\kappa(S)|S\subseteq V(G),|S|=k\}$ is called the
\emph{maximum generalized local connectivity} of $G$. This paper it to consider
the problem of determining the largest number $f(n;\bar{\kappa}_k\leq \ell)$ of
edges for graphs of order $n$ that have maximum generalized local connectivity
at most $\ell$. The exact value of $f(n;\bar{\kappa}_k\leq \ell)$ for $k=n,n-1$
is determined. For a general $k$, we construct a graph to obtain a sharp lower
bound.
