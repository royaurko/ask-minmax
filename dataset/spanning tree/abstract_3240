The structure of the three-dimensional random field Ising magnet is studied
by ground state calculations. We investigate the percolation of the minority
spin orientation in the paramagnetic phase above the bulk phase transition,
located at [Delta/J]_c ~= 2.27, where Delta is the standard deviation of the
Gaussian random fields (J=1). With an external field H there is a disorder
strength dependent critical field +/- H_c(Delta) for the down (or up) spin
spanning. The percolation transition is in the standard percolation
universality class. H_c ~ (Delta - Delta_p)^{delta}, where Delta_p = 2.43 +/-
0.01 and delta = 1.31 +/- 0.03, implying a critical line for Delta_c < Delta <=
Delta_p. When, with zero external field, Delta is decreased from a large value
there is a transition from the simultaneous up and down spin spanning, with
probability Pi_{uparrow downarrow} = 1.00 to Pi_{uparrow downarrow} = 0. This
is located at Delta = 2.32 +/- 0.01, i.e., above Delta_c. The spanning cluster
has the fractal dimension of standard percolation D_f = 2.53 at H = H_c(Delta).
We provide evidence that this is asymptotically true even at H=0 for Delta_c <
Delta <= Delta_p beyond a crossover scale that diverges as Delta_c is
approached from above. Percolation implies extra finite size effects in the
ground states of the 3D RFIM.
