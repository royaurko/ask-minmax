In a phylogenetic tree, we often don't have information about the time a
speciation event (inner node) occured. Under a neutral model for speciation, I
develop fast algorithms for calculating the probability that an inner node i is
the k-th speciation event. For the Yule and the coalescent model, I develop an
edge length estimation as well. Various properties of the Yule model are
discussed throughout the thesis.
