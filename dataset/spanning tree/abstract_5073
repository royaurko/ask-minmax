We show that choosing appropriate distributions of the randomness, the search
for optimal paths links diverse problems of disordered media like directed
percolation, invasion percolation, directed and non-directed spanning polymers.
We also introduce a simple and efficient algorithm, which solves the
d-dimensional model numerically in order N^(1+d_f/d) steps where d_f is the
fractal dimension of the path. Using extensive simulations in two dimensions we
identify the phase boundaries of the directed polymer universality class. A new
strong-disorder phase occurs where the optimum paths are self-affine with
parameter-dependent scaling exponents. Furthermore, the phase diagram contains
directed and non-directed percolation as well as the directed random walk
models at specific points and lines.
