We relate the fractal dimension of the backbone, and the spectral dimension
of Eden trees to the dynamical exponent z. In two dimensions, it gives fractal
dimension of backbone equal to 4/3 and spectral dimension of trees equal to
5/4. In three dimensions, it provides us a new way to estimate z numerically.
We get z=1.617 +/- 0.004.
