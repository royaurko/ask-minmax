We present new images and photometry of the massive star forming complex
Cygnus X obtained with IRAC and MIPS on the Spitzer Space Telescope. A
combination of IRAC, MIPS, UKIDSS, and 2MASS data are used to identify and
classify young stellar objects. Of the 8,231 sources detected exhibiting
infrared excess in Cygnus X North, 670 are classified as Class I and 7,249 are
classified as Class II. Using spectra from the FAST spectrograph at the Fred L.
Whipple Observatory and Hectospec on the MMT, we spectrally typed 536 sources
in the Cygnus X complex to identify the massive stars. We find that YSOs tend
to be grouped in the neighborhoods of massive B stars (spectral types B0 to
B9). We present a minimal spanning tree analysis of clusters in two regions in
Cygnus X North. The fraction of infrared excess sources that belong to clusters
with >10 members is found to be 50--70%. Most Class II objects lie in dense
clusters within blown out HII regions, while Class I sources tend to reside in
more filamentary structures along the bright-rimmed clouds, indicating possible
triggered star formation.
