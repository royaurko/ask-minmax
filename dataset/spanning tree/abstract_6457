We propose a new method for hierarchical clustering based on the optimisation
of a cost function over trees of limited depth, and we derive a
message--passing method that allows to solve it efficiently. The method and
algorithm can be interpreted as a natural interpolation between two well-known
approaches, namely single linkage and the recently presented Affinity
Propagation. We analyze with this general scheme three biological/medical
structured datasets (human population based on genetic information, proteins
based on sequences and verbal autopsies) and show that the interpolation
technique provides new insight.
