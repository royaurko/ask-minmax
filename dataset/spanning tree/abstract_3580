We investigate the relationship between two kinds of vertex colorings of
hypergraphs: unique-maximum colorings and conflict-free colorings. In a
unique-maximum coloring, the colors are ordered, and in every hyperedge of the
hypergraph the maximum color appears only once. In a conflict-free coloring, in
every hyperedge of the hypergraph there is a color that appears only once. We
define corresponding unique-maximum and conflict-free chromatic numbers and
investigate their relationship in arbitrary hypergraphs. Then, we concentrate
on hypergraphs that are induced by simple paths in tree graphs.
