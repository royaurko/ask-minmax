We study evolution equations governed by an averaging operator on a directed
tree, showing existence and uniqueness of solutions. In addition we find
conditions of the initial condition that allows us to find the asymptotic decay
rate of the solutions as $t\to \infty$. It turns out that this decay rate is
not uniform, it strongly depends on how the initial condition goes to zero as
one goes down in the tree.
