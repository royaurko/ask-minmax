We study the bijection between binary Galton--Watson trees in continuous time
and their exploration process, both in the sub- and in the supercritical cases.
We then take the limit over renormalized quantities, as the size of the
population tends to infinity. We thus deduce Delmas' generalization of the
second Ray--Knight theorem.
