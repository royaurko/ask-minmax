Let P be a finite set of points in general position in the plane. The
structure of the complete graph K(P) as a geometric graph includes, for any
pair [a,b],[c,d] of vertex-disjoint edges, the information whether they cross
or not.
  The simple (i.e., non-crossing) spanning trees (SSTs) of K(P) are the
vertices of the so-called Geometric Tree Graph of P, G(P). Two such vertices
are adjacent in G(P) if they differ in exactly two edges, i.e., if one can be
obtained from the other by deleting an edge and adding another edge.
  In this paper we show how to reconstruct from G(P) (regarded as an abstract
graph) the structure of K(P) as a geometric graph. We first identify within
G(P) the vertices that correspond to spanning stars. Then we regard each star
S(z) with center z as the representative in G(P) of the vertex z of K(P). (This
correspondence is determined only up to an automorphism of K(P) as a geometric
graph.) Finally we determine for any four distinct stars S(a), S(b), S(c), and
S(d), by looking at their relative positions in G(P), whether the corresponding
segments cross.
