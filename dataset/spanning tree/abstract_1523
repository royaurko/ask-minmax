In this work, we propose a library that enables on a cloud the creation and
management of tree data structures from a cloud client. As a proof of concept,
we implement a new cloud service CloudTree. With CloudTree, users are able to
organize big data into tree data structures of their choice that are physically
stored in a cloud. We use caching, prefetching, and aggregation techniques in
the design and implementation of CloudTree to enhance performance. We have
implemented the services of Binary Search Trees (BST) and Prefix Trees as
current members in CloudTree and have benchmarked their performance using the
Amazon Cloud. The idea and techniques in the design and implementation of a BST
and prefix tree is generic and thus can also be used for other types of trees
such as B-tree, and other link-based data structures such as linked lists and
graphs. Preliminary experimental results show that CloudTree is useful and
efficient for various big data applications.
