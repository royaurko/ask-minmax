Traffic grooming is widely employed to reduce the number of ADM's and
wavelengths. We consider the problem of grooming of dynamic traffic in WDM tree
and star networks in this paper. To achieve better results, we used the
bifurcation techniques to the grooming of arbitrary dynamic traffic in a
strictly non-blocking manner in networks. Three splitting methods, including
Traffic-Cutting, Traffic-Dividing and Synthesized-Splitting were proposed. A
genetic algorithm (GA) approach based on these methods was proposed to tackle
such grooming problems in tree and star networks. The performance of these
algorithms was tested under different conditions in star and tree networks.
Computer simulation results showed that our algorithm is efficient in reducing
both the numbers of ADM's and wavelengths.
