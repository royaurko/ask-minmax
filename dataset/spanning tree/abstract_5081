We demonstrate that there is no ideal glass transition in a binary hard-disk
mixture by explicitly constructing an exponential number of jammed packings
with densities spanning the spectrum from the accepted ``amorphous'' glassy
state to the phase-separated crystal. Thus the configurational entropy cannot
be zero for an ideal amorphous glass, presumed distinct from the crystal in
numerous theoretical and numerical estimates in the literature. This objection
parallels our previous critique of the idea that there is a most-dense random
(close) packing for hard spheres [Torquato et al, Phys. Rev. Lett., 84, 2064
(2000)].
