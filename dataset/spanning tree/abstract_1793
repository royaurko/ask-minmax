Between the leaves and the nodes of a complete binary tree, a separate
parent-child-sister hierarchy is employed independent of the
parent-child-sister hierarchy used for the rest of the tree. Two different
versions of such a local hierarchy are introduced. The result of the first
proposed hierarchy is a faster and smaller footprint, while the second one
provides the size variation functionality without a significant computational
overhead. This novel approach brings considerable memory gains and performance
boosts to the complete binary tree based algorithms.
