This fluid dynamics video depicts the evolution of a suspension of
paramagnetic colloids under the influence of a uniform, pulsed magnetic field.
At low pulse frequencies, the suspension condenses into columns which decompose
via a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. At high pulse frequencies, the suspension
forms a kinetically arrested, system spanning network. We demonstrate the
degeneration of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability with increasing pulse
frequency.
