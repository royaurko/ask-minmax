We introduce a general method to count unlabeled combinatorial structures and
to efficiently generate them at random. The approach is based on pointing
unlabeled structures in an "unbiased" way that a structure of size n gives rise
to n pointed structures. We extend Polya theory to the corresponding pointing
operator, and present a random sampling framework based on both the principles
of Boltzmann sampling and on P\'olya operators. All previously known unlabeled
construction principles for Boltzmann samplers are special cases of our new
results. Our method is illustrated on several examples: in each case, we
provide enumerative results and efficient random samplers. The approach applies
to unlabeled families of plane and nonplane unrooted trees, and tree-like
structures in general, but also to families of graphs (such as cacti graphs and
outerplanar graphs) and families of planar maps.
