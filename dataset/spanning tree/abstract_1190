We consider large random trees under Gibbs distributions and prove a Large
Deviation Principle (LDP) for the distribution of degrees of vertices of the
tree. The LDP rate function is given explicitly. An immediate consequence is a
Law of Large Numbers for the distribution of vertex degrees in a large random
tree. Our motivation for this study comes from the analysis of RNA secondary
structures.
