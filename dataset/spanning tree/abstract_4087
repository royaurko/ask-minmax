Tree models for rigidity percolation are introduced and solved. A probability
vector describes the propagation of rigidity outward from a rigid border. All
components of this ``vector order parameter'' are singular at the same rigidity
threshold, $p_c$. The infinite-cluster probability $P_{\infty}$ is usually
first-order at $p_c$, but often behaves as $P_{\infty} \sim \Delta P_{\infty} +
(p-p_c)^{1/2}$, indicating critical fluctuations superimposed on a first order
jump. Our tree models for rigidity are in qualitative disagreement with
``constraint counting'' mean field theories. In an important sub-class of tree
models ``Bootstrap'' percolation and rigidity percolation are equivalent.
