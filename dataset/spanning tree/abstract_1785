This volume contains the papers that were presented at the second
international workshop on Trends in Tree Automata and Transducers (TTATT 2013)
which took place on October 19th, 2013 in Hanoi/Vietnam. The workshop was
colocated with the verification conference ATVA. The first edition of the
workshop was colocated with RTA and took place in Nagoya/Japan. The interest of
the workshop lies at the intersection of programming languages, verification,
and database theory, which are areas to which tree automata and transducers are
applied recently.
