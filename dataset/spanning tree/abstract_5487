We present a concise review of the recent important experimental developments
on neutrino mixing (hints for sterile neutrinos, large $\theta_{13}$, possible
non maximal $\theta_{23}$, approaching sensitivity on $\delta_{CP}$) and their
implications on models of neutrino mixing. The new data disfavour many models
but the surviving ones still span a wide range going from Anarchy (no
structure, no symmetry in the lepton sector) to a maximum of symmetry, as for
the models based on discrete non-abelian flavour groups.
