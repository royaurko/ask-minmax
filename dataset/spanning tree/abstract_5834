Knuth [12, Page 417] states that "the (program of the) Fibonaccian search
technique looks very mysterious at first glance" and that "it seems to work by
magic". In this work, we show that there is even more magic in Fibonaccian (or
else Fibonacci) search. We present a generalized Fibonacci procedure that
follows perfectly the implicit optimal decision tree for search problems where
the cost of each comparison depends on its outcome.
