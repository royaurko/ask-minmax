We study an infinite system of non-linear differential equations coupled in a
tree-like structure. This system was previously introduced in the literature
and it is the model from which the dyadic shell model of turbulence was
derived. It mimics 3d Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in a rough
approximation of a wavelet decomposition. We prove existence of finite energy
solutions, anomalous dissipation in the inviscid unforced case, existence and
uniqueness of stationary solutions (either conservative or not) in the forced
case.
