By computations on generating functions, Szekeres proved in 1983 that the law
of the diameter of a uniformly distributed rooted labelled tree with n
vertices, rescaled by a factor n^{1/2} , converges to a distribution whose
density is explicit. Aldous observed in 1991 that this limiting distribution is
the law of the diameter of the Brownian tree. In our article, we provide a
computation of this law which is directly based on the normalized Brownian
excursion. Moreover, we provide an explicit formula for the joint law of the
height and diameter of the Brownian tree, which is a new result.
