We give an expression of the speed of the biased random walk on a
Galton--Watson tree. In the particular case of the simple random walk, we
recover the result of Lyons, Pemantle and Peres \cite{LyPePe95}. The proof uses
a description of the invariant distribution of the environment seen from the
particle.
