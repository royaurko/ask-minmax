An automaton is universal if it accepts every possible input. We study the
notion of u-universality, which asserts that the automaton accepts every input
starting with u. Universality and u-universality are both EXPTIME-hard for
non-deterministic tree automata. We propose efficient antichain-based
techniques to address these problems for visibly pushdown automata operating on
trees. One of our approaches yields algorithms for the universality and
u-universality of hedge automata.
