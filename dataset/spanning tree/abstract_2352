It has been suggested that a Random Tree Puzzle (RTP) process leads to a
Yule-Harding (YH) distribution, when the number of taxa becomes large. In this
study, we formalize this conjecture, and we prove that the two tree
distributions converge for two particular properties, which suggests that the
conjecture may be true. However, we present evidence that, while the two
distributions are close, the RTP appears to converge on a different
distribution than does the YH.
