Inference problems in graphical models are often approximated by casting them
as constrained optimization problems. Message passing algorithms, such as
belief propagation, have previously been suggested as methods for solving these
optimization problems. However, there are few convergence guarantees for such
algorithms, and the algorithms are therefore not guaranteed to solve the
corresponding optimization problem. Here we present an oriented tree
decomposition algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum of
the Tree-Reweighted (TRW) variational problem. Our algorithm performs local
updates in the convex dual of the TRW problem - an unconstrained generalized
geometric program. Primal updates, also local, correspond to oriented
reparametrization operations that leave the distribution intact.
