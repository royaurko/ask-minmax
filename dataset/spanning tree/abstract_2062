We study the problem of constructing phylogenetic trees for a given set of
species. The problem is formulated as that of finding a minimum Steiner tree on
$n$ points over the Boolean hypercube of dimension $d$. It is known that an
optimal tree can be found in linear time if the given dataset has a perfect
phylogeny, i.e. cost of the optimal phylogeny is exactly $d$. Moreover, if the
data has a near-perfect phylogeny, i.e. the cost of the optimal Steiner tree is
$d+q$, it is known that an exact solution can be found in running time which is
polynomial in the number of species and $d$, yet exponential in $q$. In this
work, we give a polynomial-time algorithm (in both $d$ and $q$) that finds a
phylogenetic tree of cost $d+O(q^2)$. This provides the best guarantees known -
namely, a $(1+o(1))$-approximation - for the case $\log(d) \ll q \ll \sqrt{d}$,
broadening the range of settings for which near-optimal solutions can be
efficiently found. We also discuss the motivation and reasoning for studying
such additive approximations.
