Recently, Ehrenborg and Van Willenburg defined a class of bipartite graphs
that correspond naturally to Ferrers diagrams, and proved several results about
them. We give bijective proofs for the (already known) expressions for the
number of spanning trees and (where applicable) Hamiltonian paths of these
graphs.
