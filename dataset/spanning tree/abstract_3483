We compute the one-loop gluon amplitude for the open twistor string model of
Berkovits, using a symmetric form of the vertex operators. We discuss the
classical solutions in various topologies and instanton sectors and the
canonical quantization of the world sheet Lagrangian. We derive the N-point
functions for the gluon tree and one-loop amplitudes, and calculate a general
one-loop expression for the current algebra.
