The statistical analysis of tree structured data is a new topic in statistics
with wide application areas. Some Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ideas were
previously developed for binary tree spaces. In this study, we extend these
ideas to the more general space of rooted and labeled trees. We re-define
concepts such as tree-line and forward principal component tree-line for this
more general space, and generalize the optimal algorithm that finds them.
  We then develop an analog of classical dimension reduction technique in PCA
for the tree space. To do this, we define the components that carry the least
amount of variation of a tree data set, called backward principal components.
We present an optimal algorithm to find them. Furthermore, we investigate the
relationship of these the forward principal components, and prove a
path-independency property between the forward and backward techniques.
  We apply our methods to a data set of brain artery data set of 98 subjects.
Using our techniques, we investigate how aging affects the brain artery
structure of males and females. We also analyze a data set of organization
structure of a large US company and explore the structural differences across
different types of departments within the company.
