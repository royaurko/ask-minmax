We describe methods for the measurement of translational diffusion in very
large static magnetic field gradients by NMR. The techniques use a
"hole-burning" sequence that, with the use of fringe field gradients of 42 T/m,
can image diffusion along one dimension on a submicron scale. Two varieties of
this method are demonstrated, including a particularly efficient mode called
the "hole-comb," in which multiple diffusion times comprising an entire
diffusive evolution can be measured within the span of a single detected slice.
The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are discussed, as well as
their potential for addressing non-Fickian diffusion, diffusion in restricted
media, and spatially inhomogeneous diffusion.
