Motivated by a problem in complex dynamics, we examine the block structure of
the natural action of monodromy groups on the tree of preimages of a generic
point. We show that in many cases, including when the polynomial has prime
power degree, there are no large blocks other than those arising naturally from
the tree structure. However, using a method of construction based on real
graphs of polynomials, we exhibit a non-trivial example of a degree 6
polynomial failing to have this property. This example settles a problem raised
in a recent paper of the second contributor regarding constant weighted sums of
polynomials in the complex plane. We also show that degree 6 is exceptional in
another regard, as it is the lowest degree for which the monodromy group of a
polynomial is not determined by the combinatorics of the post-critical set.
These results give new applications of iterated monodromy groups to complex
dynamics.
