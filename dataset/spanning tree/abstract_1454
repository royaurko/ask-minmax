We study the behavior of Random Walk in Random Environment (RWRE) on trees in
the critical case left open in previous work. Representing the random walk by
an electrical network, we assume that the ratios of resistances of neighboring
edges of a tree Gamma are i.i.d.random variables whose logarithms have mean
zero and finite variance. Then the resulting RWRE is transient if simple random
walk on Gamma is transient, but not vice versa. We obtain general transience
criteria for such walks, which are sharp for symmetric trees of polynomial
growth. In order to prove these criteria, we establish results on boundary
crossing by tree-indexed random walks. These results rely on comparison
inequalities for percolation processes on trees and on some new estimates of
boundary crossing probabilities for ordinary mean-zero finite variance random
walks in one dimension, which are of independent interest.
