We describe a fast direct numerical simulation (DNS) method that promises to
directly characterise the hydraulic roughness of any given rough surface, from
the hydraulically smooth to the fully rough regime. The method circumvents the
unfavourable computational cost associated with simulating high-Reynolds-number
flows by employing minimal-span channels (Jimenez & Moin 1991).
Proof-of-concept simulations demonstrate that flows in minimal-span channels
are sufficient for capturing the downward velocity shift, that is, the Hama
roughness function, predicted by flows in full-span channels. We consider two
sets of simulations, first with modelled roughness imposed by body forces, and
second with explicit roughness described by roughness-conforming grids. Owing
to the minimal cost, we are able to conduct DNSs with increasing roughness
Reynolds numbers while maintaining a fixed blockage ratio, as is typical in
full-scale applications. The present method promises a practical, fast and
accurate tool for characterising hydraulic resistance directly from
profilometry data of rough surfaces.
