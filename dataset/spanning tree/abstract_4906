This article studies methods to obtain relations for scattering amplitudes at
the loop level, with concrete examples at one loop. These methods originate in
the analysis of large so-called Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten shifts of tree level
amplitudes and loop level integrands. In particular BCFW shifts for particles
which are not color adjacent and some particular generalizations of this
situation are analyzed in some detail in four and higher dimensions. For
generic non-adjacent shifts our results are independent of loop order for
integrands and hold for generic minimally coupled gauge theories with possible
scalar potential and Yukawa terms. By a standard argument this result indicates
a generalization of the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations for tree level
amplitudes exists to the integrand at all loop levels. A concrete relation is
presented at one loop. Furthermore, inspired by results in QED it is shown that
the results on generalized BCFW shifts of tree level amplitudes imply relations
for the so-called rational, bubble and triangle terms of one loop amplitudes in
pure Yang-Mills theory. Bubble and triangle terms for instance are shown to
obey a five photon decoupling identity, while a three photon decoupling
identity is demonstrated for the rational terms. Along the same lines recently
conjectured relations for helicity equal amplitudes at one loop are shown to
generalize to helicity independent relations for the massive box coefficient of
the rational terms.
