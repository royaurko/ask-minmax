We study the structure and growth of a difusion-limited aggregate (DLA) for
which the constitutive units remain mobile during the aggregation process.
Contrary to DLA where far from equilibrium conditions are the prevalent factor
for growth, the structure of the aggregate is here determined by a combination
of annealed and quenched processes. The internal flexibility allows the
aggregate to span the equilibrium configurational space, and such thermally
driven motion further modifies the connectivity statistics of the growing
branched structure.
