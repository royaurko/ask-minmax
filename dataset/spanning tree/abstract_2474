Algorithms are given for determining $L_\infty$ isotonic regression of
weighted data where the independent set is n vertices in multidimensional space
or in a rooted tree. For a linear order, or, more generally, a grid in
multidimensional space, an optimal algorithm is given, taking $\Theta(n)$ time.
For vertices at arbitrary locations in d-dimensional space a $\Theta(n
\log^{d-1} n)$ algorithm employs iterative sorting to yield the functionality
of a multidimensional structure while using only $\Theta(n)$ space. A
$\Theta(n)$ time algorithm is also given for rooted trees. These improve upon
previous algorithms by $\Omega(\log n)$. The algorithms utilize a new
non-constructive feasibility test on a rendezvous graph, with bounded error
envelopes at each vertex.
