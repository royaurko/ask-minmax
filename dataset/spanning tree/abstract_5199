Nucleon total reaction and neutron total cross sections to 300 MeV for 12C
and 208Pb, and for 65 MeV spanning the mass range, are predicted using
coordinate space optical potentials formed by full folding of effective
nucleon-nucleon interactions with realistic nuclear ground state densities.
Good to excellent agreement is found with existing data.
