We argue that the resource sharing that is commonly manifest in semantic
accounts of coordination is instead appropriately handled in terms of
structure-sharing in LFG f-structures. We provide an extension to the previous
account of LFG semantics (Dalrymple et al., 1993b) according to which
dependencies between f-structures are viewed as resources; as a result a
one-to-one correspondence between uses of f-structures and meanings is
maintained. The resulting system is sufficiently restricted in cases where
other approaches overgenerate; the very property of resource-sensitivity for
which resource sharing appears to be problematic actually provides explanatory
advantages over systems that more freely replicate resources during derivation.
