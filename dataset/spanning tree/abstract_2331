It is known that there is a Hopf algebra structure on the vector space with
basis all heap-ordered trees. We give a new bialgebra structure on the space
with basis all permutations and show that there is a direct bialgebra
isomorphism between the Hopf algebra of heap-ordered trees and the bialgebra of
permutations.
