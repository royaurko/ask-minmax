We show that in gauge mediation models with tree level R-symmetry breaking
where supersymmetry and R-symmetries are broken by different fields, the
gaugino mass either vanishes or finds contribution from loop level R-symmetry
breaking. Thus tree-level R-symmetry breaking is either no-go or redundant for
phenomenology model building.
