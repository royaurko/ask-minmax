Using a portfolio of stocks from the London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index
(FTSE), we study both the time dependence of their correlations and the
normalized tree length of the associated minimal spanning tree (MST). The first
four moments of the distribution of correlations and lengths of the tree are
examined in detail and differences in behaviour noted. For different economic
groups and industries, clustering is evident. However comparing the
classification used prior to 2006 with that introduced in January 2006 it is
clear that the new classification, apart from one or two notable exceptions, is
much more compatible with the clustering obtained by the MST analysis. We
finally compare the MST for real data with that obtained for a synthetic {\it
random market}. The latter tree would seem more like the structure found by
Coronnello {\it et al.} for trees based on high frequency data.
