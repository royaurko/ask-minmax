In this paper, we study factorizations of cycles. The main result is that
under certain condition, the number of ways to factor a $d$-cycle into a
product of cycles of prescribed lengths is $d^{r-2}.$ To prove our result, we
first define a new class of combinatorial objects, multi-noded rooted trees,
which generalize rooted trees. We find the cardinality of this new class which
with proper parameters is exactly $d^{r-2}.$ The main part of this paper is the
proof that there is a bijection from factorizations of a $d$-cycle to
multi-noded rooted trees via factorization graphs. This implies the desired
formula.
  The factorization problem we consider has its origin in geometry, and is
related to the study of a special family of Hurwitz numbers: pure-cycle Hurwitz
numbers. Via the standard translation of Hurwitz numbers into group theory, our
main result is equivalent to the following: when the genus is $0$ and one of
the ramification indices is $d,$ the degree of the covers, the pure-cycle
Hurwitz number is $d^{r-3},$ where $r$ is the number of branch points.
