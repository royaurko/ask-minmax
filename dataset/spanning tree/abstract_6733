We identify a hidden GL(n,C) symmetry of the tree level n-point MHV gravity
amplitude. Representations of this symmetry reside in an auxiliary n-space
whose indices are external particle labels. Spinor helicity variables transform
non-linearly under GL(n,C), but linearly under its notable subgroups, the
little group and the permutation group S_n. Using GL(n,C) covariant variables,
we present a new and simple formula for the MHV amplitude which can be derived
solely from geometric constraints. This expression carries a huge intrinsic
redundancy which can be parameterized by a pair of reference 3-planes in
n-space. Fixing this redundancy in a particular way, we reproduce the S_{n-3}
symmetric form of the MHV amplitude of [1], which is in turn equivalent to the
S_{n-2} symmetric form of [2] as a consequence of the matrix tree theorem. The
redundancy of the amplitude can also be fixed in a way that fully preserves
S_n, yielding new and manifestly S_n symmetric forms of the MHV amplitude.
Remarkably, these expressions need not be manifestly homogenous in spinorial
weight or mass dimension. We comment on possible extensions to N^{k-2}MHV
amplitudes and speculate on the deeper origins of GL(n,C).
