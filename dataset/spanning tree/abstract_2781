In this note we consider both the local maximal out-degree and the global
maximal out-degree of Galton-Watson trees. In particular, we show that the tail
of any local maximal out-degree and that of the offspring distribution are
asymptotically of the same order. However for the global maximal out-degree,
this is only true in the subcritical case.
