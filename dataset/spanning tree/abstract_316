We present an integrated approach to structure and parameter estimation in
latent tree graphical models, where some nodes are hidden. Our overall approach
follows a "divide-and-conquer" strategy that learns models over small groups of
variables and iteratively merges into a global solution. The structure learning
involves combinatorial operations such as minimum spanning tree construction
and local recursive grouping; the parameter learning is based on the method of
moments and on tensor decompositions. Our method is guaranteed to correctly
recover the unknown tree structure and the model parameters with low sample
complexity for the class of linear multivariate latent tree models which
includes discrete and Gaussian distributions, and Gaussian mixtures. Our bulk
asynchronous parallel algorithm is implemented in parallel using the OpenMP
framework and scales logarithmically with the number of variables and linearly
with dimensionality of each variable. Our experiments confirm a high degree of
efficiency and accuracy on large datasets of electronic health records. The
proposed algorithm also generates intuitive and clinically meaningful disease
hierarchies.
