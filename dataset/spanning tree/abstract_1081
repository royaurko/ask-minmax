Spanning sets for vertex operator algebras satisfying difference-zero and
difference-one conditions have been extensively studied in the recent years. In
this paper, we extend these results. More specifically, we show that for a
suitably chosen generating set, any N-graded Moebius vertex algebra is spanned
by monomials satisfying a difference-N ordering condition.
