Consider an infinite tree with random degrees, i.i.d. over the sites, with a
prescribed probability distribution with generating function G(s). We consider
the following variation of Renyi's parking problem, alternatively called
blocking RSA: at every vertex of the tree a particle (or car) arrives with rate
one. The particle sticks to the vertex whenever the vertex and all of its
nearest neighbors are not occupied yet. We provide an explicit expression for
the so-called parking constant in terms of the generating function.
