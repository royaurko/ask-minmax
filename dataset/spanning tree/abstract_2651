The notion of transducer integer sequences is considered through a series of
examples. By definition, transducer integer sequences are integer sequences
produced, under a suitable interpretation, by finite automata encoding tree
morphisms (length and prefix preserving transformations of words). Transducer
integer sequences are related to the notion of self-similar groups and
semigroups, as well as to the notion of automatic sequences.
