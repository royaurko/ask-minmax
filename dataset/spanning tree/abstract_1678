In this paper, we present a probabilistic self-balancing dictionary data
structure for massive data sets, and prove expected amortized I/O-optimal
bounds on the dictionary operations. We show how to use the structure as an
I/O-optimal priority queue. The data structure, which we call as the random
buffer tree, abstracts the properties of the random treap and the buffer tree
and has the same expected I/O-bounds as the buffer tree.
