Given an undirected graph $G$ of $n$ weighted edges, stored one edge per
processor in a square mesh of $n$ processors, we show how to determine the
connected components and a minimal spanning forest in $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ time.
More generally, we show how to solve these problems in $\Theta(n^{1/d})$ time
when the mesh is a $d$-dimensional cube, where the implied constants depend
upon $d$.
