We show that the integrality gap of the natural LP relaxation of the
Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem is $\text{polyloglog}(n)$. In other
words, there is a polynomial time algorithm that approximates the value of the
optimum tour within a factor of $\text{polyloglog}(n)$, where
$\text{polyloglog}(n)$ is a bounded degree polynomial of $\log\log(n)$. We
prove this by showing that any $k$-edge-connected unweighted graph has a
$\text{polyloglog}(n)/k$-thin spanning tree.
  Our main new ingredient is a procedure, albeit an exponentially sized convex
program, that "transforms" graphs that do not admit any spectrally thin trees
into those that provably have spectrally thin trees. More precisely, given a
$k$-edge-connected graph $G=(V,E)$ where $k\geq 7\log(n)$, we show that there
is a matrix $D$ that "preserves" the structure of all cuts of $G$ such that for
a set $F\subseteq E$ that induces an $\Omega(k)$-edge-connected graph, the
effective resistance of every edge in $F$ w.r.t. $D$ is at most
$\text{polylog}(k)/k$. Then, we use a recent extension of the seminal work of
Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava [MSS13] by the contributors [AO14] to prove the
existence of a $\text{polylog}(k)/k$-spectrally thin tree with respect to $D$.
Such a tree is $\text{polylog}(k)/k$-combinatorially thin with respect to $G$
as $D$ preserves the structure of cuts of $G$.
