We study the size properties of a general model of fractal sets that are
based on a tree-indexed family of random compacts and a tree-indexed Markov
chain. These fractals may be regarded as a generalization of those resulting
from the Moran-like deterministic or random recursive constructions considered
by various contributors. Among other applications, we consider various extensions of
Mandelbrot's fractal percolation process.
