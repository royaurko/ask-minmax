This paper proves the reconstruction conjecture for graphs which are
isomorphic to the cube of a tree. The proof uses the reconstructibility of
trees from their peripheral vertex deleted subgraphs. The main result follows
from (i) characterization of the cube of a tree (ii) recognizability of the
cube of a tree (iii) uniqueness of tree as a cube root of a graph G, except
when G is a complete graph (iv) reconstructibility of trees from their
peripheral vertex deleted subgraphs.
