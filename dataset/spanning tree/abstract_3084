We study a dual version of online edge coloring, where the goal is to color
as many edges as possible using only a given number, $k$, of available colors.
All of our results are with regard to competitive analysis. For paths, we
consider $k=2$, and for trees, we consider any $k \geq 2$. We prove that a
natural greedy algorithm called First-Fit is optimal among deterministic
algorithms on paths as well as trees. This is the first time that an optimal
algorithm for online dual edge coloring has been identified for a class of
graphs. For paths, we give a randomized algorithm, which is optimal and better
than the best possible deterministic algorithm. Again, it is the first time
that this has been done for a class of graphs. For trees, we also show that
even randomized algorithms cannot be much better than First-Fit.
