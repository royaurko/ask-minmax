We present a simple yet rigorous approach to the determination of the
spectral dimension of random trees, based on the study of the massless limit of
the Gaussian model on such trees. As a byproduct, we obtain evidence in favor
of a new scaling hypothesis for the Gaussian model on generic bounded graphs
and in favor of a previously conjectured exact relation between spectral and
connectivity dimensions on more general tree-like structures.
