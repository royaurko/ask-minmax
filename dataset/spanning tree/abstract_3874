We study sequences of analytic conjugacy classes of rational maps which
diverge in moduli space. In particular, we are interested in the notion of
rescaling limits introduced by Jan Kiwi. In the continuity of [A1] we recall
the notion of dynamical covers between trees of spheres for which a periodic
sphere corresponds to a rescaling limit. We study necessary conditions for such
a dynamical cover to be the limit of dynamically marked rational maps. With
these conditions we classify them for the case of bicritical maps and we
recover the second main result of Jan Kiwi regarding rescaling limits.
