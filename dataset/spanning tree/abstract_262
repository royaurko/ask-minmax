It is conjectured that the Khovanov homology of a knot is invariant under
mutation. In this paper, we review the spanning tree complex for Khovanov
homology, and reformulate this conjecture using a matroid obtained from the
Tait graph (checkerboard graph) G of a knot diagram K. The spanning trees of G
provide a filtration and a spectral sequence that converges to the reduced
Khovanov homology of K. We show that the E_2-term of this spectral sequence is
a matroid invariant and hence invariant under mutation.
