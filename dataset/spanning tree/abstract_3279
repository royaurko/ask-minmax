We study intertwining operators among the twisted modules for rational VOAs
and show the modular invariance property of the space spanned by the trace
functions concerning to some representations of rational orbifold VOAs. Our
result generalizes the results obtained by Dong-Li-Mason and Miyamoto, which
are basically extensions of Zhu's celebrated works.
