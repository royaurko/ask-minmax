Motivated by the experimental data, we study charmless $B_{u,d,s}\to VT$ ($V$
and $T$ denote light vector and tensor mesons respectively) decays in the
perturbative QCD approach. The predictions of branching ratios, polarization
fractions and direct CP violations are given in detail. Specifically, within
this approach we have calculated the polarization fractions and the branching
ratios of $B\to \phi(K_2^{*-}, \bar K_2^{*0})$ which agree well with the
observed experimental data, however the branching ratios of $B\to
\omega(K_2^{*-}, \bar K_2^{*0})$ are hard to be explained, where the
polarization fractions are well accommodated. The tree dominated channels with
a vector meson emitted have longitudinal polarization fraction of 90%, while
the penguin dominating ones have subtle polarization fractions. Fortunately,
most branching ratios of $B_{u,d}$ decays are of the order $10^{-6}$, which
would be straight forward for experimental observations. For the $B_s$ decays
the branching ratios can reach the order of $10^{-6}$ in tree dominated decays,
while in penguin dominated decays those are of order of $10^{-7}$ which require
more experimental data to be observed.
