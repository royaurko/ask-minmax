We show that the poset of non-trivial partitions of 1,2,...,n has a
fundamental homology class with coefficients in a Lie superalgebra. Homological
duality then rapidly yields a range of known results concerning the integral
representations of the symmetric groups S_n and S_{n+1} on the homology and
cohomology of this partially-ordered set.
