A variant of Turing machines is introduced where the tape is replaced by a
single tree which can be manipulated in a style akin to purely functional
programming. This yields two benefits: first, the extra structure on the tape
can be leveraged to write explicit constructions of machines much more easily
than with Turing machines. Second, this new kind of machines models finely the
asymptotic complexity of functional programming languages, and may allow to
answer questions such as "is this problem inherently slower in functional
languages".
