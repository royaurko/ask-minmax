We consider a random tree and introduce a metric in the space of trees to
define the ``mean tree'' as the tree minimizing the average distance to the
random tree. When the resulting metric space is compact we have laws of large
numbers and central limit theorems for sequence of independent identically
distributed random trees. As application we propose tests to check if two
samples of random trees have the same law.
