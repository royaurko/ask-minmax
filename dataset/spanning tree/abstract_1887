A long-term study of the elements Mg, Al, Si, P, Ca, S, Cl, Fe and Mn in
leaves is in progress. The objective of this study is to develop a week-by-week
profile of these elements in leaves during several growing seasons. The profile
includes the following information: (1) Which elements each tree collects in
its leaves. (2) The location in the leaf with the highest concentration, top
side, under side or interior. (3) The week during the growing season when each
element first appears in the leaves of each tree. (4) The change in the
relative concentration from week to week. (5) The source of the element i.e.,
deposition from the atmosphere or the root system of the tree. This information
is profile for each year and will be correlated with environmental conditions
for that year. Leaves are collected weekly from first unfolding in early spring
until leaf drop in the fall. They are from the 31 trees and 26 species in
Broome County, NY. From time to time leaves from most of the 26 species are
being randomly collected from trees growing throughout the northeastern US.
