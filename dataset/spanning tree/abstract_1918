We propose a hybrid algorithmic strategy for complex stochastic optimization
problems, which combines the use of scenario trees from multistage stochastic
programming with machine learning techniques for learning a policy in the form
of a statistical model, in the context of constrained vector-valued decisions.
Such a policy allows one to run out-of-sample simulations over a large number
of independent scenarios, and obtain a signal on the quality of the
approximation scheme used to solve the multistage stochastic program. We
propose to apply this fast simulation technique to choose the best tree from a
set of scenario trees. A solution scheme is introduced, where several scenario
trees with random branching structure are solved in parallel, and where the
tree from which the best policy for the true problem could be learned is
ultimately retained. Numerical tests show that excellent trade-offs can be
achieved between run times and solution quality.
