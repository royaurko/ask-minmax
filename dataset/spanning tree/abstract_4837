Zeros of the moment of the partition function $[Z^n]_{\bm{J}}$ with respect
to complex $n$ are investigated in the zero temperature limit $\beta \to
\infty$, $n\to 0$ keeping $y=\beta n \approx O(1)$. We numerically investigate
the zeros of the $\pm J$ Ising spin glass models on several Cayley trees and
hierarchical lattices and compare those results. In both lattices, the
calculations are carried out with feasible computational costs by using
recursion relations originated from the structures of those lattices. The
results for Cayley trees show that a sequence of the zeros approaches the real
axis of $y$ implying that a certain type of analyticity breaking actually
occurs, although it is irrelevant for any known replica symmetry breaking. The
result of hierarchical lattices also shows the presence of analyticity
breaking, even in the two dimensional case in which there is no
finite-temperature spin-glass transition, which implies the existence of the
zero-temperature phase transition in the system. A notable tendency of
hierarchical lattices is that the zeros spread in a wide region of the complex
$y$ plane in comparison with the case of Cayley trees, which may reflect the
difference between the mean-field and finite-dimensional systems.
