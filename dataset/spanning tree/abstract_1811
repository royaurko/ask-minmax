This paper contains a classification of all countable lower 1-transitive
linear orders. The notion of lower 1-transitivity generalises that of
1-transitivity for linear orders, and is essential for the structure theory of
1-transitive trees. The classification is given in terms of coding trees. These
describe how a linear order is fabricated from simpler pieces using
concatenations, lexicographic products and other kinds of construction. We show
that a coding tree can be recovered from a lower 1-transitive linear order by
examining all the invariant partitions on the linear order.
