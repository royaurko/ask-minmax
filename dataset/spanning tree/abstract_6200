We calculate the $O(\alpha m_t^2/m^2_W)$ corrections arising from diagrams
involving the top-quark loops to the light neutral Higgs boson production via
$q\bar q'\to WH$ at the Fermilab Tevatron in both the standard model and the
minimal supersymmetric model. In contrast to the QCD correction which increases
the tree-level cross section, the corrections imply a few percent reduction in
the production cross section relative to the tree-leve results.
