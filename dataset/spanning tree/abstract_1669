Let g be a simple Lie algebra of rank n over C. We show that the
n-dimensional abelian ideals of a Borel subalgebra of g are limits of Jordan
Lie subalgebras. Combining this with a classical result by Kostant, we show
that the g-module spanned by all n-dimensional abelian Lie subalgebras of g is
actually spanned by the Jordan Lie subalgebras.
