We derive bounds on nine dimension-six operators involving electroweak gauge
bosons and the Higgs boson from precision electroweak data. Four of these
operators contribute at tree level, and five contribute only at one loop. Using
the full power of effective field theory, we show that the bounds on the five
loop-level operators are much weaker than previously claimed, and thus much
weaker than bounds from tree-level processes at high-energy colliders.
