Phylogenetic trees describe the evolutionary history of a group of
present-day species from a common ancestor. These trees are typically
reconstructed from aligned DNA sequence data. In this paper we analytically
address the following question: is the amount of sequence data required to
accurately reconstruct a tree significantly more than the amount required to
test whether or not a candidate tree was the `true' tree? By `significantly',
we mean that the two quantities behave the same way as a function of the number
of species being considered. We prove that, for a certain type of model, the
amount of information required is not significantly different; while for
another type of model, the information required to test a tree is independent
of the number of leaves, while that required to reconstruct it grows with this
number. Our results combine probabilistic and combinatorial arguments.
