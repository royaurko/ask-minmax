In this work we introduce and study various generalizations of the notion of
increasingly labelled trees, where the label of a child node is always larger
than the label of its parent node, to multilabelled tree families, where the
nodes in the tree can get multiple labels. For all tree classes we show
characterizations of suitable generating functions for the tree enumeration
sequence via differential equations. Furthermore, for several combinatorial
classes of multilabelled increasing tree families we present explicit
enumeration results. We also present multilabelled increasing tree families of
an elliptic nature, where the exponential generating function can be expressed
in terms of the Weierstrass-p function or the lemniscate sine function.
Furthermore, we show how to translate enumeration formulas for multilabelled
increasing trees into hook-length formulas for trees and present a general
"reverse engineering" method to discover hook-length formulas associated to
such tree families.
