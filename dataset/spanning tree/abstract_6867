The Phylogenetic Genome Annotator (PGA) is a computer program that enables
real-time comparison of 'gene trees' versus 'species trees' obtained from
predicted open reading frames of whole genome data. The gene phylogenies are
inferred for each individual genome predicted proteins whereas the species
phylogenies are inferred from rDNA data. The correlated protein domains,
defined by PFAM, are then displayed side-by-side with a phylogeny of the
corresponding species. The statistical support of gene clusters (branches) is
given by the quartet puzzling method. This analysis readily discriminates
paralogs from orthologs, enabling the identification of proteins originated by
gene duplications and the prediction of possible functional divergence in
groups of similar sequences.
