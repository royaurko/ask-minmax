Unlike wired networks, the capacity of a wireless network is interference
limited due to the broadcast nature of wireless medium. Some multicast wireless
network protocols do not consider channel assignment issue, that they cause
interference at transmission nodes, hence do not use full capacity of the
network. Interference can be reduced and throughput improved with the use of
multichannel features. Therefore, this paper used orthogonal channels for
sending and receiving nodes in the network. We propose EWM (Efficient Wireless
Multicast) method that is distributed scheme for constructing multicast tree in
multi-channel multi-interface wireless mesh networks (MIMC-WMN) which selects
relay nodes and in distributed form assign orthogonal radio channels to them.
To more decrease of interference in adding a branch to the tree, the route with
minimum end-to-end delay from the source to the multicast receiver will be
chosen. Thus, the tree is suitable for multimedia applicants. We also employ
the broadcast nature of the wireless media to reduce the number of relay nodes.
The proposed algorithm is compared with MCM algorithm in NS2.
