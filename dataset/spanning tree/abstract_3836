In this paper, we study the concept of free pre-Lie algebra generated by a
(non-empty) set. We review the construction of A. Agrachev and R. Gamkrelidze
of monomial bases in free pre-Lie algebras. We describe the matrix of the
monomial basis vectors in terms of the rooted trees basis exhibited by F.
Chapoton and M. Livernet. We also show that this matrix is unipotent and we
find an explicit expression for its coefficients.
