Let $\mathcal{T}_{q+1}$ be the $q+1$-regular tree and let $G$ be a group of
autormophisms acting transitively on the vertices and on the boundary of
$\mathcal{T}_{q+1}$. We give an upper bound for the growth of cocycles with
values in any unitary representation of the group $G$. This bound is optimal by
projecting the Haagerup cocycle onto the subspace of the kernel of the
divergence. We also obtain a description of functions conditionally of negative
type which are unbounded.
