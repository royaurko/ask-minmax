The properties of the entanglement entropy (EE) of a clean Cayley tree (CT)
are studied. The EE shows a completely different behaviour depending on the way
the CT is partitioned into two regions and whether we consider the ground-state
or highly excited many-particle wave function. The ground-state EE increases
logarithmically as function of number of generation if a single branch is
pruned off the tree, while it grows exponentially if the region around the root
is trimmed. On the other hand, in both cases the highly excited states' EE
grows exponentially. Implications of these results to general graphs and
disordered systems are shortly discussed.
