The clique-width is a measure of complexity of decomposing graphs into
certain tree-like structures. The class of graphs with bounded clique-width
contains bounded tree-width graphs. While there are many results on the graph
isomorphism problem for bounded tree-width graphs, very little is known about
isomorphism of bounded clique-width graphs. We give the first polynomial-time
graph isomorphism algorithm for graphs with clique-width at most 3.
