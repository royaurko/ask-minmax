We provide simplified proofs for the asymptotic distribution of the number of
cuts required to cut down a Galton-Watson tree with critical, finite-variance
offspring distribution, conditioned to have total progeny $n$. Our proof is
based on a coupling which yields a precise, nonasymptotic distributional result
for the case of uniformly random rooted labeled trees (or, equivalently,
Poisson Galton-Watson trees conditioned on their size). Our approach also
provides a new, random reversible transformation between Brownian excursion and
Brownian bridge.
