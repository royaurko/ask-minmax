We prove that there are groups in the constructible universe whose
automorphism towers are highly malleable by forcing. This is a consequence of
the fact that, under a suitable diamond hypothesis, there are sufficiently many
highly rigid non-isomorphic Souslin trees whose isomorphism relation can be
precisely controlled by forcing.
