The paper is concerned with the space of the marked Schreier graphs of the
Grigorchuk group and the action of the group on this space. In particular, we
describe an invariant set of the Schreier graphs corresponding to the action on
the boundary of the binary rooted tree and dynamics of the group action
restricted to this invariant set.
