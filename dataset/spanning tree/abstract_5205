Calculations of nuclear masses, using nuclear density functional theory, are
presented for even-even nuclei spanning the nuclear chart. The resulting
binding energy differences can be interpreted in terms of valence
proton-neutron interactions. These are compared globally, regionally, and
locally with empirical values. Overall, excellent agreement is obtained.
Discrepancies highlight neglected degrees of freedom and can point to improved
density functionals.
