We prove the kernel estimates related to subordinated semigroups on
homogeneous trees. We study the long time propagation problem. We exploit this
to show exit time estimates for (large) balls. We use an abstract setting of
metric measure spaces. This enables us to give these results for trees end
hyperbolic spaces as well. Finally, we show some estimates for the Poisson
kernel of a ball.
