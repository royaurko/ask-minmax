We present results for masses of excited baryons from a quenched calculation
with Chirally Improved quarks at pion masses down to 350 MeV. Our analysis of
the correlators is based on the variational method. In order to provide a large
basis set for spanning the physical states, we use interpolators with different
Dirac structures and Jacobi smeared quark sources of different width. Our
spectroscopy results for a wide range of ground state and excited baryons are
discussed.
