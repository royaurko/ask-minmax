V473 Lyrae is a peculiar Galactic Cepheid, showing strong amplitude
modulation that resembles the Blazhko-effect observed in RR Lyrae stars. We
collected data spanning several modulation cycles and started a detailed
analysis. The first results indicate that the star shows both amplitude and
phase modulations with an average period of 1204 days, but both the cycle
length and the strength of the modulation are subjected to considerable
variations. A possible quintuplet component in the Fourier spectrum and
additional period changes were also detected.
