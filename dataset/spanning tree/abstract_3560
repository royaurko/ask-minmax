In genome rearrangement theory, one of the elusive questions raised in recent
years is the enumeration of rearrangement scenarios between two genomes. This
problem is related to the uniform generation of rearrangement scenarios, and
the derivation of tests of statistical significance of the properties of these
scenarios. Here we give an exact formula for the number of double-cut-and-join
(DCJ) rearrangement scenarios of co-tailed genomes. We also construct effective
bijections between the set of scenarios that sort a cycle and well studied
combinatorial objects such as parking functions and labeled trees.
