The max-algebraic core of a nonnegative matrix is the intersection of column
spans of all max-algebraic matrix powers. Here we investigate the action of a
matrix on its core. Being closely related to ultimate periodicity of matrix
powers, this study leads us to new modifications and geometric
characterizations of robust, orbit periodic and weakly stable matrices.
