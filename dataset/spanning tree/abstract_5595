The aim of this note is to show that lamplighter graphs where the space graph
is infinite and at most two-ended and the lamp graph is at most two-ended do
not admit harmonic functions with gradient in $\ell^p$ (i.e. finite $p$-energy)
for any $p \in [1,\infty[$ except constants (and, equivalently, that their
reduced $\ell^p$ cohomology is trivial in degree one). The proof relies on a
theorem of Thomassen on spanning lines in squares of graphs.
