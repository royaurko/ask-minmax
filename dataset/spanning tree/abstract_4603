Shape-dependent universal crossing probabilities are studied, via Monte Carlo
simulations, for bond and site directed percolation on the square lattice in
the diagonal direction, at the percolation threshold. Since the system is
strongly anisotropic, the shape-dependence enters through the effective aspect
ratio r_eff=cL^z/t, where c is a non-universal constant and z the anisotropy
exponent. A particular attention is paid to the influence of the initial state
on the universal behaviour of the crossing probability. Using anisotropic
finite-size scaling and generalizing a simple argument given by Aizenman for
isotropic percolation, we obtain the behaviour of the probability to find n
incipient spanning clusters on a finite system at time t. The numerical results
are in good agreement with the conjecture.
