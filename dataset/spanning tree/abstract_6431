In minimal left-right symmetric models, the mass of the neutral Higgs field
mediating tree-level flavor changing effects (FCNH) is directly related to the
parity breaking scale. Specifically, the lower bound on the Higgs mass coming
from Higgs-induced tree-level effects, and exceeding about 15 TeV, would tend
to imply a W_R mass bound much higher than that required by gauge exchange loop
effects -- the latter allowing W_R masses as low as 2.5 TeV. Since a W_R mass
below 4 TeV is accessible at the LHC, it is important to investigate ways to
decouple the FCNH effects from the W_R mass. In this paper, we present a model
where this happens, providing new motivation for LHC searches for W_R in the 1
- 4 TeV mass range.
