Motivated by a recent work of Tr\"umper we consider the general Collatz word
(up-down pattern) and the sequences following this pattern. The recurrences for
the first and last sequence entries are given, obtained from repeated
application of the general solution of a binary linear inhomogeneous
Diophantine equation. These recurrences are then solved. The Collatz tree is
also discussed.
