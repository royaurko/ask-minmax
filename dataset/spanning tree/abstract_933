In this paper, we investigate the structures of an extremal tree which has
the minimal number of subtrees in the set of all trees with the given degree
sequence of a tree. In particular, the extremal trees must be caterpillar and
but in general not unique. Moreover, all extremal trees with a given degree
sequence $\pi=(d_1, ..., d_5, 1,..., 1)$ have been characterized.
