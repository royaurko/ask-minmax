A graph $G$ is sparse if for every $X\subseteq V(G)$ with $|X|\ge 2$, the
number of edges induced by $X$ is at most $2|X|-3$. We prove a characterization
of graphs that can be decomposed to sparse subgraphs, which extends the
well-known result of Nash-Williams on decomposing graphs into forests. As an
application, we show that if $\gamma_2(G)\le k+1$ and $k+1\le l\le 2k+2$, then
$G$ decomposes into $l$ forests and $2k+2-l$ subgraphs with maximum degree at
most $(2|V(G)|-5)/3$, which strengthens the Weaker Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture
\cite{MORZ12} when $\gamma(G)$ is close to $2k+2$.
  We also provide partition conditions for a graph with edge-disjoint spanning
rigid subgraphs and spanning trees. In particular, we prove that every $[3k+l,
k]$-partition-connected graph with multiplicity at most $k$ contains
edge-disjoint $k$ spanning rigid subgraphs and $l$ spanning trees. As a
corollary, every $(6k+2l, 2k)$-connected graph with multiplicity at most $k$
contains edge-disjoint $k$ spanning rigid subgraphs and $l$ spanning trees,
which is a multigraph version of a theorem of Cheriyan, Durand de Gevigney and
Szigeti \cite{ChGS14}.
