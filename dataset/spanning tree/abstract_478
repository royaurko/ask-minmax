Motivated by privacy preservation for outsourced data, data-oblivious
external memory is a computational framework where a client performs
computations on data stored at a semi-trusted server in a way that does not
reveal her data to the server. This approach facilitates collaboration and
reliability over traditional frameworks, and it provides privacy protection,
even though the server has full access to the data and he can monitor how it is
accessed by the client. The challenge is that even if data is encrypted, the
server can learn information based on the client data access pattern; hence,
access patterns must also be obfuscated. We investigate privacy-preserving
algorithms for outsourced external memory that are based on the use of
data-oblivious algorithms, that is, algorithms where each possible sequence of
data accesses is independent of the data values. We give new efficient
data-oblivious algorithms in the outsourced external memory model for a number
of fundamental graph problems. Our results include new data-oblivious
external-memory methods for constructing minimum spanning trees, performing
various traversals on rooted trees, answering least common ancestor queries on
trees, computing biconnected components, and forming open ear decompositions.
None of our algorithms make use of constant-time random oracles.
