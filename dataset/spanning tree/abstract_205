Two basic approaches to the cluster counting task in the percolation and
related models are discussed. The Hoshen-Kopelman multiple labeling technique
for cluster statistics is redescribed. Modifications for random and aperiodic
lattices are sketched as well as some parallelised versions of the algorithm
are mentioned. The graph-theoretical basis for the spanning tree approaches is
given by describing the "breadth-first search" and "depth-first search"
procedures. Examples are given for extracting the elastic and geometric
"backbone" of a percolation cluster. An implementation of the "pebble game"
algorithm using a depth-first search method is also described.
