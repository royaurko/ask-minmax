We provide conditions that classify cover times for sequences of random walks
on random graphs into two types: One type (Type 1) is the class of cover times
that are of the order of the maximal hitting times scaled by the logarithm of
the size of vertex sets. The other type (Type 2) is the class of cover times
that are of the order of the maximal hitting times. The conditions are
described by some parameters determined by the underlying graphs: the volumes,
the diameters with respect to the resistance metric, the coverings or packings
by balls in the resistance metric. We apply the conditions to and classify a
number of examples, such as supercritical Galton-Watson trees, the incipient
infinite cluster of a critical Galton-Watson tree and the Sierpinski gasket
graph.
