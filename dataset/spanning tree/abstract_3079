We continue our study of the full set of translation-invariant splitting
Gibbs measures (TISGMs, translation-invariant tree-indexed Markov chains) for
the $q$-state Potts model on the Cayley tree. In our previous work we gave the
full description of the TISGMs, and showed in particular that at sufficiently
low temperatures their number is $2^{q}-1$. In this paper we find some regions
for the temperature parameter ensuring that a given TISGM is (non-)extreme in
the set of all Gibbs measures. In particular we show the existence of a
temperature interval for which there are at least $2^{q-1} + q$ extremal
TISGMs. For the Cayley tree of order two we give explicit formulae and some
numerical values.
