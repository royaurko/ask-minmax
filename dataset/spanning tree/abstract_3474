We study supersymmetric Sp(N) gauge theories with an antisymmetric tensor and
degree n+1 tree level superpotential. The generalized Konishi anomaly equations
derived in hep-th/0304119 and hep-th/0304138 are used to compute the low energy
superpotential of the theory. This is done by imposing a certain integrality
condition on the periods of a meromorphic one form. Explicit computations for
Sp(2), Sp(4), Sp(6) and Sp(8) with cubic superpotential are done and full
agreement with the results of the dynamically generated superpotential approach
is found. As a byproduct, we find a very precise map from Sp(N) to a U(N+2n)
theory with one adjoint and a degree n+1 tree level superpotential.
