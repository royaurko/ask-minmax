The nonlinear cross-polarization interaction among two intense
counterpropagating beams in a span of lossless randomly birefringent telecom
optical fiber may lead to the attraction an initially polarization scrambled
signal towards wave with a well-defined state of polarization at the fiber
output. By exploiting exact analytical solutions of the nonlinear polarization
coupling process we carry out a linear stability study which reveals that
temporally stable stationary solutions are only obtained whenever the output
signal polarization is nearly orthogonal to the input pump polarization.
Moreover, we predict that polarization attraction is acting in full strength
whenever equally intense signal and pump waves are used.
