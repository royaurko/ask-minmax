This paper extends to finite cell complexes the classical enumerative
combinatorics of graphs and their forests in generalized Kirchoff type
theorems. Four types of combinatorial formulae are obtained involving
summations over the resepctive notions introduced here for cell complexes which
are forests, coforests, and two dual notions. Special cases of these formulae
include counting spanning trees in cell complexes, for which some of the
formulae are due to M. Catanzaro, V. Chernyak, and J. Klein. Combining together
a relation of theirs to Reidemeister-Franz torsion with a second relation to
this torsion introduced here yields a generalization to cell complexes of
Trent's classical theorem on mesh matrices for graphs.
