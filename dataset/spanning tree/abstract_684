We propose the use of hierarchical taxonomy to analyze the legislative
election results as a model of multi-party system to show the robustness in
political system. As an example we use the result of Indonesian legislative
election 2004 is analyzed with certain comparative with the previous one
(1999). We construct the graph theoretical analysis by finding the Euclidean
distances among political parties. The distances are then treated in
ultrametric spaces by using the minimum spanning tree algorithm. By having the
Indonesian hierarchical taxonomy model of political parties we show some
patterns emerging the pattern agrees with the classical anthropological
analysis of socio-political system in Indonesia. This fact accentuates a
character of robustness in Indonesian political society as a self-organized
system evolves to critical state. Some small perturbations i.e.: different
voting process resulting the same pattern and occasions statistically, emerges
from the social structure based upon political streams: Islamic, secular,
traditional, and some complements of all.
