We prove an explicit formula of hitting times in terms of enumerations of
spanning trees for random walks on general connected graphs. We apply the
formula to improve Lawler's bound of hitting times for general graphs, prove a
sharp bound of hitting times for adjacent vertices and derive closed formulas
of hitting times for some special graphs.
