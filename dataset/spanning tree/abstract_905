We study the maximum possible sign rank of $N \times N$ sign matrices with a
given VC dimension $d$. For $d=1$, this maximum is $3$. For $d=2$, this maximum
is $\tilde{\Theta}(N^{1/2})$. For $d >2$, similar but slightly less accurate
statements hold.
  The lower bounds are obtained by probabilistic constructions, using a theorem
of Warren in real algebraic topology. The upper bounds are obtained using a
result of Welzl about spanning trees with low stabbing number, and using the
moment curve. The upper bound technique also yields an efficient algorithm that
provides an $O(N/\log(N))$ multiplicative approximation for the sign rank
(Bhangale and Kopparty proved that deciding if the sign rank is at most $3$ is
NP-hard).
  We also observe a general connection between sign rank and spectral gaps
which is based on Forster's argument. Consider the $N \times N$ adjacency
matrix of a $\Delta$ regular graph with a second eigenvalue of absolute value
$\lambda$ and $\Delta \leq N/2$. We show that the sign rank of the signed
version of this matrixis at least $\Delta/\lambda$. We also describe
limitations of this approach, in the spirit of the Alon-Boppana theorem.
  We further describe connections to communication complexity, geometry,
learning theory, and combinatorics.
