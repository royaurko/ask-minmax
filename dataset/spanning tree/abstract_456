We generalize the notions of flippable and simultaneously flippable edges in
a triangulation of a set S of points in the plane to so-called
\emph{pseudo-simultaneously flippable edges}. Such edges are related to the
notion of convex decompositions spanned by S.
  We prove a worst-case tight lower bound for the number of
pseudo-simultaneously flippable edges in a triangulation in terms of the number
of vertices. We use this bound for deriving new upper bounds for the maximal
number of crossing-free straight-edge graphs that can be embedded on any fixed
set of N points in the plane. We obtain new upper bounds for the number of
spanning trees and forests as well.
  Specifically, let tr(N) denote the maximum number of triangulations on a set
of N points in the plane. Then we show (using the known bound tr(N) < 30^N)
that any N-element point set admits at most 6.9283^N * tr(N) < 207.85^N
crossing-free straight-edge graphs, O(4.7022^N) * tr(N) = O(141.07^N) spanning
trees, and O(5.3514^N) * tr(N) = O(160.55^N) forests. We also obtain upper
bounds for the number of crossing-free straight-edge graphs that have cN, fewer
than cN, or more than cN edges, for any constant parameter c, in terms of c and
N.
