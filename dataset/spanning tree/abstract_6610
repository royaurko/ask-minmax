We present the first version of a new tool to scan the parameter space of
generic scalar potentials, ScannerS. The main goal of ScannerS is to help
distinguish between different patterns of symmetry breaking for each scalar
potential. In this work we use it to investigate the possibility of excluding
regions of the phase diagram of several versions of a complex singlet extension
of the Standard Model, with future LHC results. We find that if another scalar
is found, one can exclude a phase with a dark matter candidate in definite
regions of the parameter space, while predicting whether a third scalar to be
found must be lighter or heavier. The first version of the code is publicly
available and contains various generic core routines for tree level vacuum
stability analysis, as well as implementations of collider bounds, dark matter
constraints, electroweak precision constraints and tree level unitarity.
