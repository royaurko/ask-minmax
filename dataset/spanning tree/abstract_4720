In this paper, we consider the finite time blow up for the following two kind
of wave equations on de Sitter spacetime \begin{eqnarray*} &&\square_g=F(u),\\
&&\square_g=F(\partial_tu,\nabla u). \end{eqnarray*} The first problem is
related to the latter problem of conjecture of Strauss on de Sitter Spacetime,
and the second problem corresponds to the latter problem of conjecture of
Glassey on de Sitter Spacetime. This proof is based on a new blow up criterion.
Meanwhile, we give a generalized blow up criterion, which not only generalize
the blow up criterion in Sideris \cite{Sider}, but also derive some new blow up
criterions from the generalized blow up criterion. Furthermore, the estimate of
the life span is obtained.
