Dynamic programming on tree decompositions is a frequently used approach to
solve otherwise intractable problems on instances of small treewidth. In recent
work by Bodlaender et al., it was shown that for many connectivity problems,
there exist algorithms that use time, linear in the number of vertices, and
single exponential in the width of the tree decomposition that is used. The
central idea is that it suffices to compute representative sets, and these can
be computed efficiently with help of Gaussian elimination.
  In this paper, we give an experimental evaluation of this technique for the
Steiner Tree problem. A comparison of the classic dynamic programming algorithm
and the improved dynamic programming algorithm that employs the table reduction
shows that the new approach gives significant improvements on the running time
of the algorithm and the size of the tables computed by the dynamic programming
algorithm, and thus that the rank based approach from Bodlaender et al. does
not only give significant theoretical improvements but also is a viable
approach in a practical setting, and showcases the potential of exploiting the
idea of representative sets for speeding up dynamic programming algorithms.
