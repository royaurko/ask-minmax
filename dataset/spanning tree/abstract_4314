At SODA 2009, Demaine et al. presented a novel connection between binary
search trees (BSTs) and subsets of points on the plane. This connection was
independently discovered by Derryberry et al. As part of their results, Demaine
et al. considered GreedyFuture, an offline BST algorithm that greedily
rearranges the search path to minimize the cost of future searches. They showed
that GreedyFuture is actually an online algorithm in their geometric view, and
that there is a way to turn GreedyFuture into an online BST algorithm with only
a constant factor increase in total search cost. Demaine et al. conjectured
this algorithm was dynamically optimal, but no upper bounds were given in their
paper. We prove the first non-trivial upper bounds for the cost of search
operations using GreedyFuture including giving an access lemma similar to that
found in Sleator and Tarjan's classic paper on splay trees.
