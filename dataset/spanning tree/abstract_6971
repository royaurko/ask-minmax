Multiplicative cascades, under weak or strong disorder, refer to sequences of
positive random measures $\mu_{n,\beta}, n = 1,2,\dots$, parameterized by a
positive disorder parameter $\beta$, and defined on the Borel $\sigma$-field
${\mathcal B}$ of $\partial T = \{0,1,\dots b-1\}^\infty$ for the product
topology. The normalized cascade is defined by the corresponding sequence of
random probability measures $prob_{n,\beta}:= Z_{n,\beta}^{-1}\mu_{n,\beta}, n
= 1,2\dots,$ normalized to a probability by the partition function
$Z_{n,\beta}$. In this note, a recent result of Madaule (2011) is used to
explicitly construct a family of tree indexed probability measures
$prob_{\infty,\beta}$ for strong disorder parameters $\beta > \beta_c$, almost
surely defined on a common probability space. Moreover, viewing
$\{prob_{n,\beta}: \beta > \beta_c\}_{n=1}^\infty$ as a sequence of probability
measure valued stochastic process leads to finite dimensional weak convergence
in distribution to a probability measure valued process $\{prob_{\infty,\beta}:
\beta > \beta_c\}$. The limit process is constructed from the tree-indexed
random field of derivative martingales, and the Brunet-Derrida-Madaule
decorated Poisson process. A number of corollaries are provided to illustrate
the utility of this construction.
