We extend the description of gravitational waves emitted by binary black
holes during the final stages of inspiral and merger by introducing in the
third post-Newtonian (3PN) effective-one-body (EOB) templates seven new
``flexibility'' parameters that affect the two-body dynamics and gravitational
radiation emission. The plausible ranges of these flexibility parameters,
notably the parameter characterising the fourth post-Newtonian effects in the
dynamics, are estimated. Using these estimates, we show that the currently
available standard 3PN bank of EOB templates does ``span'' the space of signals
opened up by all the flexibility parameters, in that their maximized mutual
overlaps are larger than 96.5%. This confirms the effectualness of 3PN EOB
templates for the detection of binary black holes in gravitational-wave data
from interferometric detectors. The possibility to drastically reduce the
number of EOB templates using a few ``universal'' phasing functions is
suggested.
