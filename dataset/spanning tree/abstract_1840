Given a set of leaf-labeled trees with identical leaf sets, the well-known
"Maximum Agreement SubTree" problem (MAST) consists of finding a subtree
homeomorphically included in all input trees and with the largest number of
leaves. Its variant called "Maximum Compatible Tree" (MCT) is less stringent,
as it allows the input trees to be refined. Both problems are of particular
interest in computational biology, where trees encountered have often small
degrees.
  In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of MAST and MCT with
respect to the maximum degree, denoted by D, of the input trees. It is known
that MAST is polynomial for bounded D. As a counterpart, we show that the
problem is W[1]-hard with respect to parameter D. Moreover, relying on recent
advances in parameterized complexity we obtain a tight lower bound: while MAST
can be solved in O(N^{O(D)}) time where N denotes the input length, we show
that an O(N^{o(D)}) bound is not achievable, unless SNP is contained in SE. We
also show that MCT is W[1]-hard with respect to D, and that MCT cannot be
solved in O(N^{o(2^{D/2})}) time, SNP is contained in SE.
