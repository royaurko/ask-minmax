We give combinatorial criteria for predicting the transcendental weight of
Feynman integrals of certain graphs in $\phi^4$ theory. By studying spanning
forest polynomials, we obtain operations on graphs which are weight-preserving,
and a list of subgraphs which induce a drop in the transcendental weight.
