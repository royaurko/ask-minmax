The Laplace operator is considered for waveguides perturbed by a periodic
structure consisting of N congruent obstacles spanning the waveguide. Neumann
boundary conditions are imposed on the periodic structure, and either Neumann
or Dirichlet conditions on the guide walls. It is proven that there are at
least N (resp. N-1) trapped modes in the Neumann case (resp. Dirichlet case)
under fairly general hypotheses, including the special case where the obstacles
consist of line segments placed parallel to the waveguide walls. This work
should be viewed as an extension of "Periodic structures on waveguides" by
Linton and McIvor.
