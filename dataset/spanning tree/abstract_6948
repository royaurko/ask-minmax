According to the IEC 61508 functional safety standard, it is required to
estimate the achieved safety integrity of the system due to random hardware
failures. For a safety function operating in a low demand mode, this measure is
the average probability of a dangerous failure on demand (PFDavg). In the
present paper, four techniques have been applied to various configurations of a
case study: fault tree analyses supported by GRIF/Tree, multi-phase Markov
models supported by GRIF/Markov, stochastic Petri nets with predicates
supported by GRIF/Petri, and approximate equations (developed by DNV and
different from those given in IEC 61508) supported by OrbitSIL. It is shown
that all these methods yield very similar results for PFDavg, taking the
characteristics required by the standard into account. The choice of a method
should therefore not be determined by dogmatic assumptions, but should result
of a balance between modelling effort and objectives, given the system
properties. For this task, a discussion about pros and cons of each method is
proposed.
