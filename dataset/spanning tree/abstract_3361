We consider the motion of a compressible, viscous, and heat conducting fluid
in the regime of small viscosity and heat conductivity. It is shown that weak
solutions of the associated Navier- Stokes-Fourier system converge to a
(strong) solution of the Euler system on its life span. The problem is studied
in a bounded domain in the three dimensional Euclidean space, on the boundary
of which the velocity field satisfies the complete slip boundary conditions.
