A natural way to deal with multiple, partially conflicting objectives is
turning all the objectives but one into budget constraints. Some classical
polynomial-time optimization problems, such as spanning tree and forest,
shortest path, (perfect) matching, independent set (basis) in a matroid or in
the intersection of two matroids, become NP-hard even with one budget
constraint. Still, for most of these problems deterministic and randomized
polynomial-time approximation schemes are known. In the case of two or more
budgets, typically only multi-criteria approximation schemes are available,
which return slightly infeasible solutions. Not much is known however for the
case of strict budget constraints: filling this gap is the main goal of this
paper.
  We show that shortest path, perfect matching, and spanning tree (and hence
matroid basis and matroid intersection basis) are inapproximable already with
two budget constraints. For the remaining problems, whose set of solutions
forms an independence system, we present deterministic and randomized
polynomial-time approximation schemes for a constant number k of budget
constraints. Our results are based on a variety of techniques:
  1. We present a simple and powerful mechanism to transform multi-criteria
approximation schemes into pure approximation schemes.
  2. We show that points in low dimensional faces of any matroid polytope are
almost integral, an interesting result on its own. This gives a deterministic
approximation scheme for k-budgeted matroid independent set.
  3. We present a deterministic approximation scheme for 2-budgeted matching.
The backbone of this result is a purely topological property of curves in R^2.
