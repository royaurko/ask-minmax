We study the hadroproduction of two neutral Higgs bosons in the minimal
supersymmetric extension of the standard model, which provides a handle on the
trilinear Higgs couplings. We include the contributions from quark-antiquark
annihilation at the tree level and those from gluon-gluon fusion, which
proceeds via quark and squark loops. We list compact results for the tree-level
partonic cross sections and the squark loop amplitudes, and we confirm previous
results for the quark loop amplitudes. We quantitatively analyze the hadronic
cross sections at the CERN Large Hadron Collider assuming a favorable
supergravity-inspired scenario.
