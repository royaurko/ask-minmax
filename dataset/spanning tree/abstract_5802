The 88 constellations as defined by the IAU segment the sky into regions,
separated by an intricate set of boundaries. A binary tree decomposition of
this landscape is given which tessellates the celestial sphere into rectangles.
This allows a fast determination of the constellation membership of any given
sky coordinate.
