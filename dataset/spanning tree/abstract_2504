We derive compact analytical formulae for all tree-level color-ordered gauge
theory amplitudes involving any number of external gluons and up to three
massless quark-anti-quark pairs. A general formula is presented based on the
combinatorics of paths along a rooted tree and associated determinants.
Explicit expressions are displayed for the next-to-maximally helicity violating
(NMHV) and next-to-next-to-maximally helicity violating (NNMHV) gauge theory
amplitudes. Our results are obtained by projecting the previously-found
expressions for the super-amplitudes of the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory (N=4 SYM) onto the relevant components yielding all gluon-gluino tree
amplitudes in N=4 SYM. We show how these results carry over to the
corresponding QCD amplitudes, including massless quarks of different flavors as
well as a single electroweak vector boson. The public Mathematica package GGT
is described, which encodes the results of this work and yields analytical
formulae for all N=4 SYM gluon-gluino trees. These in turn yield all QCD trees
with up to four external arbitrary-flavored massless quark-anti-quark-pairs.
