The application of optimization techniques derived from the study of
Euclidean full Steiner Trees to macromolecules like proteins is reported in the
present work. We shall use the concept of Euclidean Steiner Ratio Function
(SRF) as a good Lyapunov function in order to perform an elementary stability
analysis.
