We characterize the compatibility of a collection of unrooted phylogenetic
trees as a question of determining whether a graph derived from these trees ---
the display graph --- has a specific kind of triangulation, which we call
legal. Our result is a counterpart to the well known triangulation-based
characterization of the compatibility of undirected multi-state characters.
