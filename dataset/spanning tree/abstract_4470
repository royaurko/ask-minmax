In streamed graph drawing, a planar graph, G, is given incrementally as a
data stream and a straight-line drawing of G must be updated after each new
edge is released. To preserve the mental map, changes to the drawing should be
minimized after each update, and Binucci et al.show that exponential area is
necessary and sufficient for a number of streamed graph drawings for trees if
edges are not allowed to move at all. We show that a number of streamed graph
drawings can, in fact, be done with polynomial area, including planar streamed
graph drawings of trees, tree-maps, and outerplanar graphs, if we allow for a
small number of coordinate movements after each update. Our algorithms involve
an interesting connection to a classic algorithmic problem - the file
maintenance problem - and we also give new algorithms for this problem in a
framework where bulk memory moves are allowed.
