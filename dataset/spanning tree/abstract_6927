A random binary search tree grown from the uniformly random permutation of
$[n]$ is studied. We analyze the exact and asymptotic counts of vertices by
rank, the distance from the set of leaves. The asymptotic fraction $c_k$ of
vertices of a fixed rank $k\ge 0$ is shown to decay exponentially with $k$.
Notoriously hard to compute, the exact fractions $c_k$ had been determined for
$k\le 3$ only. We computed $c_4$ and $c_5$ as well; both are ratios of enormous
integers, denominator of $c_5$ being $274$ digits long. Prompted by the data,
we proved that, in sharp contrast, the largest prime divisor of $c_k$'s
denominator is $2^{k+1}+1$ at most. We conjecture that, in fact, the prime
divisors of every denominator for $k>1$ form a single interval, from $2$ to the
largest prime not exceeding $2^{k+1}+1$.
