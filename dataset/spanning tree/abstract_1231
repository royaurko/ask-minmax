Reduction trees are a way of encoding a substitution procedure dictated by
the relations of an algebra. We use reduction trees in the subdivision algebra
to construct canonical triangulations of flow polytopes which are shellable. We
explain how a shelling of the canonical triangulation can be read off from the
corresponding reduction tree in the subdivision algebra. We then introduce the
notion of shellable reduction trees in the subdivision and related algebras and
define h-polynomials of reduction trees. In the case of the subdivision
algebra, the h-polynomials of the canonical triangulations of flow polytopes
equal the h-polynomials of the corresponding reduction trees, which motivated
our definition. We show that the reduced forms in various algebras, which can
be read off from the leaves of the reduction trees, specialize to the shifted
h-polynomials of the corresponding reduction trees. This yields a technique for
proving nonnegativity properties of reduced forms. As a corollary we settle a
conjecture of A.N. Kirillov.
