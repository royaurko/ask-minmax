Correlation matrices of foreign exchange rate time series are investigated
for 60 world currencies. Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) graphs for the gold,
silver and platinum are presented. Inverse power like scaling is discussed for
these graphs as well as for four distinct currency groups (major, liquid, less
liquid and non-tradable). The worst scaling has been found for USD and related
currencies.
