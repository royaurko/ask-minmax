This paper is devoted to the stabilization problem for nonlinear driftless
control systems by means of a time-varying feedback control. It is assumed that
the vector fields of the system together with their first order Lie brackets
span the whole tangent space at the equilibrium. A family of trigonometric
open-loop controls is constructed to approximate the gradient flow associated
with a Lyapunov function. These controls are applied for the derivation of a
time-varying feedback law under the sampling strategy. By using Lyapunov's
direct method, we prove that the controller proposed ensures exponential
stability of the equilibrium. As an example, this control design procedure is
applied to stabilize the Brockett integrator.
