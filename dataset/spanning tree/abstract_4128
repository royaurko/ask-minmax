GRACE/SUSY is a program package for generating the tree-level amplitude and
evaluating the corresponding cross section of processes of the minimal
supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM). The Higgs potential
adopted in the system, however, is assumed to have a more general form
indicated by the two-Higgs-doublet model. This system is an extension of GRACE
for the standard model(SM) of the electroweak and strong interactions. For a
given MSSM process the Feynman graphs and amplitudes at tree-level are
automatically created. The Monte-Carlo phase space integration by means of
BASES gives the total and differential cross sections. When combined with
SPRING, an event generator, the program package provides us with the simulation
of the SUSY particle productions.
