We calculate the almost sure dimension for a general class of random affine
code tree fractals in $\mathbb R^d$. The result is based on a probabilistic
version of the Falconer-Sloan condition $C(s)$ introduced in \cite{FS}. We
verify that, in general, systems having a small number of maps do not satisfy
condition $C(s)$. However, there exists a natural number $n$ such that for
typical systems the family of all iterates up to level $n$ satisfies condition
$C(s)$.
