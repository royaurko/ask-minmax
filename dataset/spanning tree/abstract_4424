Let $T_n^1=(V,E_1)$ and $T_n^2=(V,E_2)$ be the trees on $n$ vertices with
$V=\{v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_{n-1}\}$,
$E_1=\{v_0v_1,\ldots,v_0v_{n-3},v_{n-4}v_{n-2},v_{n-3}v_{n-1}\}$, and
$E_2=\{v_0v_1,\ldots,$ $v_0v_{n-3},v_{n-3}v_{n-2}, v_{n-3}v_{n-1}\}$. In this
paper, for $p\ge n\ge 5$ we obtain explicit formulas for $\ex(p;T_n^1)$ and
$\ex(p;T_n^2)$, where $\ex(p;L)$ denotes the maximal number of edges in a graph
of order $p$ not containing $L$ as a subgraph. Let $r(G\sb 1, G\sb 2)$ be the
Ramsey number of the two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$. In this paper we also obtain
some explicit formulas for $r(T_m,T_n^i)$, where $i\in\{1,2\}$ and $T_m$ is a
tree on $m$ vertices with $\Delta(T_m)\le m-3$.
