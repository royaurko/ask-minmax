We describe here a proposal for a light injection calibration system for the
MINOS detectors based on ultra bright blue LEDs as the light source. We have
shown that these LEDs are bright enough to span over two orders of magnitude in
light intensity, commensurate with that expected in a single scintillator strip
in the MINOS neutrino detectors.
