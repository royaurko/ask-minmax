We consider here the problem of chaining seeds in ordered trees. Seeds are
mappings between two trees Q and T and a chain is a subset of non overlapping
seeds that is consistent with respect to postfix order and ancestrality. This
problem is a natural extension of a similar problem for sequences, and has
applications in computational biology, such as mining a database of RNA
secondary structures. For the chaining problem with a set of m constant size
seeds, we describe an algorithm with complexity O(m2 log(m)) in time and O(m2)
in space.
