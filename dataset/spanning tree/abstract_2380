A simple combinatorial argument employing symmetry of edges is put forth to
establish a recursive relation for counting the number of different labeled
trees $T_n$ on $n$ vertices.
  $T_n = \frac{n}{2} \sum_{k=0}^{n-2} {n-2 \choose k} T_{k+1} T_{n-k-1};$ for n
> 1 and $T_1 = 1$
  It is proved that $T_n$ calculated from this recursive relation is equivalent
to the well known Cayley's Tree Formula $n^{n-2}$.
