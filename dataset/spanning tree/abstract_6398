In a previous work we introduced an elementary method to analyze the
periodicity of a generating function defined by a single equation y=G(x,y).
This was based on deriving a single set-equation Y = Gammma(Y) defining the
spectrum of the generating function. This paper focuses on extending the
analysis of periodicity to generating functions defined by a system of
equations y = G(x,y).
  The final section looks at periodicity results for the spectra of monadic
second-order classes whose spectrum is determined by an equational
specification - an observation of Compton shows that monadic-second order
classes of trees have this property. This section concludes with a substantial
simplification of the proofs in the 2003 foundational paper on spectra by
Gurevich and Shelah, namely new proofs are given of:
  (1) every monadic second-order class of $m$-colored functional digraphs is
eventually periodic, and
  (2) the monadic second-order theory of finite trees is decidable.
