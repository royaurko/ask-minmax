A useful inequality is obtained if charmless strange B decays are assumed to
be dominated by the gluonic penguin diagram and the tree diagram contribution
is small but not negligible. The penguin-tree interference contribution which
is linear in the tree amplitude is included but the direct tree contribution
which is quadratic is neglected.
