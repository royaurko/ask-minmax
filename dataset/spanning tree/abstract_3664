An electroweak (EW) model has been investigated (Moffat) in which the energy
$E < \mu=\sqrt{\lambda}M_W$, where $\lambda$ is a gauge parameter and $M_W$ is
the $W$ boson mass. For large enough $\lambda$ the scalar boson mass
$\mu=\sqrt{\lambda}M_W$ can be heavy enough to avoid detection in LHC
experiments. The theory is perturbatively renormalizable for the decoupled
scalar interactions. The Born approximation tree graph unitarity can be ensured
by postulating that the effective coupling constant $g_{\rm eff}(s)$ vanishes
as $1/\sqrt{s}$ or faster as $s\rightarrow\infty$, predicting that the EW
interactions become weaker at high energies, and longitudinally polarized $W_L
W_L\rightarrow W_L W_L$ scattering does not violate Born approximation tree
graph unitarity.
