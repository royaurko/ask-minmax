An evolutionary tree is a rooted tree where each internal vertex has at least
two children and where the leaves are labeled with distinct symbols
representing species. Evolutionary trees are useful for modeling the
evolutionary history of species. An agreement subtree of two evolutionary trees
is an evolutionary tree which is also a topological subtree of the two given
trees. We give an algorithm to determine the largest possible number of leaves
in any agreement subtree of two trees T_1 and T_2 with n leaves each. If the
maximum degree d of these trees is bounded by a constant, the time complexity
is O(n log^2(n)) and is within a log(n) factor of optimal. For general d, this
algorithm runs in O(n d^2 log(d) log^2(n)) time or alternatively in O(n d
sqrt(d) log^3(n)) time.
