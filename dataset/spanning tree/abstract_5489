We consider frames in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space Hn where frames are
exactly the spanning sets of the vector space. We present a method to determine
the maximum robustness of a frame. We present results on tight subframes and
surgery of frames. We also answer the question of when length surgery resulting
in a tight frame set for Hn is possible.
