We show that the nearest neighbors Ising model on the Cayley tree exhibits
new temperature driven phase transitions. These transitions holds at various
inverse temperatures different from the critical one. They are depicted by a
change in the number of Gibbs states as well as by a drastic change of the
behavior of free energies at these new transition points.
