We describe families of complete orthogonal bases of full rank matrices which
span the vector spaces of square matrices. The proposed bases generalise
non-trivially the Pauli matrice while shedding light on their algebraic
properties. Finally we introduce the notion k -pseudo-closure for orthogonal
bases spanning vector subspaces of square matrices and discuss their
connections with hadamard matrices.
