A permutation $p$ gives rise to a graph $G_p$; the vertices of $G_p$ are the
letters in the permutation and the edges of $G_p$ are the inversions of $p$. In
this study, a permutation tree refers to a tree that belongs to the class of
permutation graphs. We find the number of permutation trees of given size and
study three graph invariants on a permutation tree chosen uniformly at random:
the highest degree, the diameter, and the number of degree-one vertices.
Denoting the random tree of size $n$ by $T_n$, the highest degree in this tree
by $H_n$, and the diameter of $T_n$ by $D_n$, we show that $H_n/\log_{2}n$
approaches 1 in probability as $n$ tends to infinity and $(D_n-2)$ is
binomially distributed with parameters $(n-3)$ and $0.5$. We also find the
distribution of the number of degree-one vertices in $T_n$.
