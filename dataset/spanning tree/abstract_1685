We provide a bijection between the set of factorizations, that is,
ordered (n-1)-tuples of transpositions in ${\mathcal S}_{n}$ whose product is
(12...n), and labelled trees on $n$ vertices. We prove a refinement of a
theorem of D\'{e}nes that establishes new tree-like properties of
factorizations. In particular, we show that a certain class of transpositions
of a factorization correspond naturally under our bijection to leaf edges of a
tree. Moreover, we give a generalization of this fact.
