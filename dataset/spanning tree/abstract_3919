This paper investigates one of the most fundamental computer vision problems:
image segmentation. We propose a supervised hierarchical approach to
object-independent full image segmentation. Starting with over-segmenting
superpixels, our approach uses a tree-like constrained conditional model to
incorporate the region merging hierarchy with their likelihoods, which are
predicted using an ensemble boundary classifier. Final segmentations can be
inferred by finding the globally optimal solution to the model efficiently. We
also present an iterative method for increasing the diversity of region merging
hierarchies and emphasizing accurate boundaries by segmentation accumulation.
Extensive experimental validation and comparison with other recent methods
demonstrate that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art segmentation
performance and is very competitive in image segmentation without semantic
priors.
