In this paper, we present a fully-dynamic distributed algorithm for
maintaining a minimum spanning tree on general graphs with positive real edge
weights. The goal of a dynamic MST algorithm is to update efficiently the
minimum spanning tree after dynamic changes like edge weight changes, rather
than having to recompute it from scatch each time. The first part of the paper
surveys various algorithms available today both in sequential and distributed
environments to solve static MST problem. We also present some of the efficient
sequential algorithms for computing dynamic MST like the Frederickson's
algorithm and Eppstein's sparsification technique. Lastly we present our new
sequential and distributed algorithms for dynamic MST problem. To our
knowledge, this is the first of the distributed algorithms for computing
dynamic MSTs.
