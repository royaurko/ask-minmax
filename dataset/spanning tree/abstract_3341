A revised phase diagram for water shows three distinct fluid phases. There is
no continuity of liquid and gas and no critical point on Gibbs density surface.
A liquid state, water, spans all temperatures. A thermodynamic rigidity
function, which distinguishes gas and 'liquid, shows a remarkable symmetry
between complimentary corresponding states of steam and water.
