The problem of counting plane trees with $n$ edges and an even or an odd
number of leaves was studied by Eu, Liu and Yeh, in connection with an identity
on coloring nets due to Stanley. This identity was also obtained by Bonin,
Shapiro and Simion in their study of Schr\"oder paths, and it was recently
derived by Coker using the Lagrange inversion formula. An equivalent problem
for partitions was independently studied by Klazar. We present three parity
reversing involutions, one for unlabelled plane trees, the other for labelled
plane trees and one for 2-Motzkin paths which are in one-to-one correspondence
with Dyck paths.
