We show that an infinite Galton-Watson tree, conditioned on its martingale
limit being smaller than $\eps$, converges as $\eps\downarrow 0$ in law to the
regular $\mu$-ary tree, where $\mu$ is the essential minimum of the offspring
distribution. This gives an example of entropic repulsion where the limit has
no entropy.
