Password: This paper presents a genetic algorithm for solving capacitated vehicle routing problem, which is mainly characterised by using vehicles of the same capacity based at a central depot that will be optimally routed to supply customers with known demands. The proposed algorithm uses an optimised crossover operator designed by a complete undirected bipartite graph to find an optimal set of delivery routes satisfying the requirements and giving minimal total cost. We tested our algorithm with benchmark instances and compared it with some other heuristics in the literature. Computational results showed that the proposed algorithm is competitive in terms of the quality of the solutions found.

Introduction equation ( 1.1 ) Cost = ∑ i = 1 m Cost ( R i ) = ∑ j = 0 k c j , j + 1 + ∑ j = 0 n t j . The CVRP consists in determining a set of a maximum of m routes of minimum total cost, such that each route starts and ends at the depot, each customer is visited exactly once by exactly one vehicle, subject to the restriction that the total demand of any route does not exceed Q . We additionally consider that the total duration of any route is not longer than a preset bound D . A survey on the CVRP and variants is given by Toth and Vigo [1] and an overview of heuristics and metaheuristics may also be found in Laporte et al. [2] and Cordeau et al. [3]  and  [4] . The tabu search implementations of Taillard [5] and Rochat and Taillard [6] have obtained the best known results to benchmark VRPs. Osman [7] , Gendreau et al. [8] , Rego and Roucairol [9] , Barbarosoglu and Ozgur [10] , and Toth and Vigo [11] have reported similar results obtained using tabu search. Osamn [7] and Hiquebran et al. [12] also achieved similar results by applying simulated annealing to the problem. However, Renaud et al. [13] observed that such heuristics required substantial computing times and several parameter settings. Bullnheimer et al. [14] and Gambardella et al. [15] proposed ant colony for VRPs. Their approaches have given results which are only slightly inferior to those from tabu search. Mester and Bräysy [16] presented an adaptation of the active guided evolution strategies metaheuristic for the CVRP. The results demonstrated that their suggested method is highly competitive. Tarantilis [17] developed an adaptive memory programming method for solving the CVPR. Moreover, Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), which is a population based search method that mimics the behavior of group organism as a searching method, is proposed for solving the CVRP by Chen et al. [18] and Ai and Kachitvichyanukul [19]  and  [20] . Genetic algorithms (GAs) have also been applied for the VRPs. Potvin et al. [21] applied a hybrid approach to vehicle routing using neural networks and GA. Two hybrid GAs for the CVRP and distance VRP are proposed by Berger and Barkaoui [22] and Prins [23] respectively. Baker and Ayechew [24] considered the application of a GA to the basic VRP, which is competitive with other modern heuristics in terms of computing time and solution quality. Alba and Dorronsoro [25] proposed the utilization of some cellular GAs with and without including local search techniques for solving the CVRP. Also, Alba and Dorronsoro [26] focused in providing new optimal values for three additional benchmarks of Van Breedam [27] , Golden et al. [28] , and Taillard [5] . Their Computational results gave a high performance in terms of the quality of the solutions found and the number of function evaluations. In this study, we propose an optimised crossover genetic algorithm (OCGA) for the CVRP. Section 2 gives a detailed descriptions of the proposed algorithm. In Section 3 , the computational results are presented and discussed. In the final section, we give a brief conclusion. 2. Optimised crossover genetic algorithm (OCGA) GAs were first proposed by John Holland [29] in the 1960s. The idea behind a GA is to model the natural evolution by using genetic inheritance together with Darwin’s theory. A population of individuals representing tentative solutions is maintained over many generations. New individuals are produced by combining members of the population via crossover and mutation operators, and these replace existing individuals with some policies. Most of the current methods of crossover determine a child by using a stochastic approach and without reference to the objective function. Optimised crossover was proposed by Aggarwal et al. [30] for the independent set problem. They applied optimised crossover within GA, which takes into account the objective function in a straightforward way, and produced two new children: the O-child (Optimum child) and E-child (Exploratory child). The O-child is constructed in such a way that has the best objective function value from a feasible set of children, while the E-child is constructed so as to maintain the diversity of the search space. Balas and Niehaus [31] developed this approach to produce a superior GA.
