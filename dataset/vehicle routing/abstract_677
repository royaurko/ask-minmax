  This work summarizes trends and published research during the last decade in ship scheduling and related problems, and identifies issues which require further investigation. The rapid development of computing power has facilitated optimal solutions to ship scheduling problems which may result in significant economic impact. However, the scarcity of published work in this area indicates the low level of penetration of quantitative models into industrial applications.
