Volume 43 of the series Operations Research/Computer Science Interfaces pp 199-218 Recent Developments in Dynamic Vehicle Routing Systems Allan Larsen Affiliated with Centre for Traffic and Transport, The Technical University of Denmark   Email author   , Oli B.G. Madsen Affiliated with Centre for Traffic and Transport, The Technical University of Denmark , Marius M. Solomon Affiliated with College of Business Administration Department of Information, Operations and Analysis, Northeastern University This chapter examines the evolution of research on dynamic vehicle routing problems (DVRP). We de?ne the DVRP and show how it is di?erent from the traditional static vehicle routing problem. We then illustrate the technological environment required. Next, we discuss important characteristics of the problem, including the degree of dynamism, elements relevant for the system objective, and evaluation methods for the performance of algorithms.The chapter then summarizes research prior to 2000 and focuses on developments from 2000 to present. Finally, we o?er our conclusions and suggest directions for future research. Key words Networks transportation dynamic vehicle routing problems
