Vehicle routing optimization software has been implemented on a personal computer for Quality Stores, a chain of retail stores. Customized route generation procedures are combined with an efficient branch-and-bound procedure to obtain optimal routings and assignment of routes to trucks. Both the data base maintenance routines and optimization runs are completely menu-driven, enabling personnel with no prior exposure to computers or optimization to operate the software unaided.
