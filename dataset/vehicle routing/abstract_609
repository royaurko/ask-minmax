Hybrid particle swarm optimization for vehicle routing problem with multiple objectives XU Jie,HUANG De-xian(Dep.of Automation,Tsinghua Univ.,Beijing 100084,China)   In order to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows(VRPTW) with multiple objectives,a solution was proposed by combining Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) with mutation operator.In the solution,with the help of roulette-wheel selection and mutation operator,the discrete problem with multiple objectives could be converged to optimal Pareto set and equally distributed along Pareto curve.The random key was adopted to change from continuous particle position vectors to discrete solution vectors.And the method of relatively minimum distance was proposed to evaluate the Pareto muster.In addition,no-interval coding method was put forward to reduce invalid iteration.Result of the experiments showed that the algorithm was simple and effective.
