The cumulative capacitated vehicle routing problem (CCVRP) is a variation of the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem in which the objective is the minimization of the sum of arrival times at customers, instead of the total routing cost. This paper presents an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the CCVRP. This algorithm is applied to a set of benchmark instances and compared with two recently published memetic algorithms.

Introduction The purpose of this paper is to describe an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic (ALNS) for the cumulative capacitated vehicle routing problem (CCVRP). This problem is a variation of the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) in which the objective is the minimization of the sum of arrival times at the customers instead of the total routing cost. The CCVRP is an extension of the delivery man problem (DMP) [1]  and  [2] to the case of several vehicles. The DMP has applications in job scheduling problems on a single machine [3]  and  [4] . All applications of the DMP extend naturally to the CCVRP. The CCVRP with time windows can be used to model some school bus routing problems [5]  and  [6] . An important application of the CCVRP arises in the procurement of humanitarian aid in the context of natural disasters, such as tsunamis or earthquakes, where it is crucial to reduce suffering and life losses [7] , [8] , [9]  and  [10] . Campbell et al. [8] show that routes created by optimizing with respect to the CVRP objective can serve communities significantly later than those generated with a CCVRP objective and are not completely fair for a humanitarian supply chain. Besides, optimal solutions for the traditional CVRP can be significantly different from those observed in the context of the delivery of humanitarian aid [8]  and  [9] . Ngueveu et al. [9] have recently studied the CCVRP with a homogeneous fleet and a single depot. These authors have proposed lower bounds and two memetic algorithms (MA) which were applied to some instances with up to 199 vertices. Nolz et al. [10] have presented a bi-objective metaheuristic for a problem in which vehicle routes must be planned to deliver drinking water in a post-disaster situation. More precisely, the authors consider the joint minimization of the sum of distances between population centers and their nearest facility, and of the latest arrival time of the supply vehicle at a population center. They have applied their algorithm to instances with up to 41 vertices, based on data from Manabí, Ecuador. Campbell et al. [8] have considered the traveling salesman problem and the CVRP with two alternative objective functions: one that minimizes the maximal arrival time, and one that minimizes the average (or total) arrival time. They have derived lower bounds, as well as some insertion and local search heuristics. Tests were performed on 50 instances with 30 to 79 customers proposed by Augerat et al. [11] , where customers are distributed uniformly or grouped into clusters, and on 11 instances proposed by Golden et al. [12] , with at most 100 customers, which are based on special structures such as concentric circles, diamonds, squares and stars. The CCVRP is NP-hard [9] and difficult to solve to optimality for even moderate instance sizes. There is, therefore, a need to develop efficient heuristics for this problem. To our knowledge, the only available heuristics for the CCVRP are the MAs of Ngueveu et al. [9] . Our aim is to develop an alternative adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic (ALNS) for the CCVRP and to compare it to the two heuristics of Ngueveu et al. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls the mathematical formulation, the memetic heuristics and the lower bounds proposed by Ngueveu et al. [9] . Our ALNS heuristic is described in Section 3 , followed by computational results in Section 4 . Conclusions are presented in Section 5 . 2. Mathematical model, lower bounds and memetic algorithm This section presents a brief overview of the paper presented by Ngueveu et al. [9] . We first recall their mathematical programming formulation in order to state the CCVRP in a precise fashion. We then describe the lower bounds and the MA proposed by these authors.
