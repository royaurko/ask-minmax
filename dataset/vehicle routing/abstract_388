  We report on a decision support system (DSS) that recommends solutions to a particular version of the vehicle routing problem occurring in the New Zealand dairy industry. FleetManager is a DSS developed for use by New Zealand milk tanker schedulers and is designed to aid them in creating or improving milk tanker routes using their experience and preferences. The DSS uses multiple, resizable, overlapping windows to assist schedulers in their tasks. Users can also interact with the system through a graphical interface which displays a road map of the area and the location of the milk processing plants and milk suppliers. FleetManager also contains the option of automatically creating vehicle routes, which can be modified by the users. The system can be used to analyze a wide variety of “What-if?” scenarios with potential cost impacts.
