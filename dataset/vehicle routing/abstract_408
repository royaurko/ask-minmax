  This paper introduces a parallel iterated tabu search heuristic for solving four different routing problems: the classical vehicle routing problem (VRP), the periodic VRP, the multi-depot VRP, and the site-dependent VRP. In addition, it is applicable to the time-window constrained variant of these problems. Using the iterated local search framework, the heuristic combines tabu search with a simple perturbation mechanism to ensure a broad exploration of the search space. We also describe a parallel implementation of the heuristic to take advantage of multiple-core processors. Extensive computational results show that the proposed heuristic outperforms tabu search alone and is competitive with recent heuristics designed for each particular problem.

Introduction The purpose of this paper is to present a simple parallel iterated tabu search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and several variants: the periodic VRP (PVRP), the multi-depot VRP (MDVRP), and the site-dependent VRP (SDVRP). The heuristic is also applicable to the corresponding problems with time windows: the VRPTW, the PVRPTW, the MDVRPTW, and the SDVRPTW. The heuristic builds upon the previous work of Cordeau et al. [13] , [14]  and  [15] on tabu search heuristics for VRP variants. It embeds tabu search within iterated local search and uses a simple parallel computing framework to take advantage of the multiple cores available on modern computers. The VRP can be defined on a complete directed graph G=(V,A) G = ( V , A ) , where V={v 0 ,v 1 ,…,v n } V = { v 0 , v 1 , … , v n } is the set of vertices and A={(v i ,v j ):v i ,v j ∈V,i≠j} A = { ( v i , v j ) : v i , v j ∈ V , i ≠ j } is the set of arcs. Vertex v 0 represents the depot while vertices v 1 ,…,v n v 1 , … , v n represent customers. Each customer vertex v i has a non-negative demand q i as well as a non-negative service duration d i . A fleet of m vehicles is available to visit the customers. Vehicle k has a capacity of Q k and the duration of its route cannot exceed D k . With each arc (v i ,v j ) ( v i , v j ) is associated a non-negative cost c ij proportional to the travel time from vertex i to vertex j . The VRP consists in designing m vehicle routes of minimum total cost such that (i) each route starts and ends at the depot; (ii) each customer is visited by exactly one route; and (iii) the total demand of the customers visited by route k does not exceed Q k and its duration does not exceed D k . The VRP is a hard combinatorial optimization problem for which a large number of exact and heuristic algorithms have been proposed in the last decades (see, e.g., [47]  and  [25] ). Among the best performing recent heuristics are the memetic algorithm of Nagata and Bräysy [36] and the iterated local search algorithm of Prins [42] . Another effective algorithm is the general adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) heuristic of Pisinger and Ropke [39] which has been applied not only to the VRP but also to the MDVRP, the SDVRP, the VRPTW, and the Open VRP. Significant progress has also recently been made in terms of exact solution methods. In particular, Baldacci and Mingozzi [2] have introduced a unified approach capable of solving multiple variants of the VRP including the PVRP, MDVRP and SDVRP (see also [3]  and  [4] ). We refer to Laporte [29] for a recent survey on the VRP.
