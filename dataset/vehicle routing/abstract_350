  A column generation approach is presented for the split delivery vehicle routing problem with large demand. Columns include route and delivery amount information. Pricing sub-problems are solved by a limited-search-with-bound algorithm. Feasible solutions are obtained iteratively by fixing one route once. Numerical experiments show better solutions than in the literature. Keywords Split delivery vehicle routing ; Column generation ; Integer programming 1. Introduction The split delivery vehicle routing problem (SDVRP) was introduced to the vehicle routing problem (VRP) literature by [4] in the late 1980s. Unlike the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), the SDVRP allows the delivery to a demand point to be split between two or more vehicles. In many cases, allowing split deliveries results in significant savings both in the total distance traveled and the number of required vehicles compared to the corresponding CVRP solution. An example in [9] shows that the ratio of the optimal value of the SDVRP over that of the corresponding CVRP approaches 1/2 when the number of demand points goes to +∞ + ∞ . The savings are, in general, more significant when average customer demand is large (e.g., more than 10% of the vehicle capacity) [3] . There are a few exact algorithms in the literature to solve small-size SDVRP problems. A dynamic programming (DP) model with infinite state and action spaces is developed in [12] . The largest instance solved by [12] has nine demand points and six vehicles. A two-stage algorithm with valid inequalities is developed by [11] to successfully solve instances with up to 21 points. A cutting-plane algorithm incorporating the valid inequalities in [5] is used to solve small instances with up to 10 demand points optimally. In [2] a polyhedral study of the SDVRP is given and their cutting-plane algorithm with several valid inequalities yields good lower bounds and upper bounds for large instances with up to 100 demand points. The gaps are around 10% for instances with 50, 75, or 100 demand points. The numerical experiments presented in Section 6 use the instances provided by [2] as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the proposed column generation (CG) approach. A Tabu search algorithm is developed in [1] for the SDVRP. Various practical problems are modeled as SDVRPs in the literature, and they are generally solved using heuristic algorithms. Ref. [7] and [8] study the SDVRP and its variation with time windows on a grid network and propose constructive heuristics. A heuristic algorithm is used in [13] for a livestock feed distribution problem encountered on a cattle ranch in Arizona. In [14] an algorithm based on CG techniques is provided along with other heuristics to determine a flight schedule for helicopters to off-shore platform locations for exchanging work crews in the North Sea. The flight schedule does not restrict the number of total trips but has a constraint on the number of total stops in a trip. A CG approach is developed for solving the SDVRP with time windows in [9] . The CG approach proposed in this paper for the general SDVRP is similar to the algorithm, developed for one specific application, presented in [14] . However, our approach is different from that of [14] in the following ways: (1) our approach requires the solutions to use a fixed number of vehicles but does not have a restriction on the longest distance of each trip; (2) the decision variables in our master problem are defined as binary variables rather than general integer variables in order to improve the lower bound; (3) the algorithm to obtain the feasible solution fixes one route with the largest product of variable value and its total delivery amount and guarantees feasibility over iterations; and (4) we conduct numerical experiments on the instances published in [2] and show that the CG approach provides good results for instances with large average demand.
