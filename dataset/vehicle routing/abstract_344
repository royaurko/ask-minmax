In this paper, a sanitation routing problem called the Rollonâ€“Rolloff Vehicle Routing Problem (RRVRP) is defined. In the RRVRP, tractors move large trailers between locations and a disposal facility. The trailers are so large that the tractor can only transport one trailer at a time. In this paper, the RRVRP is defined, a mathematical programming formulation is presented, and two lower bounds and four heuristic algorithms are developed and tested on 20 different problems. Conclusions are derived and recommendations for further research are presented.
