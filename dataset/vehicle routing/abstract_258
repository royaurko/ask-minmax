New assignment algorithms for the multi-depot vehicle routing problem Authors: Giosa, I.D.; Tansini, I.L.; Viera, I.O.; Correspondence Source: Journal of the Operational Research Society , Volume 53, Number 9, 1 September 2002, pp. 977-984(8)   Abstract: This paper considers the design and analysis of algorithms for the multi-depot vehicle routing problem with time windows (MDVRPTW). Given the intrinsic difficulty of this problem class, approximation methods of the type ‘cluster first, route second’ (two-step approaches) seem to offer the most promise for practical size problems. After describing six heuristics for the cluster part (assignment of customers to depots) an initial computational study of their performance is conducted. Finding, as expected, that the heuristics with the best results (in terms of the routing results) are those with the largest computational efforts.
