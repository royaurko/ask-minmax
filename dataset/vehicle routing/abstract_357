Volume 43 of the series Operations Research/Computer Science Interfaces pp 103-122 The Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem: A Survey Claudia Archetti Affiliated with Department of Quantitative Methods, University of Brescia   Email author   , Maria Grazia Speranza Affiliated with Department of Quantitative Methods, University of Brescia In the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) a fleet of capacitated vehicles is available to serve a set of customers with known demand. Each customer is required to be visited by exactly one vehicle and the objective is to minimize the total distance traveled. In the Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (SDVRP) the restriction that each customer has to be visited exactly once is removed, i.e., split deliveries are allowed. In this chapter we present a survey of the state-of-the-art on the SDVRP. Key words Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem Survey Computational Complexity Algorithms
