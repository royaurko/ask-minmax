Improved Genetic Algorithm for Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows ZHANG Li-ping,CHAI Yue-ting,CAO Rui (Dept. of Automation,Tsinghua Univ.,Beijing 100084,China)   We state a universal mathematical model of vehicle routing problem with time windows,which can satisfy numerous practical requirements and transform into other typical combination optimal problems by setting different parameters.An improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is proposed based on the novel crossover operator.IGA avoids effectively the common defects of early convergence and the diversity of population in traditional genetic algorithm.This algorithm can find the optimal or nearly optimal solution to the vehicle routing problem with time windows effectively,which is proved bya number of experiments. 【Key Words】： mathematical model genetic algorithm vehicle routing problem with time windows crossover operator population diversity early convergence 【CateGory Index】： TP18 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 10 Hits 1 Liu Yunzhong,Xuan Huiyu(Management School of Xi'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an 710049,China); Application Research on Vehicle Routing Problem With Time Windows Based on Dynamic Ant Algorithm [J];Engineering Science;2005-12 2 LIU Yun-zhang, XUAN Hui-yu(Management School of Xi'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an 710049,China); Summarizing Research on Models and Algorithms for Vehicle Routing Problem [J];Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management;2005-01 3 LI Yong-xian 1,2,HU Xiang-pei 1,XIONG Ying 11 Institute of System Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116023,China2 School of Management, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian 116029,China; Simulation and Optimization of Vehicle Routing Problems in Logistics Distribution Systems and Its Research Progress [J];Management Sciences in China;2006-04 4 WU Yong1,YE Chun-ming1,MA Hui-min1,2,XIA Meng-yu1 1.College of Management,University of Shanghai for Science and Technology,Shanghai 200093,China 2.Business School,Shanghai Dianji University,Shanghai 200245,China; Parallel particle swarm optimization algorithm for vehicle routing problems with time windows [J];Computer Engineering and Applications;2007-14 5 SUN Xia,HUANG Xi-yue,YANG Zu-yuan,XIANG Chang-cheng College of Automation,Chongqing University,Chongqing 400030,China; Improved GA-based dynamic optimal routing in urban traffic system [J];Computer Engineering and Applications;2007-30 6 ZHANG Ruifeng1,2 (1.School of Management,Tianjin University,Tianjin 300072;2.School of Finance and Taxation,Hebei University of Economics & Business,Shijiazhuang 050061); Solution to Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window Based on Hybrid Genetic Algorithm [J];Computer Engineering;2007-14 7 ZHAO Yan-wei~1, WU Bin~1, JIANG Li~2, DONG Hong-zhao~1, WANG Wan-liang~1(1.Dep. of Mechanical Eng., Zhejiang Univ. of Tech., Hangzhou310014, China; 2.Dep. of Computer Sci., Hangzhou Univ. of Commerce, Hangzhou310032, China); Double Populations Genetic Algorithm for Vehicle Routing Problem [J];Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems;2004-03 8 LIU Xiao-lan, HAO Zhi-feng, WANG Guo-qiang, FU Ke-qiang (Dep.of Applied Mathematics, South China Univ.of Tech., Guangzhou510640, China); Improved large neighborhood search algorithm for vehicle routing problem with time windows [J];Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems;2004-07 9 WAN Xu , LIN Jian-liang , YANG Xiao-wei (Dep. of Applied Mathematics,South China Univ. of Tech.,Guangzhou 510640,China); Improved MMAS for vehicle routing problem with time window [J];Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems;2005-04 10 XIAO Jian-mei, LI Jun-jun, WANG Xi-huai (Dep. of Electrical and Automation, Shanghai Maritime Univ., Shanghai 200135, China); Modified particle swarm optimization algorithm for vehicle routing problem1 [J];Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems;2005-04 【Citations】 1 Li Jun; A Heuristic for Vehicle Routing with Time Windows [J];Systems Engineering;1996-05 【Co-citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 10 Hits 1 LUO Xiao-bin,YANG Rong-hao,DENG Hu-cheng(School of Computer Science & Comm.
