This paper is a survey of the literature on applications of evolutionary algorithms for vehicle routing problems. It reports on genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, and particle swarm optimization when applied to the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem and many of its variants. The performance of evolutionary algorithms is also compared with the best alternative problem-solving approaches on benchmark instances.
