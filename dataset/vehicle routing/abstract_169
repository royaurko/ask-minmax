Abstract: City logistics is the process of totally optimising urban logistics activities by considering the social, environmental, economic, financial and energy impacts of urban freight movement. This book focuses on modelling City Logistics. Highlighted are the formulation of mathematical models of vehicle routing and scheduling with Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), optimal terminal locations and impact estimation by City Logistics measures. The book presents a theoretical and practical treatment of modelling City Logistics based on ITS and the Global Positioning and Geographical Information Systems.
