Modified particle swarm optimization algorithm for vehicle routing problem1 XIAO Jian-mei, LI Jun-jun, WANG Xi-huai (Dep. of Electrical and Automation, Shanghai Maritime Univ., Shanghai 200135, China)   Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is a powerful method to find the extremum of a continuous numerical function. A method based on PSO was researched to solve the discrete Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The VRP was changed into a quasi-continuous problem by designing a new real coding. Constrained terms in VRP were processed by the penalty function. This proposed algorithm was applied to illustrate its higher searching efficiency in comparison with standard genetic algorithm double populations genetic algorithm for VRP. Simulation results of several VRP examples demonstrated the effectiveness of this algorithm. 【Key Words】： vehicle routing problem particle swarm optimization real coding combination optimization 【Fund】： 国家自然科学基金资助项目(60074004);;
