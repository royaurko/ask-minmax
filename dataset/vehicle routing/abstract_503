  The developments in mobile communication technologies are a strong motivation for the study of dynamic vehicle routing and scheduling problems. In particular, the planned routes can be quickly modified to account for the occurrence of new customer requests, which might imply diverting a vehicle away from its current destination. In this paper, a previously developed problem-solving approach for a vehicle routing problem with dynamic requests and dynamic travel times is extended to account for more sophisticated communication means between the drivers and the central dispatch office. Computational results are reported to empirically demonstrate the benefits of this extension. Keywords Dynamic vehicle routing ; Time windows ; Travel times ; Diversion 1. Introduction The recent developments observed in communication facilities have led us to consider a dynamic vehicle routing problem where new customer requests must be inserted in the currently planned routes as soon as they occur [1]  and  [2] . A good survey about methodologies for solving different types of dynamic vehicle routing problems can be found in [3] . In this paper, additional elements related to travel times are considered in addition to new customer requests. First, the travel times are time-dependent to account for rush hours [4] , [5] , [6]  and  [7] . Second, dynamic perturbations are introduced to account for unforeseen congestion due, for example, to accidents or difficult meteorological conditions [8]  and  [9] . As opposed to the time-dependency component, these perturbations are not known in advance. We propose an extension to the model in [9] which assumes that communication between the drivers and the dispatch office can only take place at customer locations. Here, it is assumed that the dispatch office can communicate with the drivers to get their current position when a new customer request is received or when one of the drivers does not report at his current destination at the planned time (plus some tolerance, see Section 3 ). This new context leads to diversion opportunities, because the vehicle can be redirected to another customer location without ever reaching its current destination [3] , [10] , [11]  and  [12] . The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , the dynamic vehicle routing problem is introduced with a description of its two dynamic components, namely travel times and customer requests. In Section 3 , the model proposed in [9] is briefly discussed, in particular the concept of tolerance to delays. The model is then extended in Section 4 to account for the possibility to communicate with the drivers when the current situation departs from the planned schedule. Computational results are reported in Section 5 to measure the benefits of the extended model, followed by concluding remarks in Section 6 . 2. Problem definition
