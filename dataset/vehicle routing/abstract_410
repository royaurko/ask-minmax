Date: 23 August 2002 Insertion Based Ants for Vehicle Routing Problems with Backhauls and Time Windows Marc Reimann Affiliated with Institute of Management Science, University of Vienna , Karl Doerner Affiliated with Institute of Management Science, University of Vienna , Richard F. Hartl Affiliated with Institute of Management Science, University of Vienna In this paper we present and analyze the application of an Ant System to the Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and Time Windows (VRPBTW). At the core of the algorithm we use an Insertion procedure to construct solutions. We provide results on the learning and runtime behavior of the algorithm as well as a comparison with a custom made heuristic for the problem.
