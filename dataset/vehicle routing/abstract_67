  The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) requires the determination of an optimal set of routes for a set of vehicles to serve a set of customers. We deal here with the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) where there is a maximum weight or volume that each vehicle can load. We developed an Ant Colony algorithm (ACO) for the CVRP based on the metaheuristic technique introduced by Colorni, Dorigo and Maniezzo. We present preliminary results that show that ant algorithms are competitive with other metaheuristics for solving CVRP.
