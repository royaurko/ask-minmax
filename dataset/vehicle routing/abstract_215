This article discusses the substantial recent progress made by researchers and practitioners in the field of computer-assisted vehicle routing. We focus on advances in routing methodology and the uses of this new technology in concrete practical environments. In particular, we discuss successful implementations, advances in model realism, and new algorithmic techniques, and we speculate on the future of this field.
