Ant searching algorithm for vehicle routing problem CUI Xue-li, MA Liang, FAN Bing-quan (School of Management, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai 200093, China)   Vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a typical NP_hard problem in combinatorial optimization. Theoretically speaking, only relatively small_sized problems can be solved to get the optimal solution. Based on the recently developed new intelligent optimization idea: artificial ant system, we proposes a quick ant searching algorithm for solving VRP. After defining the basic state transition probabilities of artificial ants and combining the local searching strategy, we uses the number of iterations to control the running time of the algorithm. Therefore, the method can be implemented with practicality. Series of numerical examples were tested and verified, which shows the better performance of the proposed algorithm compared with some classical algorithms. 【Key Words】： VRP ant algorithm searching 【Fund】： 上海市曙光计划资助项目(2000SG30). 【CateGory Index】： O224 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats;
