  In this research the vehicle routing problem is extended to the vehicle routing problem with trailers. The optimal deployment of a vehicle fleet of truck-trailer combinations is investigated. Truck-trailer combinations may encounter manoeuvring problems at certain customer sites. Therefore the opportunity is introduced to leave the trailer at a parking-place and visit some ‘difficult’ customers with the easy manoeuvrable truck only. Construction and improvement heuristics are presented. Keywords Routing ; Vehicle routing problem ; Heuristics ; Trailers Fisher and Jaikumar, 1981 M.L. Fisher, R.
