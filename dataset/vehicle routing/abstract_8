  This paper describes an insertion algorithm for the Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Problem with Time Windows (VRSPTW). This algorithm builds routes in parallel and uses a generalized regret measure over all unrouted customers in order to select the next candidate for insertion. Numerical results on the standard set of problems of Solomon are reported as well as comparisons with his sequential algorithm (Solomon, 1987).
