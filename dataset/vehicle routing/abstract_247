We consider the asymmetric capacitated vehicle routing problem ( CVRP ), a particular case of the standard asymmetric vehicle routing problem in which only the vehicle capacity constraints are imposed. CVRP is known to be NP-hard and finds practical applications in distribution and scheduling. We describe two new bounding procedures for CVRP , based on the so-called additive approach . Each procedure computes a sequence of nondecreasing lower bounds, obtained by solving different relaxations of CVRP . Effective implementations of the procedures are also outlined which considerably reduce the computational effort. The two procedures are combined into an overall bounding algorithm. A branch-and-bound exact algorithm is then proposed, whose performance is enhanced by means of reduction procedures, dominance criteria, and feasibility checks. Extensive computational results on both real-world and random test problems are presented, showing that the proposed approach favorably compares with previous algorithms from the literature.
