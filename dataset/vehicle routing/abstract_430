Volume 4446 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 142-153 Edge Assembly Crossover for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem YuichiÂ Nagata Affiliated with Graduate School of Information Sciences, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology We propose an evolutionary algorithm (EA) that applies to the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). The EA uses edge assembly crossover (EAX) which was originally designed for the traveling salesman problem (TSP). EAX can be straightforwardly extended to the CVRP if the constraint of the vehicle capacity is not considered. To address the constraint violation, the penalty function method with 2-opt and Interchange neighborhoods is incorporated into the EA. Moreover, a local search is also incorporated into the EA. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EA can effectively find the best-known solutions on Christofides benchmark. Moreover, our EA found ten new best solutions for Golden instances in a reasonable computation time.
