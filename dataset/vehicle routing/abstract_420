We consider the multidepot capacitated vehicle routing problems and analyze the tour partitioning heuristics for different versions of the model. We prove that the worst-case ratios of the heuristics are bounded by some fixed numbers. Examples are provided to show that the worst-case bounds are tight or asymptotically tight for almost all versions.
