Volume 38 of the series Operations Research/Computer Science Interfaces Series pp 19-40 Classification Of Dynamic Vehicle Routing Systems Allan Larsen Affiliated with Centre for Traffic and Transport, Technical University of Denmark , Oli B.G. Madsen Affiliated with Centre for Traffic and Transport, Technical University of Denmark , Marius M. Solomon Affiliated with Department of Management Sciences, College of Business Administration, Northeastern University This chapter discusses important characteristics seen within dynamic vehicle routing problems. We discuss the differences between the traditional static vehicle routing problems and its dynamic counterparts. We give an in-depth introduction to the degree of dynamism measure which can be used to classify dynamic vehicle routing systems. Methods for evaluation of the performance of algorithms that solve on-line routing problems are discussed and we list some of the most important issues to include in the system objective. Finally, we provide a three-echelon classification of dynamic vehicle routing systems based on their degree of dynamism and the system objective Keywords degree of dynamism dynamic vehicle routing competitive analysis
