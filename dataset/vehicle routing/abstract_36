This paper is the second part of a work on the application of new search techniques for the vehicle routing problem with time windows. It describes GENEROUS, the GENEtic ROUting System, which is based on the natural evolution paradigm. Under this paradigm, a population of solutions evolves from one generation to the next by “mating” parent solutions to form new offspring solutions that exhibit characteristics inherited from their parents. For this vehicle routing application, a specialized methodology is devised for merging two vehicle routing solutions into a single solution that is likely to be feasible with respect to the time window constraints. Computational results on a standard set of test problems are reported, and comparisons are provided with other heuristics.
