A Two-stage Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows. Source: International Journal of Advancements in Computing Technology . Jan2012, Vol. 4 Issue 1, p485-491. 7p. Author(s): Xudong Wu Abstract: The vehicle routing problem with time windows is a NP-hard problem which has a wide range of use in practice. The proposed optimization algorithm of this paper is based on ant colony optimization algorithm, and has two independent stages. The goal of the first stage is to minimize the number of vehicles, and in the second stage the total distance of all routes is minimized by means of local search method. The approach was tested by standard Solomon problems and the result shows that this two- stage ant colony optimization algorithm is better than other heuristic algorithms in some problems.
