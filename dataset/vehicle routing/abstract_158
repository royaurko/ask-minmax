Password: We consider a vehicle routing problem with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles having various capacities, fixed costs and variable costs. An approach based on column generation (CG) is applied for its solution, hitherto successful only in the vehicle routing problem with time windows. A tight integer programming model is presented, the linear programming relaxation of which is solved by the CG technique. A couple of dynamic programming schemes developed for the classical vehicle routing problem are emulated with some modifications to efficiently generate feasible columns. With the tight lower bounds thereby obtained, the branch-and-bound procedure is activated to obtain an integer solution. Computational experience with the benchmark test instances confirms that our approach outperforms all the existing algorithms both in terms of the quality of solutions generated and the solution time.

Introduction We consider the heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem (HVRP), a variant of the classical vehicle routing problem (VRP). The HVRP differs from the classical VRP in that it deals with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles having various capacities, fixed costs and variable costs. Therefore, the HVRP involves designing a set of vehicle routes, each starting and ending at the depot, for a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles which services a set of customers with known demands. Each customer is visited exactly once, and the total demand of a route does not exceed the capacity of the vehicle type assigned to it. The routing cost of a vehicle is the sum of its fixed cost and a variable cost incurred proportionately to the travel distance. The objective is to minimize the total of such routing costs. The number of available vehicles of each type is assumed to be unlimited. In the literature, three HVRP versions have been studied. The first one was introduced by Golden et al. [1] , in which variable costs are uniformly given over all vehicle types with the number of available vehicles assumed to be unlimited for each type. This version is also called the vehicle fleet mix (VFM) [2] , the fleet size and mix VRP [1] or the fleet size and composition VRP [3] . The second version considers the variable costs, dependent on vehicle type, which is neglected in the first version. This version is the one dealt with in this paper, and referred to as the HVRP [4] , the VFM with variable unit running costs [5] or the mix fleet VRP [6] . The third one, called the VRP with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles [7] or the heterogeneous fixed fleet VRP [8] , generalizes the second version by limiting the number of available vehicles of each type. All the HVRP variants are NP-hard as they include the classical VRP as a special case. All the existing studies have thus focused on developing heuristic algorithms instead of exact solution methods. They can be broadly grouped into two kinds: classical heuristics [1] , [2] , [3] , [5] , [9]  and  [10] mostly derived from the classical VRP heuristics, and meta-heuristics like the tabu search method [4] , [6] , [7]  and  [8] (see [2]  and  [10] for a review of HVRP variants). Interestingly, the performances of the heuristics have all been tested, with a few exceptions, on two sets of benchmark instances: the first one consisting of the 20 VFM instances given by Golden et al. [1] and the second containing 8 instances only with variable costs by Taillard [7] . From among such heuristics, the tabu search heuristic of Taillard [7] performed the best for the first set, while that of Gendreau et al. [4] outperformed the others for the second set. Namely, there is no single dominating heuristic for both sets. It is noteworthy that not only can all the generated solutions not be guaranteed with their optimality but also they fail to produce any tight lower bounds, a key criterion on how close their solutions are to optimality. Some studies attempted to formulate the HVRP as an integer programming (IP) model using arc flow variables. The arc flow models in [2]  and  [11] have, however, received little attention, since the lower bounds obtained from the linear programming (LP) relaxation are loose. Another notable attempt is the set partitioning model by Taillard [7] . Its LP relaxation, although known to be tight, cannot be solved to optimality by his tabu search heuristic applied in the column generation (CG) process. This observation motivates us to deal with the HVRP with the LP-based CG approach, reported to be successful for the VRP with time windows (VRPTW) [12]  and  [13] . The HVRP is first formulated as a set covering model as done for the VRPTW [12]  and  [14] . We then solve its LP relaxation by the CG technique. A couple of dynamic programming (DP) schemes developed for the classical VRP [15]  and  [16] are emulated with some modifications to efficiently generate feasible columns. Based on the tight lower bounds thereby obtained, the branch-and-bound procedure is activated with the columns generated while solving the LP relaxation. As will be demonstrated, our approach outperforms all the existing algorithms both in terms of the quality of solutions generated and the solution time, for all the test instances. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: after describing the HVRP, we give an IP model, followed by its reformulation tailored for the CG technique. Then the DP subproblem generating columns is presented. A couple of schemes for solving the subproblem modified from the approach for the VRPTW are elaborated, with further technical details on implementing the procedure. Computational results are given, followed by the conclusion. 2. Formulation of the problem
