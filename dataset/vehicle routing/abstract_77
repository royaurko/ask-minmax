This paper considers the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands. The objective is to provide an overview of this problem, and to examine a variety of solution methodologies. The concepts and the main issues are reviewed along with some properties of optimal solutions. The existing stochastic mathematical programming formulations are presented and compared and a new formulation is proposed. A new solution framework for the problem using Markovian decision processes is then presented.
