Password: This paper presents a new model and solution for multi-objective vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) using goal programming and genetic algorithm that in which decision maker specifies optimistic aspiration levels to the objectives and deviations from those aspirations are minimized. VRPTW involves the routing of a set of vehicles with limited capacity from a central depot to a set of geographically dispersed customers with known demands and predefined time windows. This paper uses a direct interpretation of the VRPTW as a multi-objective problem where both the total required fleet size and total traveling distance are minimized while capacity and time windows constraints are secured. The present work aims at using a goal programming approach for the formulation of the problem and an adapted efficient genetic algorithm to solve it. In the genetic algorithm various heuristics incorporate local exploitation in the evolutionary search and the concept of Pareto optimality for the multi-objective optimization. Moreover part of initial population is initialized randomly and part is initialized using Push Forward Insertion Heuristic and λ-interchange mechanism. The algorithm is applied to solve the benchmark Solomon's 56 VRPTW 100-customer instances. Results show that the suggested approach is quiet effective, as it provides solutions that are competitive with the best known in the literature.

Introduction Vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is a variant of vehicle routing problem (VRP) with adding time windows constraints to the model. VRP is one of the most attractive topics in operation research and deals with determination of the least cost routes from a central depot to a set of geographically dispersed customers. Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are well known combinatorial optimization problems arising in transportation logistic that usually involve scheduling in constrained environments. In transportation management, there is a requirement to provide goods and/or service from a supply point to various geographically dispersed points with significant economic implications. Because of many applications of different kinds of VRP, many researchers have focused to develop solution approaches for these problems. Likewise, useful techniques for the general VRP could be found in [10] , [15] , [38]  and  [43] . In VRPTW, a set of vehicles with limited capacity is to be routed from a central depot to a set of geographically dispersed customers with known demands and predefined time windows in order that fleet size of vehicles and total traveling distance are minimized and capacity and time windows constraints are not violated. Due to its inherent complexities and usefulness in real life, the VRPTW continues to draw attention from researchers and has become a well-known problem in network optimization, so many authors developed different solution approaches based on exact and heuristics methods. In terms of exact algorithms [41] , presented modern branch and cut techniques for routing problems. Also exact approach using Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition for the VRPTW can be found in [26] . Kohl's work [42] is one of the most efficient exact methods for the VRPTW; it succeeded in solving various 100-customer size instances. However, no algorithm has been developed to date that can solve to optimality all VRPTW instances with 100 customers or more. It should be noted that exact methods are more efficient in the situations where the solution space is restricted by narrow time windows; since there are fewer combinations of customers to define feasible routes [35] . Hence, many researchers have investigated the VRPTW using Heuristics and Meta-heuristics approaches. These approaches seek for approximate solutions in polynomial time instead of exact solutions which would be at intolerably high cost. Various heuristic methods may be found in literature for VRPTW in [30]  and  [48] . In this area, [52]  and  [50] solved VRPTW with simulated annealing, [51] , [12]  and  [21] solved VRPTW with tabu search and [35] applied multiple ant colony system for VRPTW, and [7] , [18] , [27] , [19] , [31] , [14] , [32]  and  [49] used genetic algorithm for VRPTW. In applying genetic algorithm, [25] presented two new crossover operators, Merge Cross#1 and Merge Cross#2, and showed that the new operators are superior to traditional crossovers operators. A cluster-first, route-second method using genetic algorithm and local search optimization process was implemented by Thangiah [48] . Comparative studies of the performance of genetic algorithm, tabu search and simulated annealing for the VRPTW is given in [30]  and  [48] . Other heuristics that have been applied to the VRPTW include constraint programming and local search [4]  and  [44] . Other very good techniques and applications of VRPTW can be found in [13] , [5] , [33] , [20] , [45]  and  [3] . Although literature of the VRPTW is rich in exact and heuristics solution approaches and models dealing with a single point of view, e.g., a comprehensive profit index (or a comprehensive cost index) representing the preferability (or dis-preferability) of the considered actions [23]  and  [6] , not many could be found that deal with multiple objective vehicle routing problem with time windows especially the ones that solve the problem in a polynomial time and take into consideration the opinions of the decision maker in the decision process. In the multi-objective area, Tan et al. [31] proposed a hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (HMOEA) that incorporates various heuristics for local exploitation in the evolutionary search and the concept of Pareto's optimality for solving the multi-objective VRPTW optimization. Unlike the works [22]  and  [34] that were designed for parameterized problems, [31] featured with specialized genetic operators and variable-length chromosome representation to accommodate the sequence-oriented optimization in VRPTW and produced very good result on Solomon's 56 benchmark problems. Another similar study in this area is [7] which employed different and efficient operators to produce good results. Gambardella et al. [35] studied a type of multi-objective implementation of the VRPTW by minimizing a hierarchical objective function, where the first objective minimized the number of vehicles and the second minimized the total travel time. This was achieved by adapting the ant colony system (ACS) [36] . Another research in the area is [8] that applied a hybrid search based on GA and tabu search to the soft VRPTW. While good results were obtained, the approach was two-phased: a GA was first used to set the number of vehicles, and then a local tabu search employed to minimize the total cost of the distance traveled. This paper studies a bi-objective VRPTW which is modeled by a goal programming approach and implemented with a genetic algorithm. In this study, simultaneous minimization of the number of vehicles and the total traveling distance are considered as the objective functions. The basic idea in this paper is that the decision maker specifies optimistic aspiration levels to the objective functions of the problem and deviations from these aspiration levels are minimized. The problem is modeled in goal programming and a well-established genetic algorithm is developed and implemented to effectively solve the problem. Goal programming approach (GP) is the most popular of methodologies for dealing with multi-objective programming problems and is a concept of satisfying the objectives, i.e., to seek a solution that comes as near as possible to the goals. For this propose a target level is established by decision maker which represents his/her preferences in relevant to acceptable level of achievement for each objective. Deviational variables are defined in order to represent the deviation amount from the target value. This model is a branch of multiple objective programming, which in turn is a branch of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), also known as multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM). It can be thought of as an extension or generalization of linear programming to handle multiple, normally conflicting objective measures. The initial goal programming formulations ordered the unwanted deviations into a number of priority levels, with the minimization of a deviation in a higher priority level being of infinitely more important than any deviations in lower priority levels. This is known as lexicographic or pre-emptive goal programming. Lexicographic goal programming should be used when there is a clear priority ordering amongst the goals to be achieved. If the decision maker is more interested in direct comparisons of the objectives then Weighted or non-pre-emptive goal programming should be used. In this case all the unwanted deviations are multiplied by weights, reflecting their relative importance, and added together as a single sum to form the achievement function. Goal programming was first used by Charnes et al. [1] in 1955, although the actual name first appeared in a 1961 text by Charnes and Cooper [2] . Seminal works by [47] , [28]  and  [9] were followed. Scniederjans [39] gave in a bibliography of a large number of pre-1995 articles relating to goal programming and Jones and Tamiz gave an annotated bibliography of the period 1990–2000 [11] .
