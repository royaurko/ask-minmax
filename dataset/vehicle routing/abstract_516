The VRP is an NP-hard problem that comes in many guises. The VRP literature contains thousands of papers, and VRP research is regarded as one of the great successes of OR. Vehicle routing decision support tools provide substantial savings in society every day, and an industry of routing tool vendors has emerged. Exact methods of today cannot consistently solve VRP instances with more than 50–100 customers in reasonable time, which is generally a small number in real-life applications. For industrial problem sizes, and if one aims at solving a variety of VRP variants, approximation methods is the only viable approach. There is still a need for VRP research, particularly for large-scale instances and complex, rich VRP variants. In this chapter, we give a brief general introduction to the VRP. We then describe how industrial requirements motivate extensions to the basic, rather idealized VRP models that have received most attention in the research community, and how such extensions can be made. At SINTEF Applied Mathematics, industrial variants of the VRP have been studied since 1995. Our efforts have led to the development of a generic VRP solver that has been commercialized through a spin-off company. We give a description of the underlying, rich VRP model and the selected uniform algorithmic approach, which is based on metaheuristics. Finally, results from computational experiments are presented. In conclusion, we point to important issues in further VRP research. Key words Transportation Logistics Optimization VRP Modeling Approximation Metaheuristics Routing Tool
