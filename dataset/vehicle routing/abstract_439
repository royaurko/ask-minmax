Via Jr. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University This paper describes an “intelligent” system designed to make “real-time” decisions regarding route shapes for situations in which locations of the depot, nodes to be served and vehicle capacity are known, and the demand at the nodes is only approximated. The model developed is based on the combination of the new computational paradigm — the Bee System and Fuzzy Logic. The results are found to be very close to the best solution assuming that the future node demand pattern is known. The system applications appear to be very promising.
