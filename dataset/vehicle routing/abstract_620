This paper proposes a novel version of the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Instead of servicing all the customers, feasible solutions of the VRP instance are forced to satisfy a set of complex high-level tasks given as a metric temporal logic (MTL) specification, which allows complex quantitative timing constraints to be incorporated into the problem. For the resulting vehicle routing problem with metric temporal logic specifications (VRPMTL), a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) based algorithm is provided that solves the problem to optimality. Examples for optimal multi-UAV mission planning are provided where MTL is used as a high level language to specify complex mission tasks.
