Relation between vehicle routing problems: an insertion heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pick-up applied to the vehicle routing problem with backhauls Authors: Dethloff, J.; Correspondence Source: Journal of the Operational Research Society , Volume 53, Number 1, 1 January 2002, pp. 115-118(4)   Abstract: Recently, an increasing number of papers on vehicle routing problems with backhauling has been published. Different types of backhauling problems are discussed. Two of them—the vehicle routing problem with backhauls and so-called ‘mixed loads’ (VRPBM) and the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pick-up (VRPSDP)—are closely related. In this paper, we discuss that relationship. Our findings are that previously published results for VRPSDP instances obtained by using a heuristic suggested for the VRPBM do not take into account specific properties of the VRPSDP. As a result of the analysis of the relation between both problem types the possibility of solving the VRPBM by applying an insertion heuristic based on the concept of ‘residual capacities’ originally designed for the VRPSDP is investigated. Numerical results indicate that, for certain instances, this approach is more favourable than the application of a heuristic suggested for the VRPBM in the literature.
