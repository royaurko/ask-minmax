Password: The paper considers a version of the vehicle routing problem where customers’ demands are uncertain. The focus is on dynamically routing a single vehicle to serve the demands of a known set of geographically dispersed customers during real-time operations. The goal consists of minimizing the expected distance traveled in order to serve all customers’ demands. Since actual demand is revealed upon arrival of the vehicle at the location of each customer, fully exploiting this feature requires a dynamic approach. This work studies the suitability of the emerging field of neuro-dynamic programming (NDP) in providing approximate solutions to this difficult stochastic combinatorial optimization problem. The paper compares the performance of two NDP algorithms: optimistic approximate policy iteration and a rollout policy. While the former improves the performance of a nearest-neighbor policy by 2.3%, the computational results indicate that the rollout policy generates higher quality solutions. The implication for the practitioner is that the rollout policy is a promising candidate for vehicle routing applications where a dynamic approach is required. Scope and purpose Recent years have seen a growing interest in the development of vehicle routing algorithms to cope with the uncertain and dynamic situations found in real-world applications (see the recent survey paper by Powell et al. [1] ). As noted by Psaraftis [2] , dramatic advances in information and communication technologies provide new possibilities and opportunities for vehicle routing research and applications. The enhanced capability of capturing the information that becomes available during real-time operations opens up new research directions. This informational availability provides the possibility of developing dynamic routing algorithms that take advantage of the information that is dynamically revealed during operations. Exploiting such information presents a significant challenge to the operations research/management science community. The single vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands [3] provides an example of a simple, yet very difficult to solve exactly, dynamic vehicle routing problem . The problem can be formulated as a stochastic shortest path problem [4] characterized by an enormous number of states. Neuro-dynamic programming [5]  and  [6] is a recent methodology that can be used to approximately solve very large and complex stochastic decision and control problems. In this spirit, this paper is meant to study the applicability of neuro-dynamic programming algorithms to the single-vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands.

Introduction The deterministic vehicle routing problem (VRP) is well studied in the operations research literature (see [3] , [7] , [8] , [9]  and  [10] for reviews). Given a set of geographically dispersed customers, each showing a positive demand for a given commodity, VRP consists of finding a set of tours of minimum length for a fleet of vehicles located at a central depot, such that customers’ demands are satisfied and vehicles’ capacities are not exceeded. This work deals with a variation where customers’ demands are uncertain and are assumed to follow given discrete probability distributions. This situation arises in practice whenever a distribution company faces the problem of deliveries to a set of customers, whose demands are uncertain. This work focuses on deliveries, but all the discussion carries through in case of collections. The problem of finding a tour through the customers that minimizes expected distance traveled is known as the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (SVRP for short) [11] , [12] , [13]  and  [14] . Other authors have considered the additional case where the presence of customers is also uncertain (i.e., customers are present with a known probability). This variation is known as the vehicle routing problem with stochastic customers and demands [12] , [14] , [15]  and  [16] . This paper only considers the case of stochastic demands. Stochastic vehicle routing problems may be employed to model a number of business situations that arise in the area of distribution. Some examples follow (note that some of the references do not necessarily indicate a stochastic or dynamic formulation). In a strategic planning scenario, after having identified some major customers a distribution company might be interested in estimating the expected amount of travel to serve these customers on a typical day [12] . Central banks face the problem of delivering money to branches or automatic teller machines whose requirements vary on a daily basis [17] . In less-than-truckload operations the amount of goods to be collected on any given day from a set of customers is generally uncertain [15] . Other examples of applications reported in the literature include the delivery of home heating oil [18] , sludge disposal [19] , the design of a “hot meals” delivery system [20] , and routing of forklifts in a cargo terminal or in a warehouse [12] . Psaraftis [2] provides examples of more “dynamic” situations, where the time dimension is an essential feature of the problem: courier services, intermodal services, tram ship operations, combined pickup and delivery services, and management of container terminals. Most works in the literature [14] dealing with versions of the stochastic VRP focus on computing a fixed order of customers’ visitation, eventually supplemented by decision rules on when to return to the depot to replenish, in anticipation of route failures. A route failure occurs when, due to the variability associated with customers’ demands, the vehicle capacity is exceeded. Recourse actions are taken when a route failure occurs. A popular recourse action employed in the literature consists of having the vehicle return to the depot, replenish and resume its tour from the location where the failure occurred. More specifically, properties and formulations of the problem are investigated by Dror et al. [11] , Dror [21] , and Bastian and Rinnooy Kan [22] . Bertsimas [12] proposes an asymptotically optimal heuristic, and an expression to efficiently compute the expected length of a tour. Bertsimas et al. [13] investigate the empirical behavior of this heuristic, and enhance it by using dynamic programming (DP) to supplement the a priori tour with rules for selecting return trips to the depot. Yang et al. [23] extend this approach to the multi-vehicle case when the length of each tour cannot exceed a given threshold. Secomandi [24] develops rollout algorithms to improve on any initial tour. A simulated annealing heuristic is proposed by Teodorović and Pavković [25] . Other heuristics are developed by Dror and Trudeau [26] , Dror et al. [27] , and Bouzaı̈ene-Ayari et al. [28] . Gendreau et al. [15] propose an exact algorithm based on the integer L-shaped method of Laporte and Louveaux [29] for the case of both stochastic customers and demands. They also derive a DP-based algorithm to compute the expected length of a tour. The same authors [16] develop a tabu search heuristic to be used in case of large size instances. The chance constrained version of the problem is considered by Golden and Yee [30] , Stewart and Golden [31] , and Laporte et al. [32] . These approaches, with the partial exception of Bertsimas et al. [13] , Yang et al. [23] , and Secomandi [24] treat the problem as static, whereby the order of customers’ visitation is not changed during its real-time execution when the actual demands’ realizations become available. The recent survey by Psaraftis [2] emphasizes the effect on the field of vehicle routing of dramatic advances in computer-based technology, such as electronic data interchange, geographic information systems, global positioning systems, and intelligent vehicle-highway systems. He stresses the concept that the enhanced availability of real-time data allowed by these technologies opens new challenges and research directions for the operations research/management science community. In particular, such technologies provide the necessary informational support for developing dynamic vehicle routing algorithms that can exploit the wealth of information that becomes available during real-time operations. The work of Powell et al. [1] provides an excellent review of dynamic and stochastic routing problems from an operations research/management science perspective. In this context, Psaraftis presents the work of Dror et al. [11] as the first dynamic formulation of SVRP. He considers this model as a simple, yet difficult to solve exactly, dynamic routing problem. These authors develop a large-scale Markov decision process (MDP) model for SVRP, but no computational experience is provided. A slightly modified version of this model is discussed by Dror [21] . No computational experience is performed, and the author considers instances with more than three customers as computationally intractable (a comment also made by Dror et al. [27] ). Secomandi [24] reformulates the problem as a stochastic shortest path problem (SSPP) and by exploiting a state-space decomposition develops an exact DP algorithm that can solve small instances (about 10 customers) to optimality. He also derives properties of the optimal policy.
