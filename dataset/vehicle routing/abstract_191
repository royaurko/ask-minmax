This paper examines the value of real-time traffic information to optimal vehicle routing in a nonstationary stochastic network. We present a systematic approach to aid in the implementation of transportation systems integrated with real-time information technology. We develop decision-making procedures for determining the optimal driver attendance time, optimal departure times, and optimal routing policies under time-varying traffic flows based on a Markov decision process formulation. With a numerical study carried out on an urban road network in Southeast Michigan, we demonstrate significant advantages when using this information in terms of total cost savings and vehicle usage reduction while satisfying or improving service levels for just-in-time delivery.
