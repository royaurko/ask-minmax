Complexity of vehicle routing and scheduling problems J. K. Lenstra 1 and A. H. G. Rinnooy Kan 2 Article first published online: 11 OCT 2006 DOI: 10.1002/net.3230110211 Copyright © 1981 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company Volume 11 , Issue 2 , pages 221–227 , Summer 1981 The complexity of a class of vehicle routing and scheduling problems is investigated. We review known NP-hardness results and compile the results on the worst-case performance of approximation algorithms. Some directions for future research are suggested. The presentation is based on two discussion sessions during the Workshop to Investigate Future Directions in Routing and Scheduling of Vehicles and Crews, held at the University of Maryland at College Park, June 4–6, 1979.
