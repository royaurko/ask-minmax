Volume 43 of the series Operations Research/Computer Science Interfaces pp 73-102 The Period Vehicle Routing Problem and its Extensions Peter M. Francis Affiliated with The University of Chicago GSB   Email author   , Karen R. Smilowitz Affiliated with Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences, Northwestern University , Michal Tzur Affiliated with Department of Industrial Engineering, Tel Aviv University This chapter presents an overview of the Period Vehicle Routing Problem, a generalization of the classic vehicle routing problem in which driver routes are constructed over a period of time. We survey the evolution of the PVRP and present a synopsis of modeling and solution methods, including classical heuristics, metaheuristics, and mathematical programming based methods. We review three important variants of the problem: the PVRP with Time Windows, the Multi-Depot PVRP, and the PVRP with Service Choice. We present case studies and highlight related implementation issues, including metrics that quantify the operational complexity of implementing periodic delivery routes. Finally, we discuss potential directions for future work in the area. Key words Vehicle routing periodic distribution problems
