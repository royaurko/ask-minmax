Advanced planning concepts, such as dynamic assignment of dismantlers to logistic service providers, are analyzed using a simulation model. Based on this model, we periodically solve a vehicle routing problem to gain insight into the long-term performance of the system. The vehicle routing problem considered is a multi-depot pickup and delivery problem with alternative delivery locations. A special characteristic of the problem is the limited vehicle capacity of two containers. We solve this problem with a heuristic based on route generation and set partitioning.
