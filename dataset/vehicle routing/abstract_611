In the orienteering problem, start and end points are specified along with other locations which have associated scores. Given a fixed amount of time, the goal is to determine a path from the start point to the end point through a subset of locations in order to maximize the total path score. In this paper, a fast and extremely effective heuristic is presented and tested on 67 problems taken from the literature and 40 new test problems. The computational results are presented in detail.
