In this paper we introduce a robust optimization approach to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with demand uncertainty. This approach yields routes that minimize transportation costs while satisfying all demands in a given bounded uncertainty set. We show that for the Miller–Tucker–Zemlin formulation of the VRP and specific uncertainty sets, solving for the robust solution is no more difficult than solving a single deterministic VRP. Our computational results on benchmark instances and on families of clustered instances show that the robust solution can protect from unmet demand while incurring a small additional cost over deterministic optimal routes. This is most pronounced for clustered instances under moderate uncertainty, where remaining vehicle capacity is used to protect against variations within each cluster at a small additional cost. We compare the robust optimization model with classic stochastic VRP models for this problem to illustrate the differences and similarities between them. We also observe that the robust solution amounts to a clever management of the remaining vehicle capacity compared to uniformly and non-uniformly distributing this slack over the vehicles.
