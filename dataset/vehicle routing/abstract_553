In this paper, a parallel clustering technique and route construction heuristic have been developed for the vehicle routing problem (VRP) with split deliveries and pickups. An MILP formulation for determining the exact solution to the problem has also been included. It has been shown through extensive experimentation that the algorithm proposed in this paper statistically produces better results than the only heuristic existing for this class of problems in literature. We also form a basis of comparison between this class of problems and the VRP with simultaneous deliveries and pickups. We note that while heuristics for simultaneous deliveries and pickups cannot be applied in situations where customers' delivery or pickup demands exceed the vehicle capacity, heuristics allowing split deliveries and pickups can, in fact, be applied in every situation, even producing superior results under the combined objective of minimization of the fixed charge and mileage associated with vehicle routes. A guideline as to which heuristic could be used under what parametric conditions and objective functions, has also been provided.
