This paper investigates vehicle-routing problems in which the travel times are random variables, and deliveries are made subject to soft time-window constraints. In particular, we model the travel time using a shifted gamma distribution. Penalties are incurred for deviations from the customers' time windows—early or late—and are developed using a fixed cost, a linear cost penalty, and / or a quadratic loss penalty. Alternatively, specifying a given probability of meeting the time-window constraints is considered. A tabu-search metaheuristic is developed, and computational results on test problems from the literature are reported. stochastic vehicle routing, metaheuristics, time-window constraints
