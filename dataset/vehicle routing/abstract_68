  The problem of vehicle routing when demand at the nodes is uncertain is considered. The quantities to be picked up at the nodes are assumed to be only approximately known. A network with one depot from which vehicles depart and to which they return after completing their service is considered. The paper develops a model to design vehicle routing when demand at the nodes is uncertain. The model is based on the heuristic “sweeping” algorithm, the rules of fuzzy arithmetic and fuzzy logic.
