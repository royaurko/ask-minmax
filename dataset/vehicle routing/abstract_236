The split delivery vehicle routing problem is concerned with serving the demand of a set of customers with a fleet of capacitated vehicles at minimum cost. Contrary to what is assumed in the classical vehicle routing problem, a customer can be served by more than one vehicle, if convenient. We present a solution approach that integrates heuristic search with optimization by using an integer program to explore promising parts of the search space identified by a tabu search heuristic. Computational results show that the method improves the solution of the tabu search in all but one instance of a large test set.
