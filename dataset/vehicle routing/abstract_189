Vehicle routing problem is concerned with finding efficient routes, beginning and ending at a central depot, for a fleet of vehicles to serve a number of customers with demands for some commodity. This paper considers the vehicle routing problem in which the travel times are assumed to be fuzzy variables. A fuzzy optimization model is designed for fuzzy vehicle routing problem with time window. Moreover, fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm are integrated to design a hybrid intelligent algorithm to solve the fuzzy vehicle routing model. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the algorithm. Keywords Vehicle routing problem ; Fuzzy travel time ; Fuzzy simulation ; Genetic algorithm 1. Introduction In recent years, many service suppliers and distributors recognized the importance of designing efficient distribution strategies to improve the level of customer’s service and reduce transportation costs. In a typical distribution system, vehicles provide delivery, customer pick-up, or repair and maintenance services to customers that are geographically dispersed in a given area. In many applications (the distribution of beer, gas online and pharmaceuticals, or the pick-up and delivery of students by school buses just to name a few), a common objective is to find a set of routes for the vehicles which satisfies a variety of constraint and so as to minimize the total fleet operating cost. The problem of minimizing total cost has traditionally been called vehicle routing problem (VRP). In a word, VRP is concern with finding efficient routes, beginning and ending at a central depot, for a fleet of vehicles to serve a number of customers with demands for some commodity. See Fig. 1 . Fig. 1.  A vehicle routing graph. Due to its wide application and economic importance, VRP has been extensively studied. This problem was first introduced by Dantzig and Ramser [4] , and was developed by Clarke and Wright [3] . Stochastic vehicle routing problems (SVRP) arise whenever some elements of the problem are random. Common examples are stochastic demands and stochastic travel times. Sometimes, the set of customers to be visited is not known with certainty. In such a case, each customer has a probability of being presented. To our knowledge, Tillman [31] was the first to propose an algorithm for the SVRP, in the case where there were several depots, and the algorithm proposed by Tillman was based on Clarke and Wright. A second major article is due to Stewart and Golden [28] . It contained extensions and generalizations of previous results of Golden and Yee [15] . A chance constrained programming model (CCP) and two expected value models (EVM) were presented. After that, many researchers, such as Dror and Trudeau [5] , Bodin et al. [2] , Warters [32] , studied various types of SVRP. In the study by Laporte et al. [19] , the depot location was also a decision variable. This article considers more general demand distributions, exact branch and cut algorithms were presented for the CCP and EVM models. And then we refer to the survey article of Dror et al. [6] which describes a variety of operating and service policies, properties and models for the SVRP. From then on, Bastian and Rinnooy Kan [1] , Dror et al. [7]  and  [8] , Gendreau et al. [14] , Laporte [20] , Teodorović and Pavković [29] gave many models and algorithms for SVRP. Solomon [27] , Ichoua et al. [16] , Fleischmann et al. [11] deal with VRPTW with time-varying travel times. More generally, Liu and Lai [23] presented several stochastic programming models for SVRP, which based on the results of Liu [22] , Liu and Iwamura [21] , and integrated stochastic simulation and GA to produce a hybrid intelligent algorithm for solving them. Actually, In some new systems, it is hard to describe the parameters of the problem as random variables because there are not enough data to analyze. For instance, in our problem, the travel time from one customer to another is often not precise enough, especially for the urban traffic. For example, based on experience, it can be “between 35 and 40 min”, “around 2 h”, etc. Generally, we can use fuzzy variables to deal with these uncertain parameters, which is first presented by Teodorović and Pavković [30] in VRP, and Lai et al. [18] modelled VRP by fuzzy programming with possibility measure. In this paper we will consider vehicle routing problem with time window in assumption that the travel time cannot be known precisely, but can be regarded as fuzzy variables. Then we will give a CCP model of FVRPTW based on Liu [24] , and also build a hybrid intelligent algorithm integrating fuzzy simulation and GA to deal with the model. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 , we give some basic concepts on fuzzy variables. In Section 3 , we introduce vehicle routing problem with fuzzy travel time, and present a CCP model for solving these problems, where we will firstly measure fuzzy events with credibility. Then we integrate fuzzy simulation and GA to design a hybrid intelligent algorithm to solve this model in Section 4 . In Section 5 , we will give a numerical experiment to reveal the effectiveness of the hybrid intelligent algorithm. 2. Fuzzy variable An ordinary set is normally defined as a collection of elements. Each single element can either belong or not belong to the set. Such a set can be described in different ways: one can either list the elements that belong to the set; describe the set analytically by a sequence of equalities and inequalities; or define the member elements by using the characteristic function, in which 1 indicates membership and 0 nonmembership. However, in many cases, the membership is not clear. For example, “young man”, “reputable”, “similar”, “satisfactory”, “large number”, “about 100 m”. They are not tractable by the classical set theory or probability theory. In order to deal with them, Zadeh [33] firstly introduced the concept of fuzzy set. And then it has been well developed and applied in a wide variety of real problems. As a fuzzy set of real numbers, the term fuzzy variable was first introduced by Kaufmann [17] , then it appeared in Zadeh [34]  and  [35] and Nahmias [26] . Possibility theory was proposed by Zadeh [35] , and developed by many researchers such as Dubois and Prade [9]  and  [10] .
