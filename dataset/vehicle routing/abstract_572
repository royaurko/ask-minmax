A heuristic approach based on a hybrid operation of reactive tabu search (RTS) and adaptive memory programming (AMP) is proposed to solve the vehicle routing problem with backhauls (VRPB). The RTS is used with an escape mechanism which manipulates different neighbourhood schemes in a sophisticated way in order to get a continuously balanced intensification and diversification during the search process. The adaptive memory strategy takes the search back to the unexplored regions of the search space by maintaining a set of elite solutions and using them strategically with the RTS. The AMP feature brings an extra robustness to the search process that resulted in early convergence when tested on most of the VRPB instances. We compare our algorithm against the best methods in the literature and report new best solutions for several benchmark problems.
