Tables: A New Parallel Tour Construction Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (1995) @TECHREPORT{Antes95anew,     author = {Jürgen Antes and Ulrich Derigs},     title = {A New Parallel Tour Construction Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows},     institution = {},     year = {1995} } In this paper we present a new algorithm for the single depot vehicle routing problem with uniform vehicle capacity and single time windows per customer (VRPTW ). The procedure is based on classical insertion principles but introduces the concept of negotiation between customers and tours leading to an algorithmic scheme which constructs and improves several tours simultaneously. The structure of the entire procedure is modular with the several modules playing different roles with respect to the general objectives of the problem ffl minimizing the number of vehicles and/or ffl minimizing operating cost. The single modules and the whole algorithmic flow are controlled through several parameters by which the logic and the intensity of the different operators can be varied and thus the quality of the output can be influenced. We report computational results showing that our procedure is a flexible and effective means for solving the VRPTW. 1 Essentially, every vehicle routing problem ... ...arch among an exploding number of feasible configurations, but simply the construction of a feasible schedule.

Such heuristically motivated decision rules have been used successfully in construction heuristics for solving the traveling salesman problem (cf. =-=[3]-=-) and were adequately adapted by Solomon [8] to the more complex situation in VRPTW.
