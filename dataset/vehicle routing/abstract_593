This study intends to apply ant colony optimization algorithm for vehicle routing problem with time window. Fuzzy sets theory is employed to transform time variables into fuzzy variables and then search the shortest vehicle route. The evaluation results showed that setting service level between 70% and 90% has the better result. Besides, the analysis of route and the interval of time window have great impact on the result of route planning.
