This paper describes two route-construction heuristics that generate initial solutions quickly. These heuristics are based on the saving-insertion and saving-assignment procedures, respectively. The initial solutions are then improved by a reactive tabu search meta-heuristic. The reactive concept is used in a new way to trigger the switch between different neighbourhood structures for the intensification and diversification phases of the search. Special data structures are also used to manage efficiently the search of the neighbourhood space. Computational results are reported for a number of benchmarks. The results show that the proposed meta-heuristic is robust and competitive to the best approaches in the literature. Copyright Â© 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
