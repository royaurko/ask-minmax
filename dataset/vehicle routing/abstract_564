The word ‘‘robust’’ stresses the effort of controlling the worst-case complexity of the pricing subproblem, keeping it pseudo-polynomial. Besides summarizing older research on the topic, some promising new lines of investigation are also presented, specially the development of new families of cuts over large extended formulations. Computational experiments over benchmark instances from ACVRP, COVRP, CVRP and HFVRP variants are provided. Key words Column generation cutting plane algorithms extended formulations branch-and-bound
