Volume 1520 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 417-431 Date: 11 June 1999 Using Constraint Programming and Local Search Methods to Solve Vehicle Routing Problems Paul Shaw Affiliated with ILOG S.A. We use a local search method we term Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS) to solve vehicle routing problems. LNS is analogous to the shuffing technique of job-shop scheduling, and so meshes well with constraint programming technology. LNS explores a large neighbourhood of the current solution by selecting a number of “related” customer visits to remove from the set of planned routes, and re-inserting these visits using a constraint-based tree search. Unlike similar methods, we use Limited Discrepancy Search during the tree search to re-insert visits. We analyse the performance of our method on benchmark problems. We demonstrate that results produced are competitive with Operations Research meta-heuristic methods, indicating that constraint-based technology is directly applicable to vehicle routing problems This work was carried out while the author was working in the Department of Computer Science, University of Strathclyde, as part of the APES research group.
