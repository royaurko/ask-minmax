  Two Route first-cluster second vehicle routing algorithms are contrasted in the first section of the paper. Next, the ‘large’ number of feasible solutions to a multiple travelling salesman problem is established given that each salesman can visit any number of customers in a stated range. An approximate expression is given for the ‘small’ fraction of this solution space searched by a route first-cluster second vehicle routing heuristic. Nevertheless, this heuristic is seen to be a very efficient means of searching its solution space. Route first-cluster second methods for vehicle routing Omega, 11 (4) (1983), pp. 403–408 2.
