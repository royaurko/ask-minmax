We propose a genetic algorithm based heuristic for solving the problem of open loop distribution network planning. The goal of power distribution system planning is to satisfy the growth and changing system load demand during the planning period and within operational constraints, with minimal costs. Although the algorithm was developed for specific real world problems, the method is quite general and can be encountered in many planning contexts that can be correlated with the well known Capacitated Vehicle Routing problem (CVRP). For the CVRP problem, the influences of the respective control parameters were examined. Also the issues regarding the usage of different selection parameters are examined, in order to observe their impact on the optimization procedure. The results of experiments testing the solution procedures are reported
