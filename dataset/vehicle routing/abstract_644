To this end, the paper presents a compact review of vehicle routing literature and an overview of the results of a recent study of commercial vehicle routing software systems with respect to the problem features these systems are able to handle and the solution methods the systems use for automatic generation of vehicle routes. In this way, existing application and research gaps are identified. Keywords Rich vehicle routing Commercial vehicle routing software Heuristics
