Abstract: Consider the following generalization of the well-known travelling salesman problem. The prize-collecting travelling salesman problem (pc-tsp) is to find a minimum-cost route for the vehicle, visiting each city at most once and collecting a total prize not less than a given goal g. Such a problem arises in several routing and scheduling applications and belongs to the class of np-hard problems. In this paper, we introduce several mathematical models of the problem and point out its main substructures. Additive bounding procedures are then designed yielding sequences of increasing lower bound on the optimum value of the problem. Extensive computational results on randomly generated test problems are reported, comparing the performance of the proposed bounding procedures. A branch and bound algorithm for the optimal solution of pc-tsp is finally described and computationally analyzed. (Author/TRRL)
