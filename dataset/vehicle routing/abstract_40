The vehicle routing problem with time windows models many realistic applications in the context of distribution systems. In this paper, a parallel tabu search heuristic for solving this problem is developed and implemented on a network of workstations. Empirically, it is shown that parallelization of the original sequential algorithm does not reduce solution quality, for the same amount of computations, while providing substantial speed-ups in practice. Such speed-ups could be exploited to quickly produce high quality solutions when the time available for computing a solution is reduced, or to increase service quality by allowing the acceptance of new requests much later, as in transportation on demand systems.
