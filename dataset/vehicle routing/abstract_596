Reviews on Vehicle Routing Problem and Its Solution Methods SUN Li-jun,HU Xiang-pei,WANG Zheng(Institute of Systems Engineering,Dalian University of Technology,Dalian 116023,China)   Focusing on vehicle routing problems(VRP),this paper summarizes and reviews domestic and abroad researches on models and algorithms in this field comprehensively.First of all,we divide vehicle routing problems into different kinds according to values of their common attributes.Then,after introducing the graph model and mathematical model of the problem,we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the two kinds of models.Besides that,we review four kinds of(algorithms) for VRP,exact algorithm,constructive heuristic algorithm,improving heuristic algorithm and meta-heuristic(algorithm.)On the basis of analyzing the past achievements and shortages,next research directions in the field are discussed.
