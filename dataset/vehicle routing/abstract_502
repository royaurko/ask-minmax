Password: A Lagrangian based exact solution algorithm for the vehicle routing problem (VRP), defined on an undirected graph, is introduced in this paper. Lower bounds are obtained by allowing exponentially many inequalities as candidates to Lagrangian dualization. Three different families of strong valid inequalities (each one with exponentially many elements) are used within VRP formulations. For each of them, separation procedures are proposed for points that define incidence vectors of K -trees. Violated inequalities identified in this way are then dualized in a relax and cut framework. Upper bounds are generated through a Lagrangian Clarke and Wright heuristic. A variable fixation test based on (approximating) linear programming reduced costs, is also implemented. Computational results are presented for the proposed algorithm. Keywords Integer programming ; Exact solution algorithm ; Vehicle routing problem ; Relax and cut 1. Introduction Vehicle routing problem (VRP) is the generic name given to a large class of problems involving the distribution of goods, services, information or personnel. A particularly important special case of the general problem is that of minimizing the total distance (time) required by a fleet of vehicles to satisfy delivery orders placed by customers . Vehicles are stationed at a central depot (to which they should return at the end of the operation) and have identical, fixed capacities . The number K ⩾1 of vehicles to be used, i.e. routes to be formed, is assumed to be part of the problem input data. Routing decisions involve the allocation of customers to vehicles (without exceeding vehicle capacities) and determining the sequence in which customers allocated to a vehicle should be visited. This problem is known in the literature as the VRP [13]  and  [14] , the truck dispatching problem [11] , [18]  and  [30] , the vehicle scheduling problem [15]  and  [24] , and the Classical VRP [31] . In this paper, the problem is denoted VRP. The VRP is clearly -hard. Indeed it generalizes the traveling salesman problem (TSP) (see the book by Lawler et al. [35] or the survey by Jünger et al. [27] , for instance) in that a TSP can be viewed as a VRP with a single vehicle of infinite capacity. The VRP has been the object of considerable research for the past four decades. For surveys on exact and approximate VRP algorithms the reader is referred to Christofides [10] , Laporte and Norbert [33] , Fisher [23] and Laporte and Osman [34] . A highly relevant reference is the recent book by Toth and Vigo [45] which covers both exact and heuristic methods developed for the VRP and some of its main variants. An annotated bibliography on the subject is found in Laporte [31] . VRP models and exact solution algorithms based on these models are studied in Beasley et al. [7] . Some recent exact solution algorithms are Achuthan et al. [1] , Augerat et al. [3]  and  [4] , Hadjiconstantinou et al. [28] , Mingozzi et al. [41] , Miller [40] and Ralphs et al. [42] . This paper builds upon results in Fisher [21] , where a Lagrangian relaxation exact solution algorithm for the VRP is proposed. Lower bounds in [21] are obtained from K -tree relaxations of the problem. A K -tree (see [22] for details) can be thought of as a generalization of the concept of a 1-tree (see Held and Karp [25] ). The algorithm of Fisher [21] is extended here in a number of ways. In particular, our algorithm, contrary to that of Fisher, is a relax and cut one (as in Lucena [37]  and  [38] ). Therefore, an exponential number of inequalities are true candidates for Lagrangian dualization. Additionally, our algorithm relies on a stronger formulation of the problem (since additional families of valid inequalities are brought into the formulation used in [21] ). Finally, tests for fixing variables, based on lower bounds for Linear Programming reduced costs are proposed and successfully used here. Feasible VRP solutions are generated through a Lagrangian Clarke and Wright [15] heuristic. This heuristic uses dual (Lagrangian) information as an input to generating primal solutions. Combining the ingredients mentioned above allows for sharper lower bounds than the ones in [21] to be obtained. A more detailed description of most of what is presented here can be found in Martinhon [39] . This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 some basic results from [21]  and  [22] are presented. These are fundamental for the development of our algorithm. In particular, a VRP formulation is presented and its associated K -tree relaxation is described. Section 3 gives a general outline of a relax and cut algorithm. Throughout 4 , 5  and  6 , a point x in a multidimensional real-valued space, is assumed to be the incidence vector of a K -tree. In Section 4 a procedure for the identification of generalized subtour elimination constraints (GSECs) violated by x is proposed. In Section 5 the same applies in relation with comb inequalities. In Section 6 , yet again, the same applies in relation with multistar inequalities. Variable fixation is treated in Section 7 . In Section 8 a Lagrangian VRP heuristic is described. In Section 9 lower and upper bounds are embedded into an implicit enumeration procedure. Computational experiments are presented in Section 10 . Finally the paper is closed in Section 11 with some conclusions and suggestions for future work. 2. VRP formulation and minimum K -tree relaxation Let G =( V 0 , E ) be an undirected graph with a set of vertices V 0 ={0,1,…, n } and a set of edges E . For simplicity, assume G to be a complete graph and let V = V 0 ⧹{0}. Following [21] , vertices in V are associated with customers while vertex 0 is associated with the depot. Edges in E may be referred to either as e ∈ E or else as e =( i , j ), i < j , for i , j ∈ I ; whatever is more convenient.
