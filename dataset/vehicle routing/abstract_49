This paper surveys the research on the metaheuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). The VRPTW can be described as the problem of designing least cost routes from one depot to a set of geographically scattered points. The routes must be designed in such a way that each point is visited only once by exactly one vehicle within a given time interval; all routes start and end at the depot, and the total demands of all points on one particular route must not exceed the capacity of the vehicle. Metaheuristics are general solution procedures that explore the solution space to identify good solutions and often embed some of the standard route construction and improvement heuristics described in the first part of this article. In addition to describing basic features of each method, experimental results for Solomonâ€™s benchmark test problems are presented and analyzed.
