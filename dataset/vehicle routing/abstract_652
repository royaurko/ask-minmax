Review of Vehicle Routing Problem in Supply Chain ZHU Chong-jun, LIU Min, WU Cheng (Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China)   Vehicle routing problem is an important content in supply chain field. This paper gives a review of achievements of vehicle routing problem. Several category methods are introduced, and quite a few common side conditions are summarized. Backgrounds and detail application fields for deterministic VRP, stochastic VRP and fuzzy VRP are introduced, different model methods for them are discussed, diverse algorithm ideas for them are summarized, and the advantage and limitation for these algorithm are discussed, furthermore, their applicable cope are also presented. On the other hand, brief summarization for home study is also presented. The further efforts are presented, while demand for application of supply chain is combined. 【Key Words】： certain vehicle routing problem uncertain rehicle routing problem supply chain 【Fund】： 国家自然科学基金资助项目 ( 6 0 0 0 40 10 );; 国家科技部中英科技合作基金 【CateGory Index】： F252.1 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 10 Hits 1 ZHENG Li-qun,WANG De-dong,LI Da-wei (Faculty of Science,Anshan University of Science and Technology,Anshan 114044,China); Survey on stochastic vehicle routing problem [J];Journal of Anshan University of Science and Technology;2005-Z1 2 WANG De-dong,ZHENG Pi-e(School of Management,Tianjin University,Tianjin 300072,China); Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Demands in Supply Chain [J];Industrial Engineering Journal;2006-05 3 LIU Yun-zhang, XUAN Hui-yu(Management School of Xi'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an 710049,China); Summarizing Research on Models and Algorithms for Vehicle Routing Problem [J];Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management;2005-01 4 XU Jun-jie (School of Economics and Management,Anqing Teachers College,Anqing 246133,China); Solving Vehicle Routing Problem by Micro—canonical Annealing Algorithm [J];Journal of Anqing Teachers College(Natural Science Edition);2009-02 5 MA Lei(College of Computer Science,SCUFN,Wuhan 430074,China); Research Algorithm on Vehicle Rrouting Problem(VRP) [J];Computer Knowledge and Technology;2009-19 6 Lin Xiaoyu Li Jinming Ji Shouwen; Improvement and Realization of Clarke Wright Algorithm of Vehicle Routing Problem [J];Computer and Communications;2004-06 7 Song Houbing et al; Improved Genetic Algorithm of Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window Constraints [J];Computer and Communications;2003-04 8 SONG Hou-bing , CAI Yuan-li (School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China); Hybrid genetic algorithm of vehicle routing with time windows [J];Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering;2003-04 9 ZHAO Zhen-hua, WANG Jie, LOU Chun-yuan (Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China); Research on Models and Algorithms for Vehicle Routing Problem in Distribution [J];Logistics Sci-Tech;2007-01 10 Ji Shouwen Lin Xiaoyu(Modern Logistics Research Center of Shenzhen Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518057) Li Keqiang Miao Lixin(Automobile Department, Tsinghua University,Beijing 100084); THE DESIGN FOR WEB SHOPING AND DISTRIBUTING MANAGEMENT BASED ON J2EE [J];Computer Applications and Software;2004-03 China Proceedings of conference Full-text Database 5 Hits 1 ; 应用于立体仓库的自动导引车(AGV)的运行优化设计 [A];[C];2004 2 ; 应用于拣选操作的自动化立体仓库作业优化调度 [A];[C];2004 3 ; 应用于立体仓库的自动导引车(AGV)的运行优化设计 [A];[C];2004 4 ; 应用于拣选操作的自动化立体仓库作业优化调度 [A];[C];2004 5 Jing Fan~(1,2) Guo-chun Tang~3 1 School of Science,East China University of Science and Technology,Shanghai 200237 2 School of Science,Shanghai Second Polytechnic University,Shanghai,201209 3 Institute of Management Engineering,Shanghai Second Polytechnic University,Shanghai,201209; Tabu Search for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pick-up and Delivery Service [A];[C];2008 【Citations】 1 Zhang Tao,Wang Mengguang (School of Information Science and Engineering,Northeastern University, Shenyang 110006,China); Solving the VRP by a Hybrid Algorithm of Genetic Algorithm and 3 opt Algorithm [J];JOURNAL OF NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY(NATURAL SCIENCE);1999-03 【Co-citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 10 Hits 1 XIE Ru-he,LIU Ting,QIU Zhu-qiang (Institute for Logistics Engineering, Central South University,Changsha 410075,China); VRP Related to Reverse Logistics Based on Residual Loading Capacity [J];Systems Engineering;2004-10 2 SONG Jian hai,LIU Shi xin,WANG Meng guang,TANG Li xin (School of Information Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110004,China); Modeling and Algorithms of Finished Product Delivery Plan in Steel Plants [J];Journal of Northeastern University(Natural Science);2001-06 3 DENG Lian-bo~1,SHI Feng~1,MO Hui-hui~2 (1.Traffic and Transportation Engineering School,Central South University,Changsha,410075,China;2.Chinese Communication and Transportation Association,Beijing 100053,China); Multi-generation compete genetic algorithms for logistics distribution vehicle routing problem [J];;2005-05 4 ZHANG Qian1, GAO Liqun1, HU Xiangpei2(1.
