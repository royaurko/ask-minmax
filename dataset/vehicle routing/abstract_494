The basic input data for any vehicle routing models are travel time, distances, and cost between nodes in the network. Information on these basic data is not always accurate, since many factors affect the condition of vehicle travel. Travel time on an urban road network may be considered ‘fuzzy’, since its estimate is often subjective and it can be controlled by the driver to some extent. Developing vehicle routes, hence, must incorporate the fuzziness of travel time in the network. In this paper, a vehicle routing model which treats travel times between nodes as a ‘fuzzy’ number is introduced. Assuming that all the travel times between nodes are fuzzy numbers, the proposed model follows the principles of the classical Clarke-Wright algorithm to develop a set of vehicle routes. The examples presented show that the route pattern of each vehicle varies considerably with the degree of fuzziness of travel time. This suggests that depending upon the dispatcher's level of confidence about the travel time, different vehicle route patterns can be developed.
