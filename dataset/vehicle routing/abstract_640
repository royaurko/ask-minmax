Improved MMAS for vehicle routing problem with time window WAN Xu , LIN Jian-liang , YANG Xiao-wei (Dep. of Applied Mathematics,South China Univ. of Tech.,Guangzhou 510640,China)   Max-Min Ant System (MMAS) reduced the possibility of ant system being dropped into the local trap via Max-Min strategy. By improved Max-Min pheromone strategy and the way of updating pheromone,an improved algorithm was proposed by based on the traditional algorithm which gave initial results fast. The proposed algorithm was applied to the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window(VRPTW). The experiment results indicates that the new algorithm is effective. 【Key Words】： ant system vehicle routing problem time window 【CateGory Index】： O224 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format.
