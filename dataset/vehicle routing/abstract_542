Over the years, the central focus of vehicle routing problems has been the construction of minimum cost delivery routes, i.e. the creation of spatial utilities without considering temporal aspects. In many public service organizations, however, the minimum cost route without time windows can lead to poor customer service due to its ignorance of delivery deadlines. On the other hand, the most timely route may excessively lengthen vehicle travel distance, thereby increasing the total distribution cost. Consequently, the public distribution system calls for a new vehicle routing model that both considers time windows and analyzes the tradeoff between time and cost. This paper develops such a model and verifies its practical usefulness by applying it to the case of a public library distribution system in the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area.
