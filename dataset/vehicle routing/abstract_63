This paper considers a version of the stochastic vehicle routing problem where customers are present at locations with some probabilities and have random demands. A tabu search heuristic is developed for this problem. Comparisons with known optimal solutions on problems whose sizes vary from 6 to 46 customers indicate that the heuristic produces an optimal solution in 89.45% of cases, with an average deviation of 0.38% from optimality.
