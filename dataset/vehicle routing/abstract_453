  The Vehicle Routing Problem is a well known, and hard, combinatorial problem, whose polyhedral structure has deserved little attention. In this paper we consider the particular case in which all the demands are equal (since in the general case the associated polytope may be empty). From a known formulation of the problem we obtain the dimension of the corresponding polytope and we study the facetial properties of every inequality in it.
