  Corrected Miller–Tucker–Zemlin type subtour elimination constraints for the capacitated vehicle routing problem are presented. Keywords Subtour elimination constraints ; Vehicle routing problem The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is defined on a graph G =( V , A ), where V ={ v 1 ,…, v n } is a vertex set, v 1 is a depot, and the remaining vertices are customers; the set is an arc set. With each vertex v i ∈ V ⧹{ v 1 } is associated a positive integer demand q i and with each arc ( v i , v j ) is associated a travel cost c ij . The CVRP consists of determining a set of m vehicle routes satisfying the following conditions: (i) each route starts and ends at the depot, (ii) each customer belongs to exactly one route, (iii) the total demand of each route does not exceed the vehicle capacity Q , (iv) the total cost of all routes is minimized. There exists an extensive literature on the CVRP. For a recent overview, see [1] . There are several ways to formulate the CVRP. In the following formulation, x ij is a binary variable equal to 1 if and only if arc ( v i , v j ) belongs to the solution, and an integer u i variable is associated with each customer v i . Variables x ij and x ji are only defined if q i + q j ⩽ Q . The CVRP is then: In this formulation, constraints , ,  and  are degree constraints whereas constraints (6) ensure that the solution contains no subtours disconnected from the depot. Together with (7) , they also present the formation of vehicle routes containing the depot but having a total demand exceeding Q . Constraints  and  , proposed by Kulkarni and Bhave [2] , extend the Miller–Tucker–Zemlin [3] subtour elimination constraints for the traveling salesman problem . Note that the right-hand side of (6) is mistakenly written as Q − q i in [2] , which forbids a number of feasible solutions. For example, consider the legal route ( v 1 , v i , v j , v 1 ) where Q =3, q i =2 and q j =1. Constraints (7) imply u i ⩾2, and constraints (6) with a right-hand side of Q − q i imply u j ⩾ u i +2⩾4, which violates (7) . are valid inequalities for the CVRP. Proof. If x ij =0, then the left-hand side attains a maximum of Q − q j when u i takes its maximal value Q and u j takes its minimal value q j . To show that (6) is valid when x ij =1, consider any legal vehicle route ( v i 1 = v 1 , v i 2 ,…, v i r = v 1 ) induced by the x ij variables equal to 1. Then setting u i 1 =0 and means that  and  hold for these values of , and x i r ,1 =1. □ Desrochers and Laporte [4] also use constraints (6) but their lifting of these constraints is incorrectly written as equation ( 10 ) which can also be shown to eliminate some feasible solutions by using the above example. This can be corrected as follows. Introducing an extra term α ji x ji in (6) yields equation ( 12 ) We seek the largest value of α ji so that (12) is valid. If x ji =0, then α ji can take any value. If x ji =1, then x ij =0 and we obtain since constraints (6) for x ji =1 imply u j − u i ⩽− q i . □
