A competitive neural network model is used to improve the initialization phase of a parallel route construction heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The neural network identifies seed customers that are nicely distributed over the whole geographic area. In particular, the network converges towards the centroids of clusters of customers, when such clusters are present. Computational results on a standard set of problems are reported, both with a simple initialization methodology and the neural network initialization.
