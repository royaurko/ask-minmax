  We propose a heuristic for a class of vehicle routing problems (VRPs) with minmax objective. These include the Capacitated VRP, the Capacitated VRP with multiple use of vehicles, and the m -Travelling Salesman Problem with multiple use of vehicles. A tabu search based adaptive memory procedure of instances indicate that the method produces very good solutions within reasonable computing times.
