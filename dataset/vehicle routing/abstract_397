An enhanced cooperative-search mechanism creates new information and guides global search. On the basis of attribute patterns shared by the solutions exchanged among search threads, the mechanism sends information to independent metaheuristics about promising and unpromising solution space patterns. This process results in better coordination among methods and the possibility of guiding the diversification and intensification of the global search. Experimental results on an extended set of benchmark problem sets for the vehicle routing problem with time windows illustrate and confirm the proposed methodology's benefits.<p>This article is part of a special issue on transportation and logistics.</p> INDEX TERMS parallel computation, parallel cooperative search, vehicle routing problem with time windows Alexandre Le Bouthillier, Teodor G.
