The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is the problem in which a set of identical vehicles located at a central depot is to be optimally routed to supply customers with known demands subject to vehicle capacity constraints. In this paper, we describe a new integer programming formulation for the CVRP based on a two-commodity network flow approach. We present a lower bound derived from the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the new formulation which is improved by adding valid inequalities in a cutting-plane fashion. Moreover, we present a comparison between the new lower bound and lower bounds derived from the LP relaxations of different CVRP formulations proposed in the literature. A new branch-and-cut algorithm for the optimal solution of the CVRP is described. Computational results are reported for a set of test problems derived from the literature and for new randomly generated problems.
