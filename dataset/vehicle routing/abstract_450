Â  This paper deals with a routing problem variant which considers customers to simultaneously require delivery and pick-up services. The examined problem is referred to as the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pick-ups and Deliveries (VRPSPD). VRPSPD is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, practical large-scale instances of which cannot be solved by exact solution methodologies within acceptable computational times. Our interest was therefore focused on metaheuristic solution approaches. In specific, we introduce an Adaptive Memory (AM) algorithmic framework which collects and combines promising solution features to generate high-quality solutions. The proposed strategy employs an innovative memory mechanism to systematically maximize the amount of routing information extracted from the AM, in order to drive the search towards diverse regions of the solution space. Our metaheuristic development was tested on numerous VRPSPD instances involving from 50 to 400 customers. It proved to be rather effective and efficient, as it produced high-quality solutions, requiring limited computational effort. Furthermore, it managed to produce several new best solutions.

Introduction This article examines a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) which considers customers to require both delivery and pick-up services. The examined problem is known as VRP with Simultaneous Pick-ups and Deliveries (VRPSPD), and arises in practical transportation operations that involve bi-directional flow of products.
