Competitive learning in neural networks involving cooperation and categorization is discussed. Extended vehicle routing problems in the Euclidean space are also discussed. A fixed number of vehicles with a shared depot make subtours around precategorized cities and collect demands. The minimal tour length and even loaded demands are conflicting requirements for the optimization. This situation does not appear in a simple traveling salesman problem. The self-organization method gives qualified approximate solutions without computational backtracks. Experiments were made on the USA532 set. All computations can be carried out by a conventional workstation
