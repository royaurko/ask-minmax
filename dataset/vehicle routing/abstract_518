The open vehicle routing problem (VRP) is an immediate variant of the standard vehicle routing problem where the vehicle need not return to the depot after servicing its last customer. In this paper, we present results on an implementation of the attribute-based hill climber heuristic to the open VRP. The attribute-based hill climber heuristic is a parameter-free variant of the tabu search principle and has shown to be highly effective for the standard vehicle routing problem. distribution, vehicle routing, heuristics
