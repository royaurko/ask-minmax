This paper describes a novel tabu search heuristic for the multi-trip vehicle routing and scheduling problem (MTVRSP). The method was developed to tackle real distribution problems, taking into account most of the constraints that appear in practice. In the MTVRSP, besides the constraints that are common to the basic vehicle routing problem, the following ones are present: during each day a vehicle can make more than one trip; the customers impose delivery time windows; the vehicles have different capacities considered in terms of both volume and weight; the access to some customers is restricted to some vehicles; the drivers' schedules must respect the maximum legal driving time per day and the legal time breaks; the unloading times are considered.
