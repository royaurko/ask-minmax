New Heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem Jean-François Cordeau , Michel Gendreau , Alain Hertz , Gilbert Laporte , Jean-Sylvain Sormany This chapter reviews some of the best metaheuristics proposed in recent years for the Vehicle Routing Problem. These are based on local search, on population search and on learning mechanisms. Comparative computational results are provided on a set of 34 benchmark instances.
