The aim of this study is to describe a new stochastic search meta-heuristic algorithm for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), termed as the List Based Threshold Accepting (LBTA) algorithm. The main advantage of this algorithm over the majority of other meta-heuristics is that it produces quite satisfactory solutions in reasonable amount of time by tuning only one parameter of the algorithm. This property makes this algorithm a reliable and a practical tool for every decision support system designed for solving real life vehicle routing problems.
