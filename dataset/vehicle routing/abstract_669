An Improved Genetic Algorithm for Vehicle Routing Problem with Soft Time Windows BIN Song,FU Zhuo (School of Traffic & Transportation,Central South University,Changsha 410075,China)   Vehicle routing problem with soft time windows(VRPSTW) is a variation of vehicle routing problem(VRP), which is a typical NP-hard problem. In this paper, we describe an improved GA for the VRPSTW, in which a new coding method, the adaptive mechanism of crossover and mutation, and penalty function are introduced. Computational results on a set of benchmark problems show that the procedure is efficient. 【Key Words】： Vehicle Routing Problem Soft Time Windows Genetic Algorithm 【Fund】： 国家自然科学基金资助项目 (70 0 710 0 3) 【CateGory Index】： F224 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats;
