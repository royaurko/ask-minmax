Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic vehicle routing and scheduling model that incorporates the variation of travel times. Dynamic traffic simulation was used to update the distribution of travel times. The model was applied to a test road network. Results indicated that the total cost decreased by implementing the probabilistic vehicle routing and scheduling model with variable travel times compared with that of the forecast model.
