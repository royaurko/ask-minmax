We consider the vehicle routing and scheduling problem with time window constraints. Analytical results concerning the behavior of approximation methods for this problem class are derived through worst-case analysis. For a variety of heuristics, it is shown that their worst-case behavior on n customer problems is at least order of n for minimizing the number of vehicles used, the total distance traveled, and the total schedule time.
