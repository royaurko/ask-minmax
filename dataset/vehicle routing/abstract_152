The vehicle routing problem with backhauls involves the delivery and pickup of goods at different customer locations. In many practical situations, however, the same customer may require both a delivery of goods from the distribution centre and a pickup of recycled items simultaneously. In this paper, an insertion-based procedure to generate good initial solutions and a heuristic based on the record-to-record travel, tabu lists, and route improvement procedures are proposed to resolve the vehicle routing problems with simultaneous deliveries and pickups. Computational characteristics of the insertion-based procedure and the hybrid heuristic are evaluated through computational experiments. Computational results show that the insertion-based procedure obtained better solutions than those found in the literature. Computational experiments also show that the proposed hybrid heuristic is able to reduce the gap between initial solutions and optimal solutions effectively and is capable of obtaining optimal solutions very efficiently for small-sized problems.
