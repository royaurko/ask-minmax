The proposed algorithm for the solution of the Vehicle Routing Problem, the Honey Bees Mating Optimization (HBMOVRP), combines a Honey Bees Mating Optimization (HBMO) algorithm and the Multiple Phase Neighbor- hood Search — Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (MPNS-GRASP) algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested on a set of benchmark instances and produced very satisfactory results. In all instances, the average quality is less than 0.20%. More specifically, in the fourteen classic instances proposed by Christofides, the average quality is 0.029%. The algorithm is ranked in the 2th place among the most known and effective algorithms in the literature and in the first place among all Nature Inspired methods that have ever been used for this set of instances.
