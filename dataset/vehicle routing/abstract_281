Password: We present a Tabu search algorithm for the vehicle routing problem (VRP) under capacity and distance restrictions. The neighborhood search is based on compound moves generated by a node-ejection chain process. During the course of the algorithm, two types of neighborhood structures are used and crossing infeasible solutions is allowed. Then, a parallel version of the algorithm which exploits the moves' characteristics is described. Parallel processing is used to explore the solution space more extensively and to accelerate the search process. Tests are carried out on a SUNSparc workstation and the parallel algorithm uses a network of four of these machines. Numerical tests indicate that the sequential version of the algorithm is highly competitive with the best existing heuristics and that the parallel algorithm outperforms all of these algorithms.

Introduction The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a generic name given to a whole class of problems in which a set of routes for a fleet of vehicles based at one or several depots must be determined for a number of geographically dispersed cities or customers , subject to side constraints. The VRP arises naturally as a central problem in the fields of transportation, distribution and logistics (see [28] for a bibliography on VRPs). The classical VRP is defined as follows. Let G =( V , A ) be a graph where V ={ v 0 , v 1 ,…, v n } is a vertex set, and A ={( v i , v j )∣ v i , v j ∈ V ; i ≠ j } is an arc set. Consider a depot to be located at v 0 and let V ′ = V ⧹{ v 0 } be used as the set of n cities. A matrix C of non-negative costs or distances c ij is defined on A . When c ij = c ji for all ( v i , v j )∈ A the problem is said to be symmetric and it is then common to replace A with the edge set E ={( v i , v j )∣ v i , v j ∈ V ; i < j }. We assume that m identical vehicles each with capacity Q are used and their number is a decision variable. Vehicles make collections or deliveries but not both. With each vertex v i in V ′ is associated a quantity q i of some goods to be delivered by a vehicle. The VRP thus consists of determining a set of m vehicle routes of minimal total cost, starting and ending at a depot, such that every vertex in V ′ is visited exactly once by one vehicle and the total quantity assigned to each route does not exceed the capacity of the vehicle which services the route. We will also consider an extension of this problem in which a service time δ i is required by a vehicle to unload the quantity q i at v i . It is required that the total duration of any vehicle route (travel plus service times) may not surpass a given bound D , so, in this context the cost c ij is taken to be the travel times between the cities. The VRP defined above is NP-hard and the aim of this paper is to describe a new Tabu search algorithm for the general VRP defined above. Tabu search is a metaheuristic proposed by Glover [13] . The method is generically presented in Glover [14]  and  [15] and recent developments may be found in Glover [18]  and  [19] . For a comprehensive description of the method and applications see [22] . A number of algorithms based on this approach have already been applied to the VRP, each one using different types of moves leading from one solution to another (see [11] , [30] , [33] , [35] , [37]  and  [38] ). An important contribution of our method is the use of embedded neighborhood structures based on the idea of ejection chains. Embedded neighborhoods may be conceived as the outcome of compressing a sequence of moves into a single compound move, and ejection chain procedures give a useful way to build these neighborhoods. For a detailed explanation of the ejection chain methods we refer to [16] , [17] , [20]  and  [31] . A number of methods based on this prespective have recently been proposed for various combinatorial problems (see [2] , [8] , [23] , [26] , [27] , [32]  and  [33] ). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we briefly summarize the ideas underlying ejection chains and we describe their application to the VRP. Section 3 describes the sequential version of the proposed algorithm and a parallel approach is described in Section 4 . Then, the computational results and a comparative analysis of the algorithms are presented in Section 5 . Finally, Section 6 contains a summary and concluding remarks. 2. New neighborhood structures for vehicle routes A fundamental aspect in the performance of all Tabu search applications is to identify an effective neighborhood for defining moves from one solution to another. Recent Tabu search applications to the VRP attempt to increase their performance using compound moves. The basic moves consist of a simple insertion or exchange of vertices/arcs on the graph of the problem and compound moves are usually obtained by combinations of these moves. Osman [30] uses a combination of insertion moves and exchange moves, vertex shifts from one route to another and exchange vertices between routes based on 2-opt process. Another type of compound move has been used by Gendreau et al. [11] . Here, a compound move consists of a simple insertion followed by only one 3-opt exchange or 4-opt exchange. Rochat and Taillard [35] combine partial route constructions with node insertions to obtain complete neighboring solutions. Finally, Rego [33] considers a subpath ejection chain method based on the identification of a reference structure to generate compound moves. In this paper we will use another type of ejection chain process based on the ejection of nodes. 2.1. Node-ejection chains for the VRP In this section, we describe how a solution can be modified to generate another neighboring solution using a node-ejection chain method which can be equally applied to symmetric and asymmetric problems. Ejection chain procedures have been defined by Glover [17]  and  [20] for the TSP and provide an interesting way to generate neighborhoods of compound moves. Here, we give an illustration of how these procedures can also be used for the VRP. We assume that a partial graph S =( V , X ) associated with a solution is given. To maintain Glover's perspective, a node-ejection chain may be viewed as a series of levels, each consisting of three vertices which appear consecutively in a route. We will use the following notation. For any vertex v , in a given orientation of a route, let be its predecessor and v̄ be its successor. Consequently, we denote by ( ) a triplet representing two consecutive arcs ( ) and ( ).
