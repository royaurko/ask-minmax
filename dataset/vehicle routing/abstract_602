It is a computationally very hard problem. Whereas classical OR models are static and deterministic, these assumptions are rarely warranted in an industrial setting. Lately, there has been an increased focus on dynamic and stochastic vehicle routing in the research community. However, very few generic routing tools based on stochastic or dynamic models are available. We illustrate the need for dynamics and stochastic models in industrial routing, describe the Dynamic and Stochastic VRP, and how we have extended a generic VRP solver to cope with dynamics and uncertainty Keywords Logistics Transportation Vehicle Routing Dynamic Stochastic Optimization
