We investigate the implementation of edge-exchange improvement methods for the vehicle routing problem with time windows with minimization of route duration as the objective. The presence of time windows as well as the chosen objective cause verification of the feasibility and profitability of a single edge-exchange to require an amount of computing time that is linear in the number of vertices. We show how this effort can, on the average, be reduced to a constant. INFORMS Journal on Computing , ISSN 1091-9856, was published as ORSA Journal on Computing from 1989 to 1995 under ISSN 0899-1499.
