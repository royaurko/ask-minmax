  In the team orienteering problem, start and end points are specified along with other locations which have associated scores. Given a fixed amount of time for each of the M members of the team, the goal is to determine M paths from the start point to the end point through a subset of locations in order to maximize the total score. In this paper, a fast and effective heuristic is presented and tested on 353 problems ranging in size from 21 to 102 points. The computational results are presented in detail.
