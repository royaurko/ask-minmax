  Two of the key aspects of solid waste management are the design of efficient collection routes and the formulation of appropriate policies and decisions criteria for the efficient and economic collection of municipal refuse. In this paper, the design and implementation of a computerized system for the routing of solid waste collection vehicles and the experiences in implementing this system for the Town of Oyster Bay, New York are presented. An interesting aspect of this study is that the study was initiated by both the Sanitation Union in the Town of Oyster Bay and the Management of the Town of Oyster Bay. References 1. L.J. Ricchio, A.
