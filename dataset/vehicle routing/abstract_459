  We address a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) in which the demand of a node can be split on several vehicles celled split services by assuming heterogeneous fixed fleet. The objective is to minimize the fleet cost and total distance traveled. The fleet cost is dependent on the number of vehicles used and the total unused capacity. In most practical cases, especially in urban transportation, several vehicles transiting on a demand point occurs. Thus, the split services can aid to minimize the number of used vehicles by maximizing the capacity utilization. This paper presents a mix-integer linear model of a CVRP with split services and heterogeneous fleet. This model is then solved by using a simulated annealing (SA) method. Our analysis suggests that the proposed model enables users to establish routes to serve all given customers using the minimum number of vehicles and maximum capacity. Our proposed method can also find very good solutions in a reasonable amount of time. To illustrate these solutions further, a number of test problems in small and large sizes are solved and computational results are reported in the paper.

Introduction A classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) [1] consists of finding the least cost routes for a set of homogeneous vehicles located at a depot to geographically scattered customers. The service may involve delivering goods, picking up and delivering students or picking up packages for express mail delivery, and the like. In this paper, we present an extended type of a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) [2] , in which the demand points can be served by more than one vehicle as shown in Fig. 1 . In the classical VRP, each node must be served by only one vehicle. However, in many practical cases, it is possible that the customers at each node served by several vehicles that transit from that node. On the other words, a service can divided between several vehicles that we name split service . In previous researches on the VRP, this matter is not considered. We show that the split service can lead to a more little fleet cost and travel time. The split service often occurs in urban transportation systems when several vehicles can transit from a demand point or the number of customers in a node may be more than the capacity of vehicles with the maximum fleet capacity. In this case, the maximum capacity utilization can be achieved by minimizing the number of used vehicles (see the example presented in Section 2.6 ). Thus, the objective is to minimize the number of vehicles used and maximize the fleet capacity utilization as well as minimize the total distance traveled by the fleet. The last objective is a common criterion in the VRP implicating customer satisfaction. Fig. 1.  We consider a heterogeneous fixed fleet (HVRP) with a fixed number of vehicles for each type (class), with various capacities and variable costs. The HVRP is an extension of the VRP in which the number of vehicles of each type is unlimited, so each route is performed by the cheapest vehicle type with respect to capacity constraints [3] . The HVRP is much harder to solve than the VRP because the model must make a decision using a limited fleet. Taillard [4] developed a heuristic column generation method based on the adaptive memory procedure (AMP) for solving the HVRP. Also, Tarantilis [5] developed a meta-heuristic method based on the threshold accepting for the HVRP. Our research focuses on the CVRP with heterogeneous fleet and split service (CHVRPSS). The CVRP and HVRP are the subject of many researches [6] , [7] , [8]  and  [9] . The VRP belongs to the category of NP-hard problems [10] . Thus, it is faced with the use of heuristic algorithms such as backtracking adaptive threshold accepting (BATA) meta-heuristic methods [10] , minimum K-trees [11] , local search algorithms [12] , adaptive memory (AM) heuristic [13] , column generation methods [14] , constraint programming [15] and location-based heuristics [2] . Also meta-heuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA) [16]  and  [17] , hybrid simulated annealing (HAS) [18] based on nearest neighborhood, genetic algorithms (GAs) [17]  and  [19] , tabu search (TS) [20] , [21]  and  [22] , and ant system [23]  and  [24] are widely used for solving the CVRP. In the literature, the CHVRPSS is treated as a customer with demand d (i.e., customers with the same size demand at the same location). This perspective is not suitable for the mathematical model because of increasing complexity and hardness. We present a linear mix-integer model of the CHVRPSS that is more complex than the classical CVRP. This model is then solved by simulated annealing. The proposed model is verified optimally using the branch-and-bound (B&B) method in the Lingo 8.0 software, and finally the computational results are reported. This paper is organized as follows: the problem formulation is described in Section 2 . The proposed heuristic algorithm for solving the developed model is presented in Section 3. Then it is followed by computational results and the conclusion in 4  and  5 respectively.
