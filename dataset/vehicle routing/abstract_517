The Clarke-Wright algorithm is a heuristic algorithm which has been implemented frequently and successfully to solve large-scale vehicle routing problems. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the accuracy of the Clarke-Wright procedure in its sequential form. We present examples of pathological behavior and suggest algorithm modifications to help overcome these problems.
