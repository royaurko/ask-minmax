We present a new and effective metaheuristic algorithm, active guided evolution strategies, for the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The algorithm combines the strengths of the well-known guided local search and evolution strategies metaheuristics into an iterative two-stage procedure. More precisely, guided local search is used to regulate a composite local search in the first stage and the neighborhood of the evolution strategies algorithm in the second stage. The vehicle routing problem with time windows is a classical problem in operations research, where the objective is to design least cost routes for a fleet of identical capacitated vehicles to service geographically scattered customers within pre-specified time windows. The presented algorithm is specifically designed for large-scale problems. The computational experiments were carried out on an extended set of 302 benchmark problems. The results demonstrate that the suggested method is highly competitive, providing the best-known solutions to 86% of all test instances within reasonable computing times. The power of the algorithm is confirmed by the results obtained on 23 capacitated vehicle routing problems from the literature.

Introduction Vehicle routing problems are important and well-known combinatorial optimization problems occurring in many transport logistics and distribution systems of considerable economic significance. The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) has recently received a lot of attention in the literature. This is mainly because of the wide applicability of time window constraints in real-world cases. In the VRPTW, the objective is to find a set of minimum-cost vehicle routes which start at a central depot, service a set of customers with known demands, and return to the depot. Each customer must be serviced once by a vehicle, and the total demands of the customers serviced by the vehicle must not exceed the capacity of the vehicle. Moreover, each customer must be serviced within a specified time window. If a vehicle arrives at a customer earlier than the lower bound of the customer's time window, the vehicle must wait until the service is possible. In some applications, service after the upper bound of the time window is also allowed, but a penalty is set for the service (e.g. Koskosidis et al. [1] and Taillard et al. [2] ). The depot has also a time window, and all the vehicles must return by the closing time of the depot. The objective is to minimize the number of tours or routes, and then for the same number of routes, to minimize the total traveled distance. VRPTW is an NP-hard problem, and although optimal solutions can be obtained using exact methods, the computation time required to solve the VRPTW to optimality is prohibitive (Desrochers et al. [3] ). Since heuristic methods often produce near optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of computational time, most of the research has focused to the design of heuristics and metaheuristics. For surveys on exact, heuristic and metaheuristic methods, we refer to Desrosiers et al. [4] , Cordeau et al. [5] , and Bräysy and Gendreau [6]  and  [7] , respectively. The heuristic methods for the VRPTW can be divided into construction heuristics, improvement heuristics (local searches) and metaheuristics. Construction heuristics build a feasible solution by inserting unrouted customers iteratively into current partial routes according to some specific criteria, such as minimum additional distance or maximum savings, until the route's scarce resources (e.g. capacity) are depleted. Sequential route construction heuristics build routes one at a time whereas parallel construction heuristics create several routes simultaneously. For examples of construction heuristics, see insertion heuristics of Solomon [8] , Potvin and Rousseau [9] , Bramel and Simchi-Levi [10] , Mester [11] , Ioannou et al. [12] and Dullaert and Bräysy [13] . Improvement heuristics modify the current solution iteratively by performing local searches for better neighboring solutions. Generally, a neighborhood comprises the set of solutions that can be reached from the incumbent solution by replacing a set of k arcs or customer nodes. For the most successful applications of improvement heuristics for the VRPTW, see Thompson and Psaraftis [14] , Potvin and Rousseau [15] , Russell [16] , Shaw [17] , Caseau and Laburthe [18] , Schrimpf et al. [19] , Cordone and Wolfler Calvo [20] and Bräysy et al. [21] . Metaheuristics are general solution procedures that explore the solution space to identify good solutions and they often embed some of the standard route construction and improvement heuristics. In contrast to classical approaches, metaheuristics allow deteriorating and even infeasible intermediate solutions in the course of the search process to escape local minima. So far tabu searches [22] , genetic algorithms [23] and evolution strategies [24] have shown the best performance for vehicle routing problems. For example Rochat and Taillard [25] , Taillard et al. [2] , Chiang and Russell [26] , Schulze and Fahle [27] and Cordeau et al. [28] have applied tabu search, while Berger et al. [29] and Jung and Moon [30] report good results with genetic algorithms. An agent-based methodology drawing on both genetic algorithms and tabu search is introduced in Le Bouthillier and Crainic [31] . Recently Homberger and Gehring [32] , [33]  and  [34] and Mester [11]  and  [35] have obtained excellent results with evolution strategies algorithms. For other recent efficient metaheuristics for the VRPTW, see for example Kontoravdis and Bard [36] who describe a two-phase greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) based on a penalty guided random insertion procedure and standard improvement heuristics. Liu and Shen [37] propose a two-stage metaheuristic based on a new neighborhood structure focusing on the relationship between routes and nodes. Guided local search [38] is applied in Kilby et al. [39] , and Gambardella et al. [40] introduces an ant colony system [41] consisting of two separate ant colonies with different objectives, guiding well-known construction and improvement heuristics. Bräysy [42] and Rousseau et al. [43] experiment with variable neighborhood search [44] , and simulated annealing [45] is applied in Chiang and Russell [46] , Li and Lim [47] and Bent and Van Hentenryck [48] . Genetic algorithms, tabu search and simulated annealing are hybridized in Thangiah et al. [49] , and Ibaraki et al. [50] describes different multi-start local search strategies. For further details on the metaheuristics for the VRPTW, we refer to Bräysy and Gendreau [7] . According to Bräysy and Gendreau [7] the previously proposed heuristics for the VRPTW show significant variability in performance, and fail to convincingly provide a single robust and successful solution technique. Several recent studies of real-life VRPTW applications indicate a significant potential for improving existing optimization techniques (Hasle [51] ). Given the practical importance of the VRPTW, further research on this topic is therefore justified. The main contribution of this paper is development of a more robust and efficient solution technique for large scale VRPTW. The novelty of the new metaheuristic concept consists of combining the strengths of guided local search (GLS) [38] and evolution strategies (ES) [24] into an iterative two-stage procedure. More precisely, GLS is used to regulate a composite local search in the first stage, and the objective function and the neighborhood of the modified ES local search algorithm of Mester [11]  and  [35] in the second stage. We call the suggested new metaheuristic active guided evolution strategies (AGES). To our best knowledge this kind of method has not been used before. Our experiments on 302 large-scale VRPTW benchmarks and on 23 capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) instances from the literature demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is fast, cost-effective and highly competitive. It found the best-known solutions to 86% of the well-known large-scale VRPTW benchmark problems and to 21 out of the 23 tested CVRP instances.
