Genetic Algorithm Design and Application on Vehicle Routing Problem Tang Kun (Glorious Sun School of Business and Management, Dong Hua University, Shanghai, 200051)   In logistic management research, vehicle routing problem has gained a lot of attention. However, as a NP hard problem, vehicle routing problem is hard to draw a satisfactory conclusion by using traditional optimal algorithm. This paper uses a improved crossover and genetic operator, designs a nature number based genetic algorithm, uses them to solve this problem and has a good result. 【Key Words】： logistic management system genetic algorithm vehicle routing problem 【CateGory Index】： O221 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 10 Hits 1 PENG Guo-yong①,WU Sheng①②(①Spatial Information Research Center,Fujian Province;Key Laboratory of Spatial Data Mining and Information Sharing,Ministry of Education,Fuzhou University,Fuzhou 350003,China;②LREIS,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research,CAS,Beijing 100101,China); Genetic algorithm and simulated annealing of vehicle routing with time window [J];Science of Surveying and Mapping;2007-06 2 Han Bingyuan,Xiao Shengling(College of Traffic and Transportation Engineering,Northeast Forestry University,Harbin 150040,P.R.China); Optimization of Immediate Distribution Route for Perishable Goods Based on Genetic Algorithms [J];Journal of Northeast Forestry University;2007-02 3 HUA xin(Base Departmen Active University of Air Force, Changchun 130022); The optimation of the routing problem based on genetic algorithm [J];Computer Programming Skills & Maintenance;2009-S1 4 PAN Li-jun,DONG Xiong-bao(School of Management,Guilin University of Electronic Technology,Guilin 541004,China); Application of improved immune clone algorithm in VRP [J];Journal of Guilin University of Electronic Technology;2006-06 5 CHENG Yong,WANG Jun-feng,Li Shi-qi(School of Mechanical Science and Engineering,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Wuhan 430074,China); Hybrid Fast Ant Algorithm for Vehicle Routing Problem [J];Industrial Engineering and Management;2007-04 6 LI Lin,LIU Shi-xin,TANG Jia-fu(Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry,Ministry of Education,Northeastern University,Shenyang 110004,China); Model and Algorithm for Distribution/Delivery of Goods on Order in B2C E-commerce [J];Journal of Northeastern University(Natural Science);2009-11 7 LI Ning,CHEN Ding-fang,ZU Qiao-hong(Research Inst.of Intelligent Manuf.and Control,Wuhan Univ.of Tech.,Wuhan 430081,China;); On the Optimization of the Information System of Logistic Distribution with the 1stOpt Software [J];Journal of Hubei University of Technology;2009-02 8 JI Da-qin (Naval Arms Command Academy,Guangzhou 510430,China); An Improved Genetic Algorithm on the Problem of Naval Fleet Antiaircraft Firepower Distribution [J];Journal of Naval Aeronautical Engineering Institute;2007-03 9 FAN Jun - tao, XIE Hong - bing, CHEN En - peng (Economic Management College, Harbin Univ.
