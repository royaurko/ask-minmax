Password: The vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pick-up and delivery (VRP_SPD) is a variant of the classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) where clients require simultaneous pick-up and delivery service. Deliveries are supplied from a single depot at the beginning of the vehicle's service, while pick-up loads are taken to the same depot at the conclusion of the service. One important characteristic of this problem is that a vehicle's load in any given route is a mix of pick-up and delivery loads. In this paper we develop a tabu search algorithm to solve VRP_SPD. This algorithm uses three types of movements to obtain inter-route adjacent solutions: the relocation, interchange and crossover movements. A 2 - opt procedure is used to obtain alternative intra-route solutions. Four types of neighbourhoods were implemented, three of them defined by the use of each of the single inter-route movements and the fourth by using a combination of these movements. Two different search strategies were implemented for selecting the next movement: first admissible movement and best admissible movement. Intensification and diversification of the search were achieved through frequency penalization. Computational results are reported for a set of 87 test problems with between 50 and 400 clients.

Introduction One variation of the classical vehicle routing problem considers clients that require simultaneous pick-up and delivery service. We call this problem the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (VRP_SPD). VRP_SPD was introduced in 1989 by Min [1] . It is often encountered in practice, for example in the soft drink industry, where empty bottles must be returned, and in the delivery to grocery stores, where reusable pallets/containers are used for the transportation of merchandise. In other practical applications within the context of distribution systems, customers may have both a delivery and a pick-up demand. These customers may not accept to be serviced separately for the delivery and pick-up they require, because a handling effort is necessary for both activities and this effort may be considerably reduced by a simultaneous operation. Reverse logistics is another area in which the planning of vehicle routes takes the form of a VRP_SPD problem, as companies become interested in gaining control over the whole lifecycle of their products. For example, in some countries legislation forces companies to take responsibility for their products during lifetime, especially when environmental issues are involved (as in the disposal of laser printers’ cartridges). Returned goods are another example where the definition of vehicle routes may take the form of a VRP_SDP problem. In Brazil VRP_SPD was studied within the context of transportation of personnel between the continent and oil exploration and production platforms located in the Campos Basin in the state of Rio de Janeiro. In this case, the transportation is carried out by helicopters based on the continent. The problem consists of determining routes for a fleet of helicopters that transports people from the continent to the platforms and back, seeking to minimize transportation costs. A heuristic algorithm was developed to solve this problem, see Galvão and Guimarães [2] . There are few references to VRP_SPD in the literature. There exist, however, abundant references related to routing problems in which clients require pick-up and delivery service, but not simultaneously. There are theoretical relationships between these problems and VRP_SPD and it is possible to transform VRP_SPD into other routing problems with pick-up and delivery service. For example, it is easy to show that any particular instance of VRP_SPD can be transformed into a problem with non-simultaneous pick-ups and deliveries, since the latter problem is a particular case of VRP_SPD in which only one of the demands (pick-up or delivery) is different from zero in each node. It is also possible to show that any instance of VRP_SPD can be transformed into an instance of the m-Dial-a-Ride Problem . These transformations are illustrated at the end of Section 2 (see Fig. 2 ), after several problems involving pick-up and delivery service are defined and briefly reviewed. This paper is organized in the following manner. In Section 2 , we present a brief literature review of vehicle routing problems that involve pick-up and delivery service. In Section 3 , two integer programming formulations of VRP_SPD are described (corresponding to problems without and with maximum distance constraints, respectively), and lower bounds are defined for these formulations. The tabu search meta-heuristic is developed in Section 4 . This is followed by computational results ( Section 5 ) and conclusions ( Section 6 ). 2. Brief literature review of VRP_SPD and related problems After VRP_SPD was defined by Min [1] there was, to the best of our knowledge, a gap of more than 10 years without any work on this problem being published. A number of researchers re-visited the problem in recent years. Dethloff [3] studied the problem from the point of view of reverse logistics. He proposed a mathematical formulation for VRP_SPD and developed insertion-based heuristics that use four different criteria to solve the problem. Salhi and Nagy [4] proposed four insertion heuristics, based on the methodology proposed by Golden et al. [5] and Casco et al. [6] . These same authors recently proposed a local search heuristic that considers solutions with a certain degree of infeasibility (see Salhi and Nagy [7] ). Two local search heuristics were developed by Tang and Galvão [8] . The first of these is an adaptation of a tour partitioning heuristic defined by Beasley [9] and the second uses the sweep algorithm of Gillet and Miller [10] , both originally developed for the classical VRP. The procedures developed by Tang and Galvão [8] solve traveling salesman problems with simultaneous pick-up and delivery (TSP_SPD) for each individual route, by adapting methods originally proposed for the non-simultaneous case. Tang and Galvão also proposed an alternative mathematical formulation for VRP_SPD. An exact algorithm for VRP_SPD with time windows was developed by Angelelli and Mansini [11] , using a branch-and-price algorithm. The Express Delivery Problem (EDP, see Tang et al. [12] ) is another problem with pick-up and delivery demand in each node. In this case, however, the fulfilment of demand is not simultaneous, being composed of two phases: a pick-up phase and a delivery phase. It is worth noting that the pick-up and delivery routes do not necessarily coincide. Several other routing problems with pick-ups and deliveries are reported in the literature. In these each client requires pick-up or delivery service, but not pick-up and delivery simultaneously. Savelsbergh and Sol [13] define a general routing problem in this category which they call the General Pick-up and Delivery Problem . This problem was proposed such that most pick-up and delivery problems can be defined as particular cases of their formulation. A classical problem addressed in the literature, the Dial-a-Ride Problem , consists of picking up clients in pre-specified locations and transporting them to known delivery points, using vehicles based in a given depot. Each pick-up location is associated with a delivery location, forming pairs of locations, with the pick-up activity preceding the delivery activity. This problem may be subject to additional constraints such as maximum travel times for clients and/or time windows. The following objectives are minimized in a hierarchical fashion: (i) number of vehicles; (ii) total distance traveled; (iii) the difference between effective pick-up and delivery times and those desired by clients. Exact dynamic programming algorithms were developed by Psaraftis [14]  and  [15] to solve static and dynamic versions of the Dial-a-Ride Problem , as well as a variant with time windows. A more efficient algorithm for the time windows variant was proposed by Desrosiers et al. [16] . Heuristic methods for this problem were developed by Psaraftis [17] , Sexton and Bodin [18]  and  [19] and Sexton and Choi [20] . More recently Van der Bruggen et al. [21] proposed a simulated annealing algorithm and Madsen et al. [22] used a parallel insertion heuristic for the variant with time windows. The extension of this problem for several vehicles, the m-Dial-a-Ride problem , was studied by Roy et al. [23]  and  [24] , Jaw et al. [25] , Desrosiers et al. [26] and Ioachim et al. [27] , among others. Dumas et al. [28] proposed an exact procedure to solve the multi-vehicle problem with time windows. Another routing problem in this category is the problem with backhauls (VRP_B); in this problem all deliveries must be concluded before any pick-ups can be made. In the case of a single vehicle the Traveling Salesman Problem with Backhauls is defined; Gendreau et al. [29] developed several two-phase heuristics for this problem. The extension for several vehicles was studied by Deif and Bodin [30] , Golden et al. [5] and Casco et al. [6] . Toth and Vigo [31] and Mingozzi and Giorgi [32] developed mathematical formulations and exact methods to solve this problem. Gélinas et al. [33] studied the problem with time windows and Duhamel et al. [34] developed a tabu search for solving it.
