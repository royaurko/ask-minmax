  The vehicle routing problem with backhaul (VRPB) is an extension of the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). In VRPB, there are linehaul as well as backhaul customers. The number of vehicles is considered to be fixed and deliveries for linehaul customers must be made before any pickups from backhaul customers. The objective is to design routes for the vehicles so that the total distance traveled is minimized. We use multi-ant colony system (MACS) to solve VRPB which is a combinatorial optimization problem. Ant colony system (ACS) is an algorithmic approach inspired by foraging behavior of real ants. Artificial ants are used to construct a solution by using pheromone information from previously generated solutions. The proposed MACS algorithm uses a new construction rule as well as two multi-route local search schemes. An extensive numerical experiment is performed on benchmark problems available in the literature. Keywords Metaheuristic ; Ant colony ; Vehicle routing 1. Introduction In vehicle routing problem with backhaul (VRPB), there are two groups of customers: linehaul or delivery customers and backhaul or pickup customers. A linehaul customer requires a given quantity of product to be delivered while a backhaul customer requires a given quantity of product to be picked up. The problem can be defined using graph theory as follows. Consider a complete undirected graph G=(N,A) G = ( N , A ) , where N={0}∪L∪B N = { 0 } ∪ L ∪ B is a set of l+b+1 l + b + 1 vertices and subsets L={1,…,l} L = { 1 , … , l } and B={l+1,l+2,…,l+b} B = { l + 1 , l + 2 , … , l + b } correspond to the linehaul and backhaul customers, respectively. Set A={(i,j),i,j∈N} A = { ( i , j ) , i , j ∈ N } is a set of arcs. Associated with arc ( i , j   ), there is a nonnegative cost c(i,j) c ( i , j ) and associated with vertex i   there is a non-negative quantity d i d i . Vertex 0 represents the depot (with fictitious demand 0), where v identical vehicles, each with capacity Q   are located. It is assumed that the number of available vehicles v⩾max(v L ,v B ) v ⩾ max ( v L , v B ) , where v L v L and v B v B are the minimum number of vehicles needed to serve all linehaul and all backhaul customers, separately. The values of v L v L and v B v B can be calculated by solving the bin packing problems (BPP) associated with the subsets of linehaul and backhaul customers. Although BPP is an NP-hard problem in strong sense, it can be solved optimally within reasonable CPU time even when the problem involves hundreds of items/customers (see Silvano and Paolo, 1990 ). In this paper, we do not deal with mixed service, i.e., we assume that each vehicle is unloaded first by satisfying the demands of linehaul customers and later it is loaded by collecting the loads from backhaul customers. Also a route consisting entirely of backhaul customers is not allowed ( Toth and Vigo, 2001 ). The objective is to design a set of minimum cost routes so that the total load of linehaul or the total load of backhaul customers does not exceed the vehicle capacity on each route. VRPB is an NP-hard problem in a strong sense since by setting B=ϕ B = ϕ , the problem becomes CVRP, which is known to be an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we use the abbreviations CVRP and VRP interchangeably.
