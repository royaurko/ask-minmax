Volume 43 of the series Operations Research/Computer Science Interfaces pp 171-198 Parallel Solution Methods for Vehicle Routing Problems Teodor Gabriel Crainic Affiliated with Department of Management and Technology ESG, Université du Québec à Montréal CIRRELT, Université de Montréal   Email author   Parallel solution methods contribute to efficiently address large and complex combinatorial optimization problems, vehicle routing problems in particular. Parallel exact and heuristic methods for VRP variants are increasingly being proposed, and the pace seems to increase in recent years. “New” strategies have been proposed and many of the best known solutions to classical formulations have thus been obtained. This chapter describes and discusses the main strategies used to parallelize exact and metaheuristic solution methods for vehicle routing problems. It also provides an up-to-date survey of contributions to this rapidly evolving field and points to a number of promising research directions. Key words Parallel computation parallelization strategies branch-and-bound metaheuristics vehicle routing problems
