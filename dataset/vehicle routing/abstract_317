The main idea is to combine an Ant System (AS) with a problem specific constructive heuristic, namely the well known Savings algorithm. This difiers from previous approaches, where the subordinate heuristic was the Nearest Neighbor algorithm initially proposed for the TSP. We compare our approach with some other classic, powerful meta-heuristics and showthat our results are competitive.
