However, very few genetic-based approaches exploit implicit knowledge provided by the structure of the intermediate solutions computed during the evolutionary process to explore the solution space. This paper presents a new hybrid genetic algorithm for VRPTW. It investigates the impact of using explicitly domain knowledge and a priori knowledge/characteristics about expected solutions during the recombination and mutation phases of the algorithm. Basic principles borrow from recent hybrid and standard genetic algorithms, and features of well-known heuristics to drive the search process. Designed to support time-constrained reasoning tasks, the procedure is intended to be conceptually simple, easy to implement and allow fast computation of near-optimal solution. A computational experiment has been conducted to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with similar and standard techniques.
