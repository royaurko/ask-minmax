  This paper considers a relaxation of the classical vehicle routing problem (VRP), in which split deliveries are allowed. As the classical VRP, this problem is NP-hard, but nonetheless it seems more difficult to solve exactly. It is first formulated as an integer linear program. Several new classes of valid constraints are derived, and a hierarchy between these is established. A constraint relaxation branch and bound algorithm for the problem is then described. Computational results indicate that by using an appropriate combination of constraints, the gap between the lower and upper bounds at the root of the search tree can be reduced considerably. These results also confirm the quality of a previously published heuristic for this problem.
