The objective of the problem is to serve a number of customers within predefined time windows at minimum cost, without violating the capacity and total trip time constraints for each vehicle. Combinatorial optimization problems of this kind are NP-hard and are best solved by heuristics[6]. Our GA implementation uses intuitive integer string representation and incorporates several new crossover operations and other techniques such as hybrid hill-climbing and adaptive mutation scheme using statistical measures, and achieve good results, especially in clustered datasets. ...ical measures, and achieve good results, especially in clustered datasets.

Instead, many heuristic methods have been proposed to solve VRPTW to near optima. Genetic algorithm, originally developed by Holland=-=[7]-=-, is an adaptive heuristic that simulates the optimization process with the natural evolution of genes in a population of organics.
