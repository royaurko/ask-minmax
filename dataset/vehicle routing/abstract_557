We present an ant colony system hybridized with local search for solving the OVRP (ACS-OVRP). Additionally, a Post-Optimization procedure is incorporated in the proposed algorithm to further improve the best-found solutions. The computational results of ACS-OVRP compared to those of other algorithms are reported, which indicate that the ACS-OVRP is another efficient algorithm for solving the OVRP.
