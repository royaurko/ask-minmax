Research work dealing with the vehicle routing problem has not paid adequate attention to the cases where the demand for services at certain nodes is a random variable. This paper develops an approach to the vehicle routing problem for the case of stochastic demand. The approach is based on the simulated annealing technique. It is illustrated with a numerical example.
