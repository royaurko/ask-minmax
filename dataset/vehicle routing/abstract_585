This paper describes the combination of a well-known tsp heuristic, genius , with a constraint programming model for routing problems. The result, genius-cp , is an efficient heuristic single-vehicle routing algorithm which is generic in the sense that it can solve problems from many different contexts, each with its particular type(s) of constraints. The heuristic quickly constructs high-quality solutions while the constraint model provides great flexibility as to the nature of the problem constraints involved by relieving that heuristic of all constraint satisfaction concerns. We show how those two components are integrated in a clean way with a well-defined, minimal interface. We also describe different routing problems on which this algorithm can be applied and evaluate its performance.
