  The stochastic vehicle routing problem is a problem of growing importance. Introduction of stochastic element in classical routing problems may change the structure of those problems. This property has not been fully recognized in the literature. We present modifications of existing models and introduce more realistic ones. Under certain assumptions, these models turn out to exhibit the structure of the time-dependent traveling salesman problem. Keywords Distribution ; road transportation ; stochastic processes [1] L.D.
