Abstract: Given demands for service at various points in a transportation network over which the vehicles may travel, decisions concerning the spatial configuration of vehicle movements are classified as "routing problems". These problems usually involve the specification of a sequence of locations that a vehicle must visit. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of vehicle routing problems and solution methodologies. For the covering abstract of the conference see IRRD no 283191. (TRRL)
