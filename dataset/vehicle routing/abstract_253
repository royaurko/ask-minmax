Volume 3004 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 11-20 Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem by Using Cellular Genetic Algorithms Enrique Alba Affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University Department of Computer Science, University of Málaga , Bernabé Dorronsoro Affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University Central Computer Services, University of Málaga Cellular Genetic Algorithms (cGAs) are a subclass of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) in which the population diversity and exploration are enhanced thanks to the existence of small overlapped neighborhoods. Such a kind of structured algorithms is specially well suited for complex problems. In this paper we propose the utilization of some cGAs with and without including local search techniques for solving the vehicle routing problem (VRP). A study on the behavior of these algorithms has been performed in terms of the quality of the solutions found, execution time, and number of function evaluations (effort). We have selected the benchmark of Christofides, Mingozzi and Toth for testing the proposed cGAs, and compare them with some other heuristics in the literature. Our conclusions are that cGAs with an added local search operator are able of always locating the optimum of the problem at low times and reasonable effort for the tested instances.
