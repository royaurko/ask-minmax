The purpose of this paper is to propose new heuristics for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Backhauls. In this problem, the aim is to determine a least cost Hamiltonian tour through a set of linehaul and backhaul customers, in such a way that all backhaul customers are visited contiguously after all linehaul customers. Six heuristics, all having a good empirical performance ratio, are described and compared with a lower bound. Computational results indicate that the best of these heuristics yields high quality solutions.
