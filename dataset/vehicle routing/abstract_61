We describe two optimization methods for vehicle routing problems with time windows. These are a K-Tree relaxation with time windows added as side constraints and a Lagrangian decomposition in which variable splitting is used to divide the problem into two subproblemsâ€”a semi-assignment problem and a series of shortest path problems with time windows and capacity constraints. We present optimal solutions to problems with up to 100 customers.
