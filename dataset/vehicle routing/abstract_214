The paper describes a model for the optimal management of periodic deliveries of a given commodity. The goal is to schedule the deliveries according to feasible combinations of delivery days and to determine the scheduling and routing policies of the vehicles in order to minimize over the planning horizon the maximum number of vehicles simultaneously employed, i.e., the fleet size. Heuristic algorithms are proposed and computational experience is reported.
