A problem often considered in operations research and computational physics is the traveling salesman problem, in which a traveling salesperson has to find the shortest closed tour between a certain set of cities. This problem has been extended to more realistic scenarios, e.g., the “real” traveling salesperson has to take rush hours into consideration. We will show how this extended problem is treated with physical optimization algorithms. We will present results for a specific instance of Reinelt’s library TSPLIB95 , in which we define a zone with traffic jams in the afternoon. Received 5 January 2001
