We consider a scheme to derive lower bounds for the time-dependent traveling salesman problem. It involves splitting lower bounds into a number of components and optimizing each of these components. The lower bounds thus derived are shown to be at least as sharp as the ones previously suggested for the problem. We describe a branch-and-bound algorithm based on our lower bounding scheme and computationally test it for an instance of the problem known as the traveling deliveryman problem.
