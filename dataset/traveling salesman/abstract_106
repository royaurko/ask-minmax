In this article, we study the impact of communication when we parallelize a high-performing ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm for the traveling salesman problem using message passing libraries. In particular, we examine synchronous and asynchronous communications on different interconnection topologies. We find that the simplest way of parallelizing the ACO algorithms, based on parallel independent runs, is surprisingly effective; we give some reasons as to why this is the case.
