  In this paper, a new heuristic for the period traveling salesman problem is presented. Our heuristic is fast and simple and has improved upon previous best-known solutions. In addition, we have generated a variety of challenging, new test problems. Our new heuristic is shown to perform well on these new problems. References 1. M.R. Garey, D.S.
