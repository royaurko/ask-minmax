In this paper we present a general genetic algorithm to address a wide variety of sequencing and optimization problems including multiple machine scheduling, resource allocation, and the quadratic assignment problem. When addressing such problems, genetic algorithms typically have difficulty maintaining feasibility from parent to offspring. This is overcome with a robust representation technique called random keys . Computational results are shown for multiple machine scheduling, resource allocation, and quadratic assignment problems.
