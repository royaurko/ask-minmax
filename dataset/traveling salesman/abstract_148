Consider a traveling salesman problem with stochastic travel times. Our objective is to find a tour with maximum probability of completion by a specified time. This paper presents a preference order dynamic program for solving the problem. To facilitate computation, we introduce a branch-and-bound strategy in the solution procedure. Finally, we propose an implicit enumeration algorithm as an alternative approach.
