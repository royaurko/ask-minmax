We introduce a novel combinatorial optimization problem: the one-commodity traveling salesman problem with selective pickup and delivery (1-TSP-SELPD), characterized by the fact that the demand of any delivery customer can be met by a relatively large number of pickup customers. While all delivery spots are to be visited, only profitable pickup locations will be included in the tour so as to minimize its cost. The motivation for 1-TSP-SELPD stems from the carrier-based coverage repair problem in wireless sensor and robot networks, wherein a mobile robot replaces damaged sensors with spare ones. The ant colony optimization (ACO) meta-heuristic elegantly solves this problem within reasonable time and space constraints. Six ACO heuristic functions are put forward and a recently proposed exploration strategy is exploited to accelerate convergence in dense networks. Results gathered from extensive simulations confirm that our ACO-based model outperforms existing competitive approaches.
