Traveling salesman problems with profits (TSPs with profits) are a generalization of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), where it is not necessary to visit all vertices. A profit is associated with each vertex. The overall goal is the simultaneous optimization of the collected profit and the travel costs. These two optimization criteria appear either in the objective function or as a constraint. In this paper, a classification of TSPs with profits is proposed, and the existing literature is surveyed. Different classes of applications, modeling approaches, and exact or heuristic solution techniques are identified and compared. Conclusions emphasize the interest of this class of problems, with respect to applications as well as theoretical results.
