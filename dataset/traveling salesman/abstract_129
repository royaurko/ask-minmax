We consider the problem of finding the minimum number of vehicles required to visit once a set of nodes subject to time window constraints, for a homogeneous fleet of vehicles located at a common depot. This problem can be formulated as a network flow problem with additional time constraints. The paper presents an optimal solution approach using the augmented Lagrangian method. Two Lagrangian relaxations are studied. In the first one, the time constraints are relaxed producing network subproblems which are easy to solve, but the bound obtained is weak. In the second relaxation, constraints requiring that each node be visited are relaxed producing shortest path subproblems with time window constraints and integrality conditions. The bound produced is always excellent. Numerical results for several actual school busing problems with up to 223 nodes are discussed. Comparisons with a set partitioning formulation solved by column generation are given.
