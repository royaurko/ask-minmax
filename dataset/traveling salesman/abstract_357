The proposed linear program is a network flow-based model. Numerical implementation issues and results are discussed. (The exposition and proofs are much more detailed in an edition which I wrote in collaboration with Dr. M.H. Karwan in 2012-2014 . That edition is available at this http URL ) Comments: 10 pages; Published in "WSEAS Transactions on Mathematics." Constraints added to rectify minor oversight in proof of proposition 2 (Theoretical development is same). Hofman's claim of a "counter-example" (arXiv cs/0610125 and cs/0611008 ) is invalid: violates constraints 2.11-2.15 Subjects: Computational Complexity (cs.CC) ; Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) ACM  classes: F.2.2 Cite as: arXiv:cs/0609005 [cs.CC]   (or arXiv:cs/0609005v7 [cs.CC] for this version) Submission history From: Moustapha Diaby [ view email ] [v1] Sat, 2 Sep 2006 09:28:41 GMT (480kb) [v2] Tue, 17 Oct 2006 15:47:19 GMT (250kb) [v3] Sun, 22 Oct 2006 14:01:23 GMT (248kb) [v4] Fri, 10 Nov 2006 09:44:19 GMT (246kb) [v5] Wed, 27 Dec 2006 23:41:13 GMT (467kb) [v6] Sun, 13 May 2007 16:19:40 GMT (549kb) [v7] Thu, 10 Jul 2014 16:56:56 GMT (549kb)
