A strategy for solving the traveling salesman problem is adapted to the problem of finding a biconnected subgraph of a weighted graph whose cost function satisfies the triangle inequality. An approximation algorithm similar to Christofides' algorithm [5] for the traveling salesman problem is shown to possess the same worst-case bound of when applied to the biconnectivity augmentation problem. A tight inequality is derived relating the cost of an optimal traveling salesman tour to the cost of an optimal biconnection.
