Computational results are presented for a parallel branch and bound algorithm that optimally solves the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. The algorithm uses an assignment problem based lower bounding technique, subtour elimination branching rules, and a subtour patching algorithm as an upper bounding procedure. Results are presented for randomly generated problems with sizes ranging from 50 to 3000 cities.
