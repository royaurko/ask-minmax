Berlekamp, Elwyn R. and McEliece, Robert J. and van Tilborg, Henk C. A. (1978) On the inherent intractability of certain coding problems. IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 24 (3). pp. 384-386.

This strongly suggests, but does not rigorously imply, that no algorithm for either of these problems which runs in polynomial time exists.
