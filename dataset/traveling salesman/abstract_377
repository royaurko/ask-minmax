This paper presents a variant of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP) in which the traveling time between each pair of cities is represented by an interval of values (wherein the actual travel time is expected to lie) instead of a fixed (deterministic) value as in the classical ATSP. Here the ATSP (with interval objective) is formulated using the usual interval arithmetic. To solve the interval ATSP (I-ATSP), a genetic algorithm with interval valued fitness function is proposed. For this purpose, the existing revised definition of order relations between interval numbers for the case of pessimistic decision making is used. The proposed algorithm is based on a previously published work and includes some new features of the basic genetic operators. To analyze the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and different genetic operators, computational studies of the proposed algorithm on some randomly generated test problems are reported.

Introduction The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the well-studied NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems  [1]  and  [2] which determines the closed route of the shortest length or of the minimum cost (or time) passing through a given set of cities where each city is visited exactly once. Practical applications of the TSP include many problems in science and engineering, like vehicle routing, wiring, scheduling, flexible manufacturing, VLSI layout, etc. In the existing literature, a large number of approaches both by exact and heuristic methods (including genetic algorithms (GAs)) have been developed by several researchers for solving symmetric TSPs (STSPs). Exact methods include cutting plane, LP relaxation  [3] , branch and bound (B&B)  [4] , B&B based on assignment problem (AP) relaxation  [5] , [6]  and  [7] , branch and cut (B&C)  [8] , [9]  and  [10] and dynamic programming  [11]  and  [12] . However, very small size problems can be solved by exact methods. On the other hand, large size problems have been solved using heuristic and probabilistic methods like 2-opt  [1] , [13]  and  [14] , Markov chain  [15] , metaheuristic algorithms like Tabu Search  [16] , [17]  and  [18] , neural networks  [19] , simulated annealing  [20] , [21] , [22] , [23] , [24] , [25]  and  [26] and genetic algorithms (GAs)  [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , [32]  and  [33] . For further improvement of GAs for STSPs, many approaches have been suggested. Among these approaches, the works of Yang and Stacey  [34] , Ray et al.  [35] , Baraglia et al.  [36] , Gang et al.  [37] , Tsai et al.  [38] , Liu et al.  [39] and Al-Dulaimi and Ali  [40] are worth mentioning. Comprehensive review of the methods developed for STSPs can be found in  [2] , [41] , [42]  and  [43] . On the other hand, according to the existing literature, ATSP has not been well researched and many heuristics that are successful for STSPs cannot be applied efficiently to ATSPs. An ATSP with n n cities can be transformed to STSP with 2n 2 n cities  [44] . However, as most of the TSP applications are of asymmetric nature, further research is necessary for developing good heuristic algorithms for ATSPs. Among them, one may refer to the works of Smith et al.  [45] , Carpaneto and Toth  [46] , Cirasella et al.  [47] , Burke et al.  [48] , Johnson et al.  [49] and Choi et al.  [50] . To the best of our knowledge, generally, the distance/cost parameters have been used in the concerned TSPs of the aforesaid works and those parameters were specified precisely by fixed real numbers. However, due to the competitive market situation of present-day scenario, consideration of traveling times between two cities will be more appropriate instead of distance/cost parameters. Moreover, in real life situations of the third-world countries, the traveling times from one city to another would be imprecise instead of precise (fixed) numbers due to several diverse situations arising from traffic jam, bad condition of road/railway track, rainy/foggy weather, etc. for which there prevails a poor transport system. Thus, in real life considerations, the time parameters are flexible in nature and their values lie within intervals and so an I-ATSP can be framed. To solve this type of I-ATSP, order relations between interval numbers are essential. To the best of our knowledge, very few researchers defined order relations between interval valued numbers. Among them, one may refer to the works of Ishibuchi and Tanaka  [51] and Chanas and Kuchta  [52] . However, their definitions are not complete. Sengupta and Pal  [53] proposed two different approaches (one is deterministic and the other is fuzzy) to compare any two interval numbers with respect to the decision makers’ (optimistic and pessimistic) point of view. However, in some cases, both of their approaches fail to find the order relation between two interval numbers (see  [54] for details). Again, Majumdar and Bhunia  [54] studied and solved assignment problem with interval cost(s)/time(s) by elitist GA where they proposed revised definitions of order relations of interval numbers with respect to optimistic as well as pessimistic decision maker’s point of view. But, for some particular cases, their definition also fails to find the order relation. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are relatively new robust metaheuristics based on the ideas borrowed from natural selection and natural genetics. These are known to be a promising tool for solving a wide variety of real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Unlike traditional heuristics and some metaheuristics like Tabu search, GAs work with a population of feasible solutions (known as chromosomes) iteratively by successively applying three basic genetic operators, viz. selection, crossover and mutation in each iteration (called generation) until a termination criterion is satisfied. The basic structure of a simple GA (SGA) is shown in Fig. 1 .
