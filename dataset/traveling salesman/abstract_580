Currently, there exists a large number of nature-inspired algorithms for (he TSP and for some of these approaches very good performance is reported. In particular, the best performing approaches combine solution modification or construction with the subsequent application of a fast and effective local search algorithm. Yet, comparisons between these algorithms with respect to performance are often difficult due to different implementation choices of which the one of the local search algorithm is particularly critical. In this article we experimentally compare some of the best performing recently proposed nature-inspired algorithms which improve solutions by using a same local search algorithm and investigate their performance on a large set of benchmark instances.
