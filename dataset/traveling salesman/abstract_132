A Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is presented in this paper. TSP is a problem of finding a shortest closed tour which visits all the cities in a given set. The BCO model is constructed algorithmically based on the collective intelligence shown in bee foraging behaviour. This method uses a natural metaphor in making it as a optimization algorithm. Bees of an artificial colony are able to construct consecutively feasible tours by using information expressed in waggle dances. Experimental results comparing the proposed BCO model with some existing approaches on a set of benchmark problems are presented.
