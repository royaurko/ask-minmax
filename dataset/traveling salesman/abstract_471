In the optimization process of some ordering problems, we compare them to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and put forward the conception of a virtual map. Based on this conception, the problems are all put into the framework of the dynamic traveling salesman problem (DTSP). The paper makes a lot of comparisons between TSP and DTSP about their characteristics, and finds out the commonality and differences between them. At the same time, we consider that the presentation of DTSP conception is attributed to the rise of modern optimization methods founded on probability, and evolutionary computation is one of the best algorithms to solve DTSP nowadays
