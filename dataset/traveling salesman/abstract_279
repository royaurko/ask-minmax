The probabilistic traveling salesman problem (PTSP) is an important theoretical and practical topic in the study of stochastic network problems. It provides researchers with a modeling framework for exploring the stochastic effects in routing problems. This paper focuses on developing the hybrid scatter search (HSS) by incorporating the nearest neighbor rule (NNR), threshold accepting (TA) and edge recombination (ER) crossover into a scatter search conceptual framework to solve the PTSP. A set of numerical experiments were conducted to test the validity of the HSS based on the test problems from Tang and Miller-Hooks’ study. The numerical results showed that the HSS can effectively solve the PTSP in most of the tested cases in terms of objective function value. Moreover, the results also indicated that incorporating threshold accepting into the scatter search framework can further increase the computation efficiency while maintaining solution quality. These findings show the potential of the proposed HSS in solving the large-scale PTSP. Keywords Stochastic combinatorial optimization ; Probabilistic traveling salesman problem ; Scatter search ; Threshold accepting ; Edge recombination crossover The probabilistic traveling salesman problem (PTSP), a type of NP-hard problem, is a basic stochastic optimization problem [1] , [2]  and  [3] . Due to the fact that the element of uncertainty not only exists, but also significantly affects, the system performance in many real-world transportation and logistic applications, the results from the PTSP can provide insights into research into other stochastic combinatorial optimization problems. The PTSP can be used to model many real-world applications in logistical and transportation planning, such as daily pickup–delivery services with stochastic demand, job sequencing involving changeover cost [4] , design of retrieval sequences in a warehouse or in a cargo terminal operations [5] , meals on wheels in senior citizen services [6] , trip-chaining activities [7] , and vehicle routing problem with stochastic demand [8] . The PTSP is an extension of the well-known traveling salesman problem (TSP), which has been extensively studied in the field of combinatorial optimization. The goal of the TSP is to find the minimum length of a tour to all customers, given the distances between all pairs of customers. The objective of the PTSP is to minimize the expected length of the a priori tour where each customer requires a visit only with a given probability. The a priori tour can be seen as a template for the visiting sequence of all customers. In a given instance, the customers should be visited based on the sequence of the a priori tour while the customers who do not need to be visited will simply be skipped. The TSP can be treated as a special case of the PTSP. The main difference between PTSP and TSP is that in PTSP the probability of each node being visited is between 0.0 and 1.0 while in TSP the probability of each node being visited is 1.0. The closed form expressions and asymptotic analysis as well as combinatorial properties for computing the a priori expected length of any given PTSP tour were first developed by Jaillet [1] , [4]  and  [9] . Computational studies of several heuristic approaches modified from the TSP (e.g., nearest neighbor, savings approach, spacefilling curve, radical sorting, 1-shift, 2-opt and 3-opt exchanges) were analyzed by Bertsimas et al. [8] , Bertsimas and Howell [10] , Bianchi et al. [11] , and Rossi and Gavioli [12] . By using stochastic integer programming formulation, an exact algorithm based on an integer L-shaped method has been used to solve 50-node instances [13] . To efficiently and effectively solve the large-scale PTSP, recent studies focus on adopting new algorithmic approaches based on meta-heuristics such as ant colony optimization (ACO) [14] , [15]  and  [16] , genetic algorithm [17] , simulated annealing [18] , and threshold accepting (TA) [7] . Lately, scatter search, a conceptual framework of the population-based evolutionary meta-heuristics optimization method, has been shown to yield promising outcomes for solving various complicated optimization problems [19] , [20]  and  [21] . Moreover, several studies have found that the scatter search performed better than some widely used meta-heuristics such as genetic algorithm [22] , [23]  and  [24] , simulated annealing [23] and tabu search [25]  and  [26] . Therefore, based on a scatter search framework, this study devises and tests a hybrid optimization procedure for solving the PTSP. Even though numerous studies have attested to the potential efficacy of scatter searches [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] , [23] , [24] , [25] , [26]  and  [27] , an in-depth review of the literature revealed that no attempts have yet been made to solve the TSP and PTSP by scatter searches. Furthermore, despite the fact pioneers in the area have developed the conceptual framework of a scatter search for complicated optimization problems, the algorithmic procedure involved in each of the proposed components of the scatter search cannot be generalized to other problem types and needs to be carefully redesigned, refined and redefined so as to better fit the specific problem at hand. Therefore, this study designs a hybrid scatter search (HSS) procedure for solving the PTSP by incorporating the nearest neighbor rule (NNR), TA, and edge recombination (ER) crossover operator to further expand the conceptual framework and implementation of the scatter search. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed HSS, a set of test problems with various numbers of nodes (50,75,100) ( 50 , 75 , 100 ) , each with different presence probability intervals (0.0–0.2, 0.0–0.5, 0.0–1.0) as used in Tang and Miller-Hooks [7] are adopted for the purpose of comparison. The comparative results obtained can substantiate the potential of the HSS in solving the PTSP, one of the most frequently encountered problem types in real-world applications. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the expressions for evaluating the a priori tour for the PTSP. Section 3 presents the details of the HSS for the PTSP. Section 4 describes the design of the numerical experiment. The results of the numerical experiments are presented and discussed in Section 5 , followed by concluding comments.
