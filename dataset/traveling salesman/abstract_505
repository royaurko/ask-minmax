Tables: Generally Applicable Heuristics for Global Optimisation: An Investigation of Algorithm Performance for the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (1994) @TECHREPORT{Telfar94generallyapplicable,     author = {Grant Telfar},     title = {Generally Applicable Heuristics for Global Optimisation: An Investigation of Algorithm Performance for the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem},     institution = {},     year = {1994} } The purpose of this reading paper is to empirically analyse and compare several heuristic algorithms that can be applied to combinatorial optimisation problems. The main focus of the paper is heuristic paradigms that are generally applicable to a wide variety of problem types. The three techniques investigated here are repeated local search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Each heuristic is investigated individually, with a small amount of theoretical discussion, to determine how the performance of each method can be changed by altering algorithm parameters. The Traveling Salesman Problem is used as a problem indicative of combinatorial optimisation to test the three heuristics. It is an NP-hard problem that shares many properties common to other combinatorial optimisation problems and it is hoped that the behaviour of the heuristics when applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem will be similar to that experienced for other combinatorial problems. To gain some insight int...
