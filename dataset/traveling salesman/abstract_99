There are currently three general classes of such heuristics: classical tour construction heuristics such as Nearest Neighbor and the Greedy algorithm, local search algorithms based on re-arranging segments of the tour, as exemplified by the Kanellakis-Papadimitriou algorithm [ KP80 ], and algorithms based on patching together the cycles in a minimum cycle cover, the best of which are variants on an algorithm proposed by Zhang [ Zha93 ]. We test implementations of the main contenders from each class on a variety of instance types, introducing a variety of new random instance generators modeled on real-world applications of the ATSP. Among the many tentative conclusions we reach is that no single algorithm is dominant over all instance classes, although for each class the best tours are found either by Zhang’s algorithm or an iterated variant on Kanellakis-Papadimitriou.
