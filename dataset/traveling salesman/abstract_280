  Generalized chromosome genetic algorithm (GCGA) was proposed for solving generalized traveling salesman problems (GTSP) as reported in the authors’ earlier work. Theoretically, the GCGA could also be used to solve the classical traveling salesman problem (CTSP), which has not been reported by others. In this paper, the generalized chromosome characteristics are analyzed and the feasibility for consistently solving the GTSP and CTSP is verified. Numerical experiments show the advantages of the GCGA for solving a large-scale CTSP. Keywords Chromosome ; Genetic algorithm ; Solution space ; Generalized traveling salesman problem 1. Introduction The generalized traveling salesman problem (GTSP) is a combinatorial computation model with a wider application scope compared to classical traveling salesman problem (CTSP). Usually, a GTSP can be transformed to a CTSP [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6]  and  [7] , and then can be solved by most of the existing algorithms designed for solving CTSPs. However, the transformation causes the dimension to increase drastically [2] , [5] , [6]  and  [7] . Due to the increasing dimension and NP-hard property, the transformed problems are usually more difficult to be handled compared with the original ones. Hence, it is practically improper, although feasible theoretically, to deal with the transformed equations. In the past decades, heuristic algorithms based on computational intelligence showed their potential in solving NP-hard problems. Neural networks, genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and some others have been applied widely to solve the CTSP. However, the distinct trait that the vertices are grouped in GTSP makes most of the existing CTSP approaches invalid for GTSP. To the best of our knowledge, there are very few computational intelligence-based methods proposed for GTSP [8] , [9]  and  [10] . In our earlier work [8] we designed a novel chromosome structure named generalized chromosome (GC), and proposed a GC-based genetic algorithm (GCGA) and presented the testing results on both benchmark data and real problems. The algorithm presented is extended in this study to analyze the generalized chromosome characteristics in Section 2 . Verifications of the feasibilities for consistently solving the GTSP and the CTSP are presented in Section 3 . The last section is devoted to conclusions and discussions. 2. Algorithm analysis The generalized chromosome structure proposed in Ref. [8] is shown in Fig. 1 , where m ˆ and m ˜ are numbers of super vertices and scattering vertices, respectively. Generally, the GC can be used to code the GTSP and CTSP hybrid problems, which means that there are vertex groups (the super vertices) as well as the ordinary vertices (the scattering vertices). The readers can refer to Ref. [8] for the detailed information about the GC and the GCGA, such as super vertices and scattering vertices. When we mention GTSP in this paper, we mean a GTSP and CTSP hybrid problem, i.e., m ˆ ≠ 0 and m ˜ ≠ 0 . Here we would like to elaborate two special cases: when the number of scattering vertices is 0, i.e., m ˜ = 0 , the “GTSP” is the same as the one mentioned in reported studies; when the number of super vertices is 0, i.e., m ˆ = 0 , the “GTSP” is a classical TSP. Therefore, the following conclusions are for the GTSP–CTSP hybrid problems, but they are also suitable for any special cases.
