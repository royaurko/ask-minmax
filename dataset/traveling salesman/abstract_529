This paper presents a formulation of the quadratic assignment problem, of which the Koopmans-Beckmann formulation is a special case. Various applications for the formulation are discussed. The equivalence of the problem to a linear assignment problem with certain additional constraints is demonstrated. A method for calculating a lower bound on the cost function is presented, and this forms the basis for an algorithm to determine optimal solutions. Further generalizations to cubic, quartic, N -adic problems are considered.
