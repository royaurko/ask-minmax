This paper surveys the “neurally” inspired problem-solving approaches to the traveling salesman problem, namely, the Hopfield-Tank network, the elastic net, and the self-organizing map. The latest achievements in the neural network domain are reported and numerical comparisons are provided with the classical solution approaches of operations research. An extensive bibliography with more than one hundred references is also included.
