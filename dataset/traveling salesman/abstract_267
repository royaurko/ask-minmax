The traveling salesman problem is one of the most famous combinatorial optimization problems and has been intensively studied. Many extensions to the basic problem have also been proposed, with the aim of making the resulting mathematical models as realistic as possible. We present a new extension to the basic problem, where travel times are specified as a range of possible values. This model reflects the intrinsic difficulties of estimating travel times in reality. We apply the robust deviation criterion to drive optimization over the interval data problem so obtained. Some interesting theoretical properties of the new optimization problems are identified and discussed, together with a new mathematical formulation and some exact and heuristic algorithms. Computational experiments are finally presented.
