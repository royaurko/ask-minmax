  In this paper, we present a new method, called the genetic simulated annealing ant colony system with particle swarm optimization techniques, for solving the traveling salesman problem. We also make experiments using the 25 data sets obtained from the TSPLIB ( http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/ ) and compare the experimental results of the proposed method with the methods of Angeniol, Vaubois, and Texier (1988) , Somhom, Modares, and Enkawa (1997) , Masutti and Castro (2009) and Pasti and Castro (2006) . The experimental results show that both the average solution and the percentage deviation of the average solution to the best known solution of the proposed method are better than the methods of Angeniol et al., 1988 , Angeniol et al., 1988 , Somhom et al., 1997 , Masutti and Castro, 2009  and  Pasti and Castro, 2006 . ► We propose a new method, called the genetic simulated annealing ant colony system with 21 particle swarm optimization techniques, for solving the traveling salesman problem. ► We also make experiments using the 25 data sets obtained from the TSPLIB ( http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/ ) and compare the experimental results of the proposed method with the methods of Angeniol et al., 1988 , Somhom et al., 1997 , Masutti and Castro, 2009  and  Pasti and Castro, 2006 . ► The experimental results show that both the average solution and the percentage deviation of the average solution to the best known solution of the proposed method are better than the methods of Angeniol et al., 1988 , Somhom et al., 1997 , Masutti and Castro, 2009  and  Pasti and Castro, 2006 .

The problem is to minimize the distance of the complete route, which the salesman takes. In recent years, some methods have been presented for solving the traveling salesman problem ( Angeniol et al., 1988 , Chang et al., 2010 , Chen and Chien, 2010 , Cheng and Wang, 2009 , Chen and Chien, 2009 , Ellabib et al., 2007 , Li et al., 2008 , Liu and Zeng, 2009 , Marinakis and Marinaki, 2010 , Naimi and Taherinejad, 2009 , Nguyen et al., 2007 , Saadatmand-Tarzjan et al., 2007 , Sauer and Coelho, 2008 , Shi et al., 2008 , Somhom et al., 1997 , Xie and J., 2008  and  Yi et al., 2008 ).

Genetic algorithms (GA) ( Gen and Cheng, 1997 , Goldberg, 1989 , Gwiazda, 2006  and  Gwiazda, 2007 ) have been widely used in the research area of computational intelligence. Genetic algorithms are inspired by evolutionary biology. Because genetic algorithms have the global searching ability and because they can be easily implemented, they are widely used in many areas.

Swarm intelligence is an important research topic in the research area of computational intelligence. It consists of a population of artificial agents mimicking the animals’ behavior in the real world. Each agent follows some simple rules and interacts with the others to share information to lead the behavior to convergence. The most popular algorithms in the research field of swarm intelligence are the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. The first ACO algorithm is the ant system (AS) proposed by Dorigo, 1992a  and  Dorigo, 1992b to solve the traveling salesman problem. Since then, some improved methods have been proposed, such as the ant colony system (ACS) ( Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997a , Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997b  and  Gambardella and Dorigo, 1996 ), the MAX–MIN ant system (MMAS) ( Stützle and Hoos, 1996  and  Stützle and Hoos, 2000 ), the rank-based ant system (AS rank ) ( Bullnheimer, Hartl, & Strauss, 1997 ) and the KCC-Ants ( Naimi & Taherinejad, 2009 ). Kennedy and Eberhart (1995) proposed the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm which is a population-based algorithm simulating the movements of birds flocks. Krohling and Coelho (2006) presented a co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization with Gaussian distribution for solving the constrained optimization problem.
