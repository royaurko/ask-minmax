  We develop k -interchange procedures to perform local search in a precedence-constrained routing problem. The problem in question is known in the Transportation literature as the single vehicle many-to-many Dial-A-Ride Problem, or DARP. The DARP is the problem of minimizing the length of the tour traveled by a vehicle to service N customers, each of whom wishes to go from a distinct origin to a distinct destination. The vehicle departs from a specified point and returns to that point upon service of all customers. Precedence constraints in the DARP exist because the origin of each customer must precede his/her destination on the route. As in the interchange procedure of Lin for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a k -interchange is a substitution of k of the links of an initial feasible DARP tour with k other links, and a DARP tour is k -optimal if it is impossible to obtain a shorter tour by replacing any k of its links by k other links. However, in contrast to the TSP where each individual interchange takes O(1) time, checking whether each individual DARP interchange satisfies the origin-destination precedence constraints normally requires O(N 2 ) time. In this paper we develop a method which still finds the best k-interchange that can be produced from an initial feasible DARP tour in O(N k ) time, the same order of magnitude as in the Lin heuristic for the TSP. This method is then embedded in a breadth-first or a depth-first search procedure to produce a k -optimal DARP tour. The paper focuses on the k = 2 and k = 3 cases. Experience with the procedures is presented. in which k -optimal tours are produced by applying a 2-opt or 3-opt search to initial DARP tours produced either randomly or by a fast O(N 2 ) heuristic. The breadth-first and depth-first search modes are compared. The heuristics are seen to produce very good or near-optimal DARP tours. [1] L.D. Bodin, B.L. Golden, M. Ball, A.
