The Traveling Salesman Problem with Backhauls (TSPB) is defined on a graph G = ( V , E ). The vertex set is partitioned into V = ({ v 1 }, L , B ), where v 1 is a depot, L is a set of linehaul customers, and B is a set of backhaul customers. A cost matrix satisfying the triangle inequality is defined on the edge set E . The TSPB consists of determining a least-cost Hamiltonian cycle on G such that all vertices of L are visited contiguously after v 1 , followed by all vertices of B . Following a result by Christofides for the Traveling Salesman Problem, we propose an approximation algorithm with worst-case performance ratio of 3/2 for the TSPB.
