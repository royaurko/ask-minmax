Password:   In this paper we propose a general algorithm for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP) on a complete digraph on n nodes which computes a tour with cost no more than a pre-specified upper bound. A special case of this algorithm is shown to have complexity O( n 2 ) and domination number at least . Extending this result, we show that by investing O( n k ) effort, for k ⩾2 and integer, it is possible to obtain a solution which is at least as good as alternative tours, where . Further, we present a patching algorithm for the ATSP and show that it has a domination number at least ( n −2)!. Since the symmetric traveling salesman problem can be formulated as an ATSP, these algorithms are applicable in this case too. However, in this case the guaranteed lower bound on the domination number would be half that of the corresponding ATSP algorithm.

Let A ( G )={ e 1 , e 2 ,…, e m } be the arc (edge) set of G and be the collection of all Hamiltonian cycles in G . For each arc (edge) e of G , a cost c ( e ) is prescribed. The vector C =( c ( e 1 ), c ( e 2 ),…, c ( e m )) of arc (edge) costs is called the cost vector . For any subgraph H of G , we denote . Then the traveling salesman problem (TSP) is to find a Hamiltonian cycle (tour) H in such that C ( H ) is as small as possible. When G is the complete directed graph D n , the TSP is referred to as the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). When G is the complete undirected graph K n , it is referred to as the symmetric traveling salesman problem (STSP). Both STSP and ATSP have been studied extensively in the literature [14] . For arbitrary arc (edge) costs, it is well known [14]  and  [21] that unless P = NP , no polynomial time approximation algorithm exists for ATSP (STSP) such that cost of the solution produced by the algorithm is guaranteed to be within a constant multiple of the optimal cost. Thus, obtaining a performance guarantee for heuristics which depends totally on the objective function value seems almost impossible. Recently, Glover and Punnen [7] considered domination analysis as a way of analyzing the quality of a heuristic solution. For some preliminary ideas on domination analysis, we refer to the work of Glover [6] that introduced the concept of ccombinatorial leverage and the papers by Sarvanov and Doroshko [20] , Sarvanov [19] and Gutin [8]  and  [9] that considered neighborhoods of factorial size in which the best member can be identified in polynomial time. For more recent works in this direction, we refer to [1] , [2] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [15] , [16] , [23]  and  [17] . Domination analysis deals with the number of solutions with objective function value greater than or equal to that of the solution produced by a heuristic. Let α be a heuristic algorithm for the (symmetric or asymmetric) traveling salesman problem. For any cost vector C , let H α , C be the solution produced by α and let . Then the domination number of α with respect to a domain of cost vector C is given by When is denoted by dom ( α ). For any heuristic α for the ATSP or STSP, the domination number exists and it is at least one, as these problems are always feasible. If , then α is an exact algorithm producing an optimal solution. Thus, it is interesting to develop heuristic algorithms with domination number close to .
