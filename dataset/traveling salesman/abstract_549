Password: We consider the ordered cluster traveling salesman problem (OCTSP). In this problem, a vehicle starting and ending at a given depot must visit a set of n points. The points are partitioned into K,K⩽n , prespecified clusters. The vehicle must first visit the points in cluster 1, then the points in cluster 2,… , and finally the points in cluster K so that the distance traveled is minimized. We present a -approximation algorithm for this problem which runs in O( n 3 ) time. We show that our algorithm can also be applied to the path version of the OCTSP: the ordered cluster traveling salesman path problem (OCTSPP). Here the (different) starting and ending points of the vehicle may or may not be prespecified. For this problem, our algorithm is also a -approximation algorithm.

In this problem, a vehicle starting and ending at a given depot must visit a set of n points partitioned into K disjoint clusters so that points of cluster k are visited prior to points of cluster k +1, for k =1,2,…, K −1, and the total distance traveled is minimum. We assume a complete undirected graph G =( V , E ) where K +1 clusters denoted C i ⊆ V , for each i =0,1,2,…, K , are prespecified. We assume C i ∩ C j =∅ for all 1⩽i,j⩽K,i≠j , and C 0 consists of a single node denoted by 0∈ V which we refer to as the depot , i.e., C 0 ={0}. The ordered cluster TSP (OCTSP) is the problem of determining the minimum length tour that starts and ends at the depot and visits each node of V in such a way that all nodes of C i are visited before any of the nodes in C i +1 , for i =1,2,…, K −1. Since this is a generalization of the TSP (the TSP is the OCTSP with K =1) the problem is -hard. In the OCTSP, the clusters as well as the order of the clusters are considered prespecified . We also consider the path version of this same problem, the ordered cluster traveling salesman path problem (OCTSPP), as well as the version where no depot is specified and we seek only a closed tour through the clusters in the required order. The OCTSP is a variant of the free cluster TSP (FCTSP), where the cluster order is not prespecified. In the FCTSP, the problem is to simultaneously determine the optimal cluster order as well as the routing within and between clusters. These models have well-known applications in automated warehouse routing (see [2]  and  [9] ) and production planning ( [9] ). Other applications involve service systems where customers have different service priorities (see [6] ). The special case of K =2 is often called the traveling salesman problem with Backhauls (TSPB) (see [5] ). We seek polynomial-time approximation algorithms. An algorithm is an α - approximation algorithm if it constructs a solution whose length is guaranteed to be within α of the length of an optimal solution. For the TSP, a well-known -approximation algorithm is Christofides’ Heuristic [3] . Approximation algorithms for the OCTSP include the 2-approximation O( n 2 ) algorithm of Gendreau et al. [6] . For the special case of K =2, Gendreau et al. [5] provide a -approximation algorithm. For the FCTSP, Arkin et al. [1] provide a 3.5-approximation algorithm, and recently, Guttmann-Beck et al. [7] developed a 2.75-approximation algorithm. In this paper, we present a -approximation algorithm for the OCTSP which runs in O( n 3 ) time. It is an adaptation of Christofides’ Heuristic for the TSP. We also show that the same performance guarantee is achieved when these ideas are applied to the OCTSPP. 2.
