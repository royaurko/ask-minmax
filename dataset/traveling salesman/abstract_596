A method for accelerating the computational performance of branch exchange heuristics for symmetric traveling salesman problems (TSP's) is presented. The improvement in performance is obtained by considering only exchanges that have a good chance of producing a better solution. In the instance of the 3â€“optimal heuristic, the approach reduces the number of operations required to obtain a good solution to a TSP with N nodes from O(N 3 ) to O(N 2 ) , without a corresponding degradation in the quality of the solution. Most of the results are produced for Euclidean TSP's, but evidence is presented that indicates that thes results apply equally well if not more strongly to the general symmetric TSP.
