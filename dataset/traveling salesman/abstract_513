Its performance will be analyzed when solving of dierent instances of the traveling salesman problem and will be compared to two existing previous models, the Ant System and the Ant Colony System. 1 Introduction In the last few years, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [6] has appeared as a new bio-inspired meta-heuristic to solve many complex optimization problems. ACO algorithms mimic the behavior of natural ant colonies. They are thus based on the cooperation among multiple agents, ants, every one generating a possible solution to the problem in each algorithm iteration. To do so, each ant travels a graph which represents a specic problem instance and makes use of two infomation types that are common to the whole colony and specify the preference of the graph edges at every moment: Heuristic information, which depends on the specic problem ins...
