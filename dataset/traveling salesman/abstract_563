We define a new family of valid inequalities for the Symmetric Traveling Salesman Polytope ( STSP ( n )), that is, the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all Hamiltonian cycles of a complete graph with n nodes. The smallest value of n for which the inequalities are defined is 8. We call these inequalities crown inequalities and we prove that they are facet-inducing for STSP ( n ), for n â‰¥ 8. We describe some extensions of the crown inequalities and we prove that they induce facets of STSP ( n ), as well. Finally, we discuss some issues on the possible applications of these inequalities in a polyhedral cutting-plane algorithm.
