A formulation of the traveling salesman problem with more than one salesman is offered. The particular formulation has computational advantages over other formulations. Experience is obtained with an exact branch and bound algorithm employing both upper and lower bounds (mean run time for 55 city problems is one minute). Due to the special formulation, certain subtours may satisfy the constraints, thus reducing the search. A very good initial tour and upper bound are employed. The determination of these as well as the pathology of the formulation and the algorithm are discussed. No increase in computation time over the one-salesman case is experienced.
