This paper describes how to solve very large Traveling- Salesman Problems heuristically by the parallelization of self-organizing maps on cluster architectures. The used way of parallelizing is a sophisticated Structural Data Parallel approach based on the SPMD model. We distinguish between a non-sophisticated and a sophisticated approach for efficient and simple parallelization of the SOMs. Hannes Schabauer, Erich Schikuta, Thomas Weishaupl, "Solving Very Large Traveling Salesman Problems by SOM Parallelization on Cluster Architectures", PDCAT , 2005, Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies, Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies 2005, pp. 954-958, doi:10.1109/PDCAT.2005.223
