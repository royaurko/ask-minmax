  A procedure of the dynamic programming (DP) for the discrete-continuous problem of a route optimization is considered. It is possible to consider this procedure as a dynamic method of optimization of the towns choice in the well-known traveling salesman problem. In the considered version of DP, elements of a dynamic optimization are used. Two variants of the function of the aggregations of losses are investigated: 1. (1) the additive functions; 2. (2) the function characterizing the aggregation of losses in the bottle-neck problem.
