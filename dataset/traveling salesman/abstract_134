  Optimal foraging models are examined that assume animals forage for discrete point resources on a plane and attempt to minimize their travel distance between resources. This problem is similar to the well-known traveling salesman problem: A salesman must choose the shortest path from his home office to all cities on his itinerary and back to his home office again. The traveling salesman problem is in a class of enigmatic problems, called NP-complete, which can be so difficult to solve that animals might be incapable of finding the best solution. Two major results of this analysis are: (1) The simple foraging strategy of always moving to the closest resource site does surprisingly well. More sophisticated strategies of “looking ahead” a small number of steps, choosing the shortest path, then taking a step, do worse if all the resource sites are visited, but do slightly better (less than 10%) if not all the resource sites are visited. (2) Short cyclical foraging routes resulted when resources were allowed to renew. This is suggested as an alternative explanation for “trap-lining” in animals that forage for discrete, widely separated resources. Present address: Solaster Software Corporation, P. O.
