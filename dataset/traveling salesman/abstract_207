The goal is to find an a priori tour of minimal expected length over all customers, with the strategy of visiting a random subset of customers in the same order as they appear in the a priori tour. We propose an ant based a priori tour construction heuristic, the probabilistic Ant Colony System (pACS), which is derived from ACS, a similar heuristic previously designed for the TSP problem. We show that pACS finds better solutions than other tour construction heuristics for a wide range of homogeneous customer probabilities. We also show that for high customers probabilities ACS solutions are better than pACS solutions.
