The Annals of Probability Description: The purpose of The Annals of Probability is to publish contributions to the theory of probability and statistics and their applications. The emphasis is on importance and interest; formal novelty and mathematical correctness alone are not sufficient. Also appropriate are authoritative expository papers and surveys of areas in vigorous development. All papers are refereed. Coverage: 1973-2011 (Vol. 1, No. 1 - Vol. 39, No. 6) Moving Wall The "moving wall" represents the time period between the last issue available in JSTOR and the most recently published issue of a journal. Moving walls are generally represented in years. In rare instances, a publisher has elected to have a "zero" moving wall, so their current issues are available in JSTOR shortly after publication. Note: In calculating the moving wall, the current year is not counted. For example, if the current year is 2008 and a journal has a 5 year moving wall, articles from the year 2002 are available. Terms Related to the Moving Wall Fixed walls: Journals with no new volumes being added to the archive. Absorbed: Journals that are combined with another title. Complete: Journals that are no longer published or that have been combined with another title. Subjects: Science & Mathematics, Statistics
