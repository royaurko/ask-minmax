Evolution in time and space - the parallel genetic algorithm (1991) @INPROCEEDINGS{Muhlenbein91evolutionin,     author = {Heinz Muhlenbein},     title = {Evolution in time and space - the parallel genetic algorithm},     booktitle = {Foundations of Genetic Algorithms},     year = {1991},     pages = {316--337},     publisher = {Morgan Kaufmann} } Years of Citing Articles The parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) uses two major modi cations compared to the genetic algorithm. Firstly, selection for mating is distributed. Individuals live ina2-Dworld. Selection of a mate is done by each individual independently in its neighborhood. Secondly, each individual may improve its tness during its lifetime by e.g. local hill-climbing. The PGA is totally asynchronous, running with maximal e ciency on MIMD parallel computers. The search strategy of the PGA is based on a small number of active and intelligent individuals, whereas a GA uses a large population of passive individuals. We will investigate the PGA with deceptive problems and the traveling salesman problem. We outline why and when the PGA is succesful. Abstractly, a PGA is a parallel search with information exchange between the individuals. If we represent the optimization problem as a tness landscape in a certain con guration space, we see, that a PGA tries to jump from two local minima to a third, still better local minima, by using the crossover operator. This jump is (probabilistically) successful, if the tness landscape has a certain correlation. We showthe correlation for the traveling salesman problem by a con guration space analysis. The PGA explores implicitly the above correlation. Citation Context ...sexual reproduction with mutation and selection.
