Recently, several general optimization algorithms based on the demon algorithm from statistical physics have been developed and tested on a few traveling salesman problems with encouraging results. In this paper, we conduct an extensive computational study of 11 annealing-based heuristics for the traveling salesman problem. We code versions of simulated annealing, threshold accepting, record-to-record travel and eight heuristics based on the demon algorithm. We apply each heuristic to 29 traveling salesman problems taken from a well-known online library, compare the results with respect to accuracy and running time and provide insights and suggestions for future work
