We consider partitioning algorithms for the approximate solution of large instances of the traveling-salesman problem in the plane. These algorithms subdivide the set of cities into small groups, construct an optimum tour through each group, and then patch the subtours together to form a tour through all the cities. If the number of cities in the problem is n , and the number of cities in each group is t , then the worst-case error is $O(\sqrt{n/t})$ . If the cities are randomly distributed, then the relative error is O ( t âˆ’1/2 ) (with probability one). Hybrid schemes are suggested, in which partitioning is used in conjunction with existing heuristic algorithms. These hybrid schemes may be expected to give near-optimum solutions to problems with thousands of cities.
