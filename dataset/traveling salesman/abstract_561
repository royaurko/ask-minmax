The fixed charge symmetric multiple traveling salesmen problem with n cities and m salesmen is transformed to a standard symmetric traveling salesman problem with n + m âˆ’ 1 cities. The asymmetric problem with m = 2 and a different base city for each salesman is also transformed to a standard asymmetric traveling salesman problem.
