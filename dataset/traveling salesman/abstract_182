Abstract: Several heuristic procedures based on geometric concepts have been developed for the Chebyshev (or too) Traveling Salesman Problem (CTSP),which has numerous applications in materials handling and information storage-retrieval. The following study is concerned with evaluating the performance of geometric approaches as a function of the shape of the service region and the number of points to be sequenced. A new approach, the band insertion heuristic, is also introduced and compared with existing procedures. Trade-offs in tour quality and solution effort are the primary focus of the study, which is empirical in nature; however, the results generally apply to a wide range of configurations.
