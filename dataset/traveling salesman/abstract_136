Volume 12 of the series Combinatorial Optimization pp 1-28 The Traveling Salesman Problem: Applications, Formulations and Variations Abraham P. Punnen Affiliated with Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of New Brunswick-Saint John The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is to find a routing of a salesman who starts from a home location, visits a prescribed set of cities and returns to the original location in such a way that the total distance travelled is minimum and each city is visited exactly once. Although a business tour of a modern day traveling salesman may not seem to be too complex in terms of route planning, the TSP in its generality represents a typical ‘hard’ combinatorial optimization problem.
