  This paper describes tabu search and its application to the symmetric TSP, which is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. The performance of tabu search is compared to the K-OPT procedure using six test problems drawn from the literature. Although K-OPT is not the fastest TSP solution method, it is widely recognized as a performance benchmark. The primary features of both the tabu search and K-OPT computer programs are described. Additional comments about tabu search in general and some factors which influence the performance of tabu search are provided. 1. E.L. Lawler, J.K. Lenstra, A.H.G.Rinnooy Kan, D.B.
