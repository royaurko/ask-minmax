Volume 2748 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 307-318 The Traveling Salesman Problem for Cubic Graphs DavidÂ Eppstein Affiliated with School of Information & Computer Science, University of California, Irvine We show how to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph of degree at most three with n vertices, in time \(\mathcal{O}(2^{n/3}) \approx {\rm 1.25992}^n\) and linear space. Our algorithm can find the minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle (traveling salesman problem), in the same time bound, and count the number of Hamiltonian cycles in time \(\mathcal{O}(2^{3n/8}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}) \approx {\rm 1.29684}^n\) . We also solve the traveling salesman problem in graphs of degree at most four, by a randomized (Monte Carlo) algorithm with runtime \(\mathcal{O}((27/4)^{n/3}) \approx {\rm 1.88988}^n\) . Our algorithms allow the input to specify a set of forced edges which must be part of any generated cycle.
