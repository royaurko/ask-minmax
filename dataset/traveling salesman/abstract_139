Two exact algorithms, incorporating lower bounds provided by a Lagrangean relaxation of the problem, are presented. We also investigate a heuristic procedure derived from dynamic programming that is able to evaluate the distance from optimality of the produced solution. Computational results for a number of problems ranging from 15 to 60 cities are given. They show that problems up to 35 cities can be solved exactly and problems up to 60 cities can be solved within 3% from optimality. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
