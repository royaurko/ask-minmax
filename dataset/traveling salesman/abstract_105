We propose a novel approach for combinatorial optimization problems. For solving the traveling salesman problems, we combine chaotic neurodynamics with heuristic algorithm. We select the heuristic algorithm of 2-opt as a basic part, because it is well understood that this simple algorithm is very effective for the traveling salesman problems. Although the conventional approaches with chaotic neurodynamics were only applied to such very small problems as 10 cities, our method exhibits higher performance for larger size problems with the order of 1 0 2 .
