December 1985 , Volume 4, Issue 1, pp 285-305 First online: Local search in routing problems with time windows M. W. P. Savelsbergh Affiliated with Department of Operations Research and System Theory, Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science We develop local search algorithms for routing problems with time windows. The presented algorithms are based on the k -interchange concept. The presence of time windows introduces feasibility constraints, the checking of which normally requires O( N ) time. Our method reduces this checking effort to O(1) time. We also consider the problem of finding initial solutions. A complexity result is given and an insertion heuristic is described.
