Traveling Salesman Problem is an important optimization issue of many fields such as transportation, logistics and semiconductor industries and it is about finding a Hamiltonian path with minimum cost. To solve this problem, many researchers have proposed different approaches including metaheuristic methods. Artificial Bee Colony algorithm is a well known swarm based optimization technique. In this paper we propose a new Artificial Bee Colony algorithm called Combinatorial ABC for Traveling Salesman Problem. Simulation results show that this Artificial Bee Colony algorithm can be used for combinatorial optimization problems.
