An O(log n/log log n)-approximation algorithm for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem Author: Asadpour, Arash; Goemans, Michel X.; Madry, Aleksander; Gharan, Shayan Oveis; Saberi, Amin Department: Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Department of Mathematics; Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory; Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Publisher: Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Date Issued: 2010-01 Abstract: We consider the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman problem for costs satisfying the triangle inequality. We derive a randomized algorithm which delivers a solution within a factor O(log n/ log log n) of the optimum with high probability. URL to paper on conference site Citation: Asadpour, Arash, et al.
