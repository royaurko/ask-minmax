The aim of this paper is to present a new heuristic method for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows, based on the solution of an auxiliary problem. The idea is to solve an assignment problem with an ad hoc objective function to obtain a solution close enough to a feasible solution of the original problem. Given this solution, made by a long main tour containing the depot and few small subtours, it is easy to insert all the subtours into the main path using a greedy insertion procedure. The algorithm described applies the proposed constructive scheme and then uses a local search procedure to improve the initial solution. The computational results show the effectiveness of this approach.
