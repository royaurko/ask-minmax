This paper addresses a variation of the traveling salesman problem with pickup and delivery in which loading and unloading operations have to be executed in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order. We introduce three new local search operators for this problem, which are then embedded within a variable neighborhood search heuristic. We evaluate the performance of the heuristic on data adapted from TSPLIB instances.
