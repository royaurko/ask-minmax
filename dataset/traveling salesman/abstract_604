Computer Science > Neural and Evolutionary Computing Title: A Comparative Study of Adaptive Crossover Operators for Genetic Algorithms to Resolve the Traveling Salesman Problem (Submitted on 14 Mar 2012) Abstract: Genetic algorithm includes some parameters that should be adjusting so that the algorithm can provide positive results. Crossover operators play very important role by constructing competitive Genetic Algorithms (GAs). In this paper, the basic conceptual features and specific characteristics of various crossover operators in the context of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) are discussed. The results of experimental comparison of more than six different crossover operators for the TSP are presented. The experiment results show that OX operator enables to achieve a better solutions than other operators tested.
