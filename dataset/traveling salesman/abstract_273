  In this paper, we consider scheduling problems on a single machine in a sequence dependent setup environment. For these problems, we introduce several integer programming formulations of varying size and strength. Computational experiments conducted on instances of 1|s ij |∑C j 1 | s i j | ∑ C j (i.e. minimizing total flow time on a single machine under sequence dependent setup times) and 1|s ij |∑T j 1 | s i j | ∑ T j (i.e. minimizing total tardiness on a single machine under sequence dependent setup times) illustrate the benefits of using stronger formulations, even though the computation of their LP relaxation is more time consuming. Incorporating these improved LP relaxation bounds, we propose an exact branch-and-bound algorithm able to solve instances of 1|s ij |∑C j 1 | s i j | ∑ C j and 1|s ij |∑T j 1 | s i j | ∑ T j having up to 50 and 45 jobs respectively.

Introduction Most of the research on scheduling problems has been done under the assumption that setup times are independent of job sequence. However, in some contexts (see Gagne et al. [12] for an example in the aluminum industry), sequence dependent setup time s ij s i j occurs in the schedule if job j j is processed right after job i i . Production of good schedules often relies on management of these setup times. In this paper, we consider single machine scheduling problems in sequence dependent setup environments and we exhibit how these problems present similarities with the time-dependent traveling salesman problem, a variant of the famous traveling salesman problem in which transition costs between two cities now depends on the time of the visit. Different integer programming formulations of this problem are presented and we show how they can be used to develop efficient solution approaches for two single machine scheduling problems, 1|s ij |∑C j 1 | s i j | ∑ C j and especially 1|s ij |∑T j 1 | s i j | ∑ T j , in which we respectively attempt to minimize flow time and sum of the tardiness in a single machine sequence dependent setup environment. With these approaches, we indeed solved to optimality all instances of 1|s ij |∑T j 1 | s i j | ∑ T j , proposed by Rubin and Ragatz  [26] and studied by other authors [12]  and  [28] that were considered open. The paper is organized as follows. In Section  2 , we present a brief literature review on scheduling problems with setup considerations involving makespan, total flow time or total tardiness objectives. In Section  3 , we introduced some formulations of the time-dependent traveling salesman problem and we show how they can be used to model different single machine scheduling problems. In Section  4 , we show how it is possible to strengthen these formulations by using the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition principle (1960) and known cuts of the classical traveling salesman and node packing problem. In Section  5 , we describe a branch-and-bound algorithm able to exploit the lower bounds given by LP relaxation of the various formulations presented here and we test it on several instances of 1|s ij |∑C j 1 | s i j | ∑ C j and 1|s ij |∑T j 1 | s i j | ∑ T j . In the last section, we present some conclusions and future directions of research.
