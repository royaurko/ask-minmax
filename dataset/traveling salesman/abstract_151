We show that both reoptimization problems are NP-hard. Moreover, we show that, while the cheapest insertion heuristic has a tight worst-case ratio equal to 2 when applied to a TSP instance, it guarantees, in linear time, a tight worst-case ratio equal to 3/2 when used to add the new node and that also the simplest heuristic to remove a node from the optimal tour guarantees a tight ratio equal to 3/2 in constant time.
