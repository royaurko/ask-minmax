We present new lower bounds that are derived from the linear relaxation of the new formulation by adding valid inequalities, in a cutting-plane fashion. The resulting lower bounds are embedded in a branch-and-cut algorithm for the optimal solution of the TSPDC. Computational results on different classes of test problems taken from the literature indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
