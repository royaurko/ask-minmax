We show that for any such norm, the problem of finding a tour of maximum length can be solved in polynomial time. If arithmetic operations are assumed to take unit time, our algorithms run in time O ( n f −2 log n ), where f is the number of facets of the polyhedron determining the polyhedral norm. Thus for example we have O ( n 2 log n ) algorithms for the cases of points in the plane under the Rectilinear and Sup norms. This is in contrast to the fact that finding a minimum length tour in each case is NP-hard. Supported by an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship and NSF grant DMS 9501129.
