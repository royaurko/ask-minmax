In this paper we propose a cheap yet effective extension to the traditional local improvement algorithm. We present this extension in the context of the Dial-A-Ride Problem, a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem. This extension, which we call sacrificing , yields significant improvements over its plain local improvement counterpart without adversely affecting the algorithm's running time.
