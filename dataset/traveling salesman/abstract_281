The algorithm is derived by applying Benders decomposition to a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the problem. We identify trivial TDTSPs for which a standard implementation of the algorithm requires an exponential number of iterations to converge. This motivates the development of an efficient, network-flow-based method for finding Pareto-optimal dual solutions of a highly degenerate subproblem. Preliminary computational experience demonstrates that the use of these Pareto-optimal solutions has a dramatic impact on the performance of the algorithm. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
