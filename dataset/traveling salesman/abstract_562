For k ≥ 2 we consider a worst-case instance of the Euclidean traveling salesman problem through n points in the unit k -cube [0,1] k . That is, for each n we arrange n points in the k -cube so that the shortest circuit containing them is as long as possible. Such optimum circuits are known to have length asymptotic to as n → ∞, where α k depends only on k and is bounded. We are concerned with the problem of determining α k for small values of k and also the asymptotic behavior of α k as k → ∞. It was shown by Few ( Mathematika 2 (1955), 141–144) that and that for k ≥3, so that, for large k , 0.2419≲ α k ≲0.7071. Later, Moran ( J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 37 (1984), 113–141) improved the upper bound, for large k , to α k ≲0.6136. Few's upper bound is better than Moran's for small values of k . Here, we sharpen each of these upper bounds by a factor of about √2. By generalizing the classic “strip” algorithm used by Few, we obtain where γ k is the mean deviation per dimension of the best quantizer of unit density in . γ k can be roughly defined as follows: Let R be a very large k -dimensional cube with integer volume M , and let z be a uniformly distributed random point in R . Then γ k is the least possible expected value of | z − Q ( z )| 2 , over all functions Q from R onto an M -subset of R ( Q is called a quantizer for R ). Numerically, we have γ 1 = 0.25, and γ k √k → 0.2420 … (not monotonically) as k → ∞. We also review Moran's asymptotic upper bound on α k . By using recent estimates on the maximum sphere-packing density, we improve Moran's argument to give α k ≲0.4051. Again, the latter bound is the better one only when k is large.
