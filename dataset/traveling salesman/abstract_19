  Systematic change of neighborhood within a local search algorithm yields a simple and effective metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization. We present a basic scheme for this purpose which can be implemented easily using any local search algorithm as a subroutine. Its effectiveness is illustrated by improvements in the GENIUS algorithm for the traveling salesman problem [1], without and with backhauls [2]. References 1. M. Gendreau, A. Hertz, G.
