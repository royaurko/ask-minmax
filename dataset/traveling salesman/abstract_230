  Previous literature on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) assumed that the sites to be visited are stationary. Motivated by practical applications, we introduce a time-dependent generalization of TSP which we call Moving-Target TSP, where a pursuer must intercept in minimum time a set of targets which move with constant velocities. We propose approximate and exact algorithms for several natural variants of Moving-Target TSP. Polynomial time approximation schemes for euclidean TSP and other geometric problems Proc. IEEE Symp.
