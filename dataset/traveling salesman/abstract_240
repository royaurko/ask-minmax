This paper introduces the maximum benefit Chinese postman problem (MBCPP) and the maximum benefit traveling salesman problem (MBTSP). For the MBCPP a benefit is realized each time a link of a directed graph is traversed. The MBCPP relaxes the constraint of the Chinese postman problem that each link be traversed.at least once and finds a tour of maximum total net benefit. For the MBTSP a benefit is derived when a node is visited and a cost is incurred when a link is traversed. The MBTSP relaxes the constraint of the traveling salesman problem that each node be visited exactly (or at least) once and finds a tour of maximum total net benefit. Both problems are formulated as linear integer programming problems. A solution algorithm is given that repeatedly solves a relaxation of the formulation as a minimum cost flow problem using a branch-and-bound procedure. Computational examples are presented.
