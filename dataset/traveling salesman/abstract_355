For the traveling salesman problem (TSP) on n nodes, we show that a tour which is better than ω(( n /2)!) alternative tours can be identified in O ( n 3 ) time. Also we provide another algorithm of complexity O n 3 ) which is guaranteed to produce a solution which is better than ω( n /( k +1))!( k !) n /( k +1) alternative tours, whenever k is fixed. Further we show that by using an O ( n 4 ) algorithm, a TSP tour which dominates ω(( n /2)! n ) alternative tours can be identified. We also suggest an O ( n 5 ) algorithm with improved domination number. PDF
