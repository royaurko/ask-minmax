Applications of Evolutionary Computation Evolutionary Computation in Computer Science and Operations Research Volume 1141 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 890-899 Date: 11 July 2005 New genetic local search operators for the traveling salesman problem Bernd Freisleben Affiliated with Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (FB 12), University of Siegen , Peter Merz Affiliated with Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (FB 12), University of Siegen In this paper, an approach is presented to incorporate problem specific knowledge into a genetic algorithm which is used to compute near-optimum solutions to traveling salesman problems (TSP). The approach is based on using a tour construction heuristic for generating the initial population, a tour improvement heuristic for finding local optima in a given TSP search space, and new genetic operators for effectively searching the space of local optima in order to find the global optimum. The quality and efficiency of solutions obtained for a set of TSP instances containing between 318 and 1400 cities are presented.
