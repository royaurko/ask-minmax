  We consider the n -city traveling salesman problem where the distances between the cities are nondeterministic. Our purpose is to estimate the expectation of the length of the optimal tour. This is done by calculating the expectations of a lower bound and an upper bound for the length of the optimal tour. Because the upper bound is formed by the well-known nearest neighbour rule, we can simultaneously find the cases where this rule is effective in the mean. If we let the number of cities grow, we obtain symptotic results that are totally determined by the behaviour of the distribution of the distance between any two points in the neighbourhood of the distance zero.
