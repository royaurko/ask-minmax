  The probabilistic traveling salesman problem (PTSP) is a topic of theoretical and practical importance in the study of stochastic network problems. It provides researchers with a modeling framework for exploring the stochastic effects in routing problems. This paper proposed three initial solution generators (NN1, NN2, RAN) under a genetic algorithm (GA) framework for solving the PTSP. A set of numerical experiments based on heterogeneous and homogeneous PTSP instances were conducted to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. The results from the heterogeneous PTSP show that the average E[τ] E [ τ ] values obtained by the three generators under a GA framework are similar to those obtained by the “Previous Best,” but with an average computation time saving of 50.2%. As for the homogeneous PTSP instances, NN1 is a relatively better generator among the three examined, while RAN consistently performs worse than the other two generators in terms of average E[τ] E [ τ ] values. Additionally, as compared to previously reported studies, no one single algorithm consistently outperformed the others across all homogeneous PTSP instances in terms of the best E[τ] E [ τ ] values. The fact that no one initial solution generator consistently performs best in terms of the E[τ] E [ τ ] value obtained across all instances in heterogeneous cases, and that the performance of each examined algorithm is dependent on the number of nodes ( n ) and probability ( p ) for homogeneous cases, suggest the possibility of context-dependent phenomenon. Finally, to obtain valid results, researchers are advised to include at least a certain amount of test instances with the same combination of n and p when conducting PTSP experiments.

Introduction The probabilistic traveling salesman problem (PTSP) is an extension of the well-known traveling salesman problem (TSP), which has been extensively studied in the field of combinatorial optimization. The goal of the TSP is to find the minimum length of a tour to all customers, given the distances between all pairs of customers, whereas the objective of the PTSP is to minimize the expected length of the a priori tour, where each customer requires a visit only with a given probability [1] , [2]  and  [3] . The main difference between the PTSP and the TSP is that in the PTSP the probability of each node being visited is between 0.0 and 1.0, while in TSP the probability of each node being visited is 1.0. Due to the fact that the element of uncertainty not only exists, but also significantly affects the system performance in many real-world transportation and logistics applications, the results from the PTSP can provide insights into research in other probabilistic combinatorial optimization problems. Moreover, the PTSP can also be used to model many real-world applications in logistical and transportation planning, such as daily pickup-delivery services with stochastic demand, job sequencing involving changeover cost, design of retrieval sequences in a warehouse or in cargo terminal operations, meals on wheels in senior citizen services, trip-chaining activities, vehicle routing problem with stochastic demand, home delivery service under e-commerce, and probabilistic arc-routing problems for small-package local routing [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , [8]  and  [9] . Early PTSP computational studies, dating from 1985, adopted heuristic approaches that were modified from the TSP (e.g., nearest neighbor, savings approach, spacefilling curve, radial sorting, 1-shift, and 2-opt exchanges) [1] , [2] , [3] , [10] , [11] , [12]  and  [13] , but due to the less than satisfactory performance with regard to solution quality, researchers in recent years have turned to metaheuristic methods, such as ant colony optimization [14] , [15] , [16] , [17]  and  [18] , evolutionary algorithms [19] , greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) [20]  and  [21] , honey bees mating optimization [22] , iterative local search algorithms [18] , [23] , [24] , [25]  and  [26] , memetic algorithms [18] , particle swarm optimization [21] , scatter search [27]  and  [28] , simulated annealing [29] and threshold accepting [9] . Since genetic algorithms (GA), using the conceptual framework of the population-based metaheuristic method, have been shown to yield promising outcomes for solving various complicated optimization problems over the past three decades [30] , [31] , [32] , [33]  and  [34] , this study will further investigate the effects of different methods based on random generation and nearest neighbor algorithms for generating initial solutions under a GA framework for solving the PTSP. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithmic procedures, a set of heterogeneous and homogeneous PTSP test instances, as investigated in previous studies, will be used as the basis for comparison. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, expressions for exactly and approximately evaluating the a priori tour for the PTSP are introduced. The details of the proposed algorithmic procedure for the PTSP are then described. The results of the numerical experiments are presented and discussed in the next section, followed by concluding comments.
