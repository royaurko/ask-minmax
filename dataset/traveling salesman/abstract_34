This paper describes efficient algorithms for computing approximate traveling salesman tours in multidimensional point sets. We describe implementations of a dozen starting heuristics (including Nearest Neighbor and Farthest Insertion) and three local optimizations (including 2-Opt and 3-Opt). Experiments indicate that most of the algorithms run in O ( N log N ) time on uniform data sets, and many run almost as fast on very nonuniform data. The program that implements the algorithms is able to solve uniform planar million-city traveling salesman problems to within a few percent of optimal in several midicomputer CPU hours. The algorithms and program apply to many distance metrics and dimensions.
