  In the multiple- asymmetric TSP, a tour's letter rearrangement neighborhood weight is linear in the tourlengths of the tour and its inverse. This reveals that in the multiple- symmetric TSP, no arbitrarily poor local optima exist in such neighborhoods of derangement tours. Keywords TSP ; Symmetric group ; Rearrangement neighborhood 1. F.
