In this paper, we address an n -job, single machine scheduling problem with an objective to minimize the flow time variance. We propose heuristic procedure based on genetic algorithms with the potential to address more generalized objective function such as weighted flow time variance. The development and implementation of the algorithm is supported with literature review and statistical analysis of the results. Some general guidelines to select the parameter values of the genetic algorithm are also developed using an experimental design approach.
