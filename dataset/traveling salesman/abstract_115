The symmetric Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) is a variant of the classical symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem, in which the nodes are partitioned into clusters and the salesman has to visit at least one node for each cluster. A different version of the problem, called E-GTSP, arises when exactly one node for each cluster has to be visited. Both GTSP and E-GTSP are NP -hard problems and find practical applications in routing, scheduling, and location-routing. in this paper, we model GTSP and E-GTSP as integer linear programs and study the facial structure of the corresponding polytopes. in a companion paper, Theresults described in this work have been used to design a branch-and-cut algorithm for the exact solution of instances up to 442 nodes.
