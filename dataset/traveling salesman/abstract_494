A class of semidefinite relaxations of STSP model is defined and two variants of a branch-and-bound technique based on this class of relaxations are proposed. The results of preliminary numerical experiments with randomly generated problems are reported. Keywords Semidefinite programming Traveling salesman problem Branch-and-bound methods
