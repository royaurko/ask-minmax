The path , the wheelbarrow , and the bicycle inequalities have been shown by Cornu√©jols, Fonlupt, and Naddef to be facet-defining for the graphical relaxation of STSP( n ), the polytope of the symmetric traveling salesman problem on an n -node complete graph. We show that these inequalities, and some generalizations of them, define facets also for STSP( n ). In conclusion, we characterize a large family of facet-defining inequalities for STSP( n ) that include, as special cases, most of the inequalities currently known to have this property as the comb , the clique tree , and the chain inequalities. Most of the results given here come from a strong relationship of STSP( n ) with its graphical relaxation that we have pointed out in another paper, where the basic proof techniques are also described.
