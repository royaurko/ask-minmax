Date: 09 June 2005 Exploring self-adaptive methods to improve the efficiency of generating approximate solutions to traveling salesman problems using evolutionary programming Kumar Chellapilla Affiliated with Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Villanova University , David B. Fogel Affiliated with Natural Selection, Inc. Self-adaptation is becoming a standard method for optimizing mutational parameters within evolutionary programming. The majority of these efforts have been applied to continuous optimization problems. This paper offers a preliminary investigation into the use of self-adaptation for discrete optimization using the traveling salesman problem. Two self-adaptive approaches are analyzed. The results indicate that the use of self-adaptation can yield statistically significantly improved solutions over the failure to use any self-adaptation at all. This improvement comes at the expense of greater computational effort.
