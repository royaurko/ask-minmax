  This paper deals with a particular traveling salesman problem in which the cities must be visited on a periodic basis over a given M -day time period. Two heuristic algorithms, embedding a procedure for finding a shortest path on a layered network, are developed. Computational results are also reported for ten test problems drawn from the literature. 1. M. Lucertini, G.
