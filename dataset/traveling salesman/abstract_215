The task of developing daily schedules for a steel rolling mill has been formulated as a Prize Collecting Traveling Salesman (PCTS) Problem, in which a salesman who gets a prize for every city he visits seeks a minimum-cost tour including enough cities to collect a required amount of prize money. This paper addresses the facial structure of the PCTS polytope, the convex hull of solutions to the PCTS problem. In an earlier paper, we generalized to the PCTS polytope the subtour elimination inequalities for the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman (ATS) polytope. Here, we give a general method for deriving a facet defining inequality for the PCTS polytope from any facet defining inequality for the ATS polytope. We apply the procedure to several well-known families of facet inducing inequalities for the ATS polytope: comb, odd CAT, SD, clique tree, and lifted cycle inequalities. We also extend the cloning and clique lifting procedure for the ATS polytope to the PCTS polytope. More content like this Find more content: like this article Find more content written by: Egon Balas
