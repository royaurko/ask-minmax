  Several important types of arc routing problems can be transformed into traveling salesman problems. Computational results indicate that the approach works well on low density graphs containing few edges. Instances involving up to 220 vertices, 660 arcs, and a few edges were solved to optimality. It constitutes the only known approach for solving Mixed Rural Postman Problems and Stacker Crane Problems to optimality. References 1. H.A. Eiselt, M. Gendreau, G.
