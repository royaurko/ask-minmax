The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the hardest optimization problems in NPO because it does not admit any polynomial-time approximation algorithm (unless ). On the other hand we have a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the Euclidean TSP and the 3/2 -approximation algorithm of Christofides for TSP instances satisfying the triangle inequality. In this paper, we consider -TSP, for 1/2<β<1 , as a subproblem of the TSP whose input instances satisfy the β -sharpened triangle inequality cost({u,v})≤β(cost({u,x})+cost({x,v})) for all vertices u , v , x . This problem is APX-complete for every β>1/2 . The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of three different methods for the design of polynomial-time approximation algorithms for -TSP with 1/2<β<1 , where the approximation ratio lies between 1 and 3/2 , depending on β .
