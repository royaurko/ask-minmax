  Bartholdi and Platzman [3] proposed the spacefilling curve heuristic for the Euclidan Traveling Salesman Problem and proved that their heuristic returns a tour within an O(lg n )factor of optimal length. They conjectured that the worst-case ratio is in fact O(1). In this note a counterexample is exhinited showing the O(lg n ) upper bound is tight.
