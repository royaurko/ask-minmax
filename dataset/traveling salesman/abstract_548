We analyze probabilistically the classical Held-Karp lower bound derived from the 1-tree relaxation for the Euclidean traveling salesman problem (ETSP). We prove that, if n points are identically and independently distributed according to a distribution with bounded support and absolutely continuous part f ( x ) dx over the d -cube, the Held-Karp lower bound on these n points is almost surely asymptotic to β HK ( d ) n ( d −1)/ d ∫ f ( x ) ( d −1)/ d dx , where β HK ( d ) is a constant independent of n . The result suggests a probabilistic explanation of the observation that the lower bound is very close to the length of the optimal tour in practice, since the ETSP is almost surely asymptotic to β TSP ( d ) n ( d −1)/ d ∫ f ( x ) ( d −1)/ d dx . The techniques we use exploit the polyhedral description of the Held-Karp lower bound and the theory of subadditive Euclidean functionals.
