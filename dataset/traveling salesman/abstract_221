Volume 12 of the series Combinatorial Optimization pp 609-662 The Generalized Traveling Salesman and Orienteering Problems Matteo Fischetti Affiliated with D.E.I., University of Padova , Juan-José Salazar-Gonzalez Affiliated with D.E.I.O.C., University of La Laguna , Paolo Toth Affiliated with D.E.I.S., University of Bologna Routing and Scheduling problems often require the determination of optimal sequences subject to a given set of constraints. The best known problem of this type is the classical Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), calling for a minimum cost Hamiltonian cycle on a given graph.
