  The traveling salesman problem is expanded to include the situation where a group of cities (cluster) must be visited contiguously in an optimal, unspecified order. Given several sets of clusters within the problem, a method is developed for optimizing simultaneously the ordering of cities within each cluster and the ordering of clusters. A real-world warehousing problem is shown to fit this formulation. References 1. G. Dantzig, R. Fulkerson, S.
