E-mail: gilbert@crt.umontreal.ca Received April 2009; Accepted May 2009. The Traveling Salesman Problem ( TSP ) is one of the most famous problems in combinatorial optimization. Hundreds of papers have been written on the TSP and several exact and heuristic algorithms are available for it. Their concise guide outlines the most important and best algorithms for the symmetric and asymmetric versions of the TSP. In several cases, references to publicly available software are provided.
