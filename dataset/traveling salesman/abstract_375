In this paper, a novel algorithm based on particle optimization algorithm (PSO) and chaos optimization algorithm (COA) is presented to solve traveling salesman problem. Some new operators are proposed to overcome the difficulties of implementing PSO into solving the discreet problems. Meanwhile embedded with chaos optimization algorithm (COA) it can enhance particle's global searching ability so as not to converge to the local optimal solutions too quickly. The experiment results of several benchmark test problems show its validity and satisfactory effect.
