We propose a paradigm for concurrent natural language generation. In order to
represent grammar rules distributively, we adopt categorial unification grammar
(CUG) where each category owns its functional type. We augment typed lambda
calculus with several new combinators, to make the order of lambda-conversions
free for partial / local processing. The concurrent calculus is modeled with
Chemical Abstract Machine. We show an example of a Japanese causative auxiliary
verb that requires a drastic rearrangement of case domination.
