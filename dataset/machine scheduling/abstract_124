Algorithms based on semi-partitioned scheduling have been proposed as a
viable alternative between the two extreme ones based on global and partitioned
scheduling. In particular, allowing migration to occur only for few tasks which
cannot be assigned to any individual processor, while most tasks are assigned
to specific processors, considerably reduces the runtime overhead compared to
global scheduling on the one hand, and improve both the schedulability and the
system utilization factor compared to partitioned scheduling on the other hand.
In this paper, we address the preemptive scheduling problem of hard real-time
systems composed of sporadic constrained-deadline tasks upon identical
multiprocessor platforms. We propose a new algorithm and a scheduling paradigm
based on the concept of semi-partitioned scheduling with restricted migrations
in which jobs are not allowed to migrate, but two subsequent jobs of a task can
be assigned to different processors by following a periodic strategy.
