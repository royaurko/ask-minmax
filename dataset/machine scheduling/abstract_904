Before the operation of a motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI)
adopting machine learning techniques, a cumbersome training procedure is
unavoidable. The development of a practical BCI posed the challenge of
classifying single-trial EEG with a small training set. In this letter, we
addressed this problem by employing a series of signal processing and machine
learning approaches to alleviate overfitting and obtained test accuracy similar
to training accuracy on the datasets from BCI Competition III and our own
experiments.
