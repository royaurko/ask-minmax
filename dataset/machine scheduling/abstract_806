An intensive use of reconfigurable hardware is expected in future embedded
systems. This means that the system has to decide which tasks are more suitable
for hardware execution. In order to make an efficient use of the FPGA it is
convenient to choose one that allows hardware multitasking, which is
implemented by using partial dynamic reconfiguration. One of the challenges for
hardware multitasking in embedded systems is the online management of the only
reconfiguration port of present FPGA devices. This paper presents different
online reconfiguration scheduling strategies which assign the reconfiguration
interface resource using different criteria: workload distribution or task
deadline. The online scheduling strategies presented take efficient and fast
decisions based on the information available at each moment. Experiments have
been made in order to analyze the performance and convenience of these
reconfiguration strategies.
