Predictive models are often used for real-time decision making. However,
typical machine learning techniques ignore feature evaluation cost, and focus
solely on the accuracy of the machine learning models obtained utilizing all
the features available. We develop algorithms and indexes to support
cost-sensitive prediction, i.e., making decisions using machine learning models
taking feature evaluation cost into account. Given an item and a online
computation cost (i.e., time) budget, we present two approaches to return an
appropriately chosen machine learning model that will run within the specified
time on the given item. The first approach returns the optimal machine learning
model, i.e., one with the highest accuracy, that runs within the specified
time, but requires significant up-front precomputation time. The second
approach returns a possibly sub- optimal machine learning model, but requires
little up-front precomputation time. We study these two algorithms in detail
and characterize the scenarios (using real and synthetic data) in which each
performs well. Unlike prior work that focuses on a narrow domain or a specific
algorithm, our techniques are very general: they apply to any cost-sensitive
prediction scenario on any machine learning algorithm.
