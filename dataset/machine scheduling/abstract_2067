The prescription of Silva to derive superpotential equations from variational
derivatives rather than from Lagrangian densities is applied to theories of
gravity derived from Lovelock Lagrangians in the Palatini representation.
Spacetimes are without torsion and isolated sources of gravity are minimally
coupled. On a closed boundary of spacetime, the metric is given and the
connection coefficients are those of Christoffel. We derive equations for the
superpotentials in these conditions. The equations are easily integrated and we
give the general expression for all superpotentials associated with Lovelock
Lagrangians. We find, in particular, that in Einstein's theory, in any number
of dimensions, the superpotential, valid at spatial and at null infinity, is
that of Katz, Bicak and Lynden-Bell, the KBL superpotential. We also give
explicitly the superpotential for Gauss-Bonnet theories of gravity. Finally, we
find a simple expression for the superpotential of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
theories with an anti-de Sitter background: it is minus the KBL superpotential,
confirming, as it should, the calculation of the total mass-energy of spacetime
at spatial infinity by Deser and Tekin.
