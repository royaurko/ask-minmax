In this paper we consider the problem of scheduling jobs on parallel
identical machines, where the processing times of jobs are uncertain: only
interval bounds of processing times are known. The optimality criterion of a
schedule is the total completion time. In order to cope with the uncertainty we
consider the maximum regret objective and we seek a schedule which performs
well under all possible instantiations of processing times. Although the
deterministic version of the considered problem is solvable in polynomial time,
the minmax regret version is known to be weakly NP-hard even for a single
machine, and strongly NP-hard for parallel unrelated machines. In this paper we
show that the problem is strongly NP-hard also in the case of parallel
identical machines.
