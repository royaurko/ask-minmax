The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) is scheduled to be launched as a
part of the ASTROSAT satellite. As part of the mission planning for the
instrument we have studied the efficacy of UVIT observations for interstellar
extinction measurements. We find that in the best case scenario, the UVIT can
measure the reddening to an accuracy of about 0.02 magnitudes, which combined
with the derived distances to the stars, will enable us to model the
three-dimensional distribution of extinction in our Galaxy. The knowledge of
the distribution of the ISM will then be used to study distant objects,
affected by it. This work points the way to further refining the UVIT mission
plan to best satisfy different science studies.
