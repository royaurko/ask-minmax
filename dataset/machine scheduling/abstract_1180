We explore asynchronous unison in the presence of systemic transient and
permanent Byzantine faults in shared memory. We observe that the problem is not
solvable under less than strongly fair scheduler or for system topologies with
maximum node degree greater than two. We present a self-stabilizing
Byzantine-tolerant solution to asynchronous unison for chain and ring
topologies. Our algorithm has minimum possible containment radius and optimal
stabilization time.
