A queue is required when a service provider is not able to handle jobs
arriving over the time. In a highly flexible and dynamic environment, some jobs
might demand for faster execution at run-time especially when the resources are
limited and the jobs are competing for acquiring resources. A user might demand
for speed up (reduced wait time) for some of the jobs present in the queue at
run time. In such cases, it is required to accelerate (directly sending the job
to the server) urgent jobs (requesting for speed up) ahead of other jobs
present in the queue for an earlier completion of urgent jobs. Under the
assumption of no additional resources, such acceleration of jobs would result
in slowing down of other jobs present in the queue. In this paper, we formulate
the problem of Speed Up Scheduling without acquiring any additional resources
for the scheduling of on-line speed up requests posed by a user at run-time and
present algorithms for the same. We apply the idea of Speed Up Scheduling to
two different domains -Web Scheduling and CPU Scheduling. We demonstrate our
results with a simulation based model using trace driven workload and synthetic
datasets to show the usefulness of Speed Up scheduling. Speed Up provides a new
way of addressing urgent jobs, provides a different evaluation criteria for
comparing scheduling algorithms and has practical applications.
