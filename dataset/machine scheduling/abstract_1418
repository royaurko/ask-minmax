An algorithm is presented which implements a probabilistic attack on the
key-exchange protocol based on permutation parity machines. Instead of
imitating the synchronization of the communicating partners, the strategy
consists of a Monte Carlo method to sample the space of possible weights during
inner rounds and an analytic approach to convey the extracted information from
one outer round to the next one. The results show that the protocol under
attack fails to synchronize faster than an eavesdropper using this algorithm.
