We introduce a Deep Boltzmann Machine model suitable for modeling and
extracting latent semantic representations from a large unstructured collection
of documents. We overcome the apparent difficulty of training a DBM with
judicious parameter tying. This parameter tying enables an efficient
pretraining algorithm and a state initialization scheme that aids inference.
The model can be trained just as efficiently as a standard Restricted Boltzmann
Machine. Our experiments show that the model assigns better log probability to
unseen data than the Replicated Softmax model. Features extracted from our
model outperform LDA, Replicated Softmax, and DocNADE models on document
retrieval and document classification tasks.
