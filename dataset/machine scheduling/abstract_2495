This paper presents the current state of an ongoing research project to
improve the performance of the OCaml byte-code interpreter using Just-In-Time
native code generation. Our JIT engine OCamlJIT2 currently runs on x86-64
processors, mimicing precisely the behavior of the OCaml virtual machine. Its
design and implementation is described, and performance measures are given.
