Groupon has become the latest Internet sensation, providing daily deals to
customers in the form of discount offers for restaurants, ticketed events,
appliances, services, and other items. We undertake a study of the economics of
daily deals on the web, based on a dataset we compiled by monitoring Groupon
over several weeks. We use our dataset to characterize Groupon deal purchases,
and to glean insights about Groupon's operational strategy. Our focus is on
purchase incentives. For the primary purchase incentive, price, our regression
model indicates that demand for coupons is relatively inelastic, allowing room
for price-based revenue optimization. More interestingly, mining our dataset,
we find evidence that Groupon customers are sensitive to other, "soft",
incentives, e.g., deal scheduling and duration, deal featuring, and limited
inventory. Our analysis points to the importance of considering incentives
other than price in optimizing deal sites and similar systems.
