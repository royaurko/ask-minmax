Radiotherapy represents an important phase of treatment for a large number of
cancer patients. It is essential that resources used to deliver this treatment
are employed effectively. This paper presents a new integer linear programming
model for real-world radiotherapy treatment scheduling and analyses the
effectiveness of using this model on a daily basis in a hospital. Experiments
are conducted varying the days on which schedules can be created. Results
obtained using real-world data from the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS
Trust, UK, are presented and show how the proposed model can be used with
different policies in order to achieve good quality schedules.
