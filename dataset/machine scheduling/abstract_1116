We have built a line list in the near-infrared J and H bands (1.00-1.34,
1.49-1.80 um) by gathering a series of laboratory and computed line lists.
Oscillator strengths and damping constants were computed or obtained by fitting
the solar spectrum.
  The line list presented in this paper is, to our knowledge, the most complete
one now available, and supersedes previous lists.
