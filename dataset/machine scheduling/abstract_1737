A general decentralized computational framework for set-valued state
estimation and prediction for the class of systems that accept a hybrid state
machine representation is considered in this article. The decentralized scheme
consists of a conjunction of distributed state machines that are specified by a
decomposition of the external signal space. While this is shown to produce, in
general, outer approximations of the outcomes of the original monolithic state
machine, here, specific rules for the signal space decomposition are devised by
utilizing structural properties of the underyling transition relation, leading
to a recovery of the exact state set results. By applying a suitable
approximation algorithm, we show that computational complexity in the
decentralized setting may thereby essentially reduce as compared to the
centralized estimation scheme.
