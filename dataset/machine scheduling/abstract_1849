Attacks on host computers by malicious peripherals are a growing problem; the
inexorable advance of powerful, small, cheap peripherals, which attach to
plug-and-play buses, has made such attacks easy to mount. At the same time,
commodity operating systems lack systematic defenses.
  We present Cinch, a pragmatic response to this threat. Cinch transforms USB
peripherals to untrusted network endpoints, thereby allowing users and
administrators to deploy a rich, existing toolbox from network security
(firewalls, VPNs, DPIs, etc.) to defend the computer in a systematic way. Cinch
uses virtualization technology to place the hardware in a logically separate
and untrusted machine, and includes an interposition layer between the
untrusted machine and the protected one. This layer accepts or rejects
interaction with devices and enforces strict standards-compliant behavior,
presenting to the protected machine the abstraction of "well-behaved"
peripherals. We show that Cinch can be easily implemented on existing operating
systems, concisely expresses policies that thwart many real-world attacks, and
has low overhead.
