Several processes can cause the shape of an extrasolar giant planet's shadow,
as viewed in transit, to depart from circular. In addition to rotational
effects, cloud formation, non-homogenous haze production and movement, and
dynamical effects (winds) could also be important. When such a planet transits
its host star as seen from Earth, the asphericity will introduce a deviation in
the transit lightcurve relative to the transit of a perfectly spherical (or
perfectly oblate) planet. We develop a theoretical framework to interpret
planet shapes. We then generate predictions for transiting planet shapes based
on a published theoretical dynamical model of HD189733b. Using these shape
models we show that planet shapes are unlikely to introduce detectable
lightcurve deviations (those >~1e-5 of the host star), but that the shapes may
lead to astrophysical sources of systematic error when measuring planetary
oblateness, transit time, and impact parameter.
