In this paper, we present a new approach to the semantic enrichment of
mathematical expression problem. Our approach is a combination of statistical
machine translation and disambiguation which makes use of surrounding text of
the mathematical expressions. We first use Support Vector Machine classifier to
disambiguate mathematical terms using both their presentation form and
surrounding text. We then use the disambiguation result to enhance the semantic
enrichment of a statistical-machine-translation-based system. Experimental
results show that our system archives improvements over prior systems.
