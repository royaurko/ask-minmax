Tremendous research effort was invested in audio browsers and machine
learning techniques to decode the structure of Web pages in order to put them
into an audio format. In this paper, we address a simpler and efficient
solution for the creation of an audio browser of VOICEXML generated from
RSS/Atom stream feeds. We developed a multimodal (audio and graphical) portal
application that offers RSS/Atom feeds. By utilizing sing our system, the user
can interact using voice or graphic commands, listen and watch digital content,
such as news, blogs feeds, podcasts, and even access email and personal
schedules. The portal system permits the use of security credentials
(user/password authentication) to collect secure RSS/Atom stream in the
multimodal browser to connect the user to specific personal services. A series
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the RSS reader
and navigator. Our system is extremely beneficial for a wide range of
applications, from interfaces for the visual impaired users to browsers for
mobile telephonic interfaces.
