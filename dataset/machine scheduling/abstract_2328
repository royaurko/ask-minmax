Today's monolithic kernels often implement a small, fixed set of policies
such as disk I/O scheduling policies, while exposing many parameters to let
users select a policy or adjust the specific setting of the policy. Ideally,
the parameters exposed should be flexible enough for users to tune for good
performance, but in practice, users lack domain knowledge of the parameters and
are often stuck with bad, default parameter settings.
  We present EOS, a system that bridges the knowledge gap between kernel
developers and users by automatically evolving the policies and parameters in
vivo on users' real, production workloads. It provides a simple policy
specification API for kernel developers to programmatically describe how the
policies and parameters should be tuned, a policy cache to make in-vivo tuning
easy and fast by memorizing good parameter settings for past workloads, and a
hierarchical search engine to effectively search the parameter space.
Evaluation of EOS on four main Linux subsystems shows that it is easy to use
and effectively improves each subsystem's performance.
