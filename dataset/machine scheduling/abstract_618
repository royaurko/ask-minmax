A concept of randomness for infinite time register machines (ITRMs),
resembling Martin-L\"of-randomness, is defined and studied. In particular, we
show that for this notion of randomness, computability from mutually random
reals implies computability and that an analogue of van Lambalgen's theorem
holds.
