This article considers the joint problem of packet scheduling and
self-localization in an underwater acoustic sensor network where sensor nodes
are distributed randomly in an operating area. In terms of packet scheduling,
our goal is to minimize the localization time, and to do so we consider two
packet transmission schemes, namely a collision-free scheme (CFS), and a
collision-tolerant scheme (CTS). The required localization time is formulated
for these schemes, and through analytical results and numerical examples their
performances are shown to be generally comparable. However, when the packet
duration is short (as is the case for a localization packet), and the operating
area is large (above 3km in at least one dimension), the collision-tolerant
scheme requires a smaller localization time than the collision-free scheme.
After gathering enough measurements, an iterative Gauss-Newton algorithm is
employed by each sensor node for self-localization, and the Cramer Rao lower
bound is evaluated as a benchmark. Although CTS consumes more energy for packet
transmission, it provides a better localization accuracy. Additionally, in this
scheme the anchor nodes work independently of each other, and can operate
asynchronously which leads to a simplified implementation.
