Handheld devices, while growing rapidly, are inherently constrained and lack
the capability of executing resource hungry applications. This paper presents
the design and implementation of distributed analysis and load-balancing system
for hand-held devices using multi-agents system. This system enables low
resource mobile handheld devices to act as potential clients for Grid enabled
applications and analysis environments. We propose a system, in which mobile
agents will transport, schedule, execute and return results for heavy
computational jobs submitted by handheld devices. Moreover, in this way, our
system provides high throughput computing environment for hand-held devices.
