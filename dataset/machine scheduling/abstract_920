Explosive growth in data and availability of cheap computing resources have
sparked increasing interest in Big learning, an emerging subfield that studies
scalable machine learning algorithms, systems, and applications with Big Data.
Bayesian methods represent one important class of statistic methods for machine
learning, with substantial recent developments on adaptive, flexible and
scalable Bayesian learning. This article provides a survey of the recent
advances in Big learning with Bayesian methods, termed Big Bayesian Learning,
including nonparametric Bayesian methods for adaptively inferring model
complexity, regularized Bayesian inference for improving the flexibility via
posterior regularization, and scalable algorithms and systems based on
stochastic subsampling and distributed computing for dealing with large-scale
applications.
