In this paper, we provide an energy efficient self- healing mechanism for
Wireless Sensor Networks. The proposed solution is based on our probabilistic
sentinel scheme. To reduce energy consumption while maintaining good
connectivity between sentinel nodes, we compose our solution on two main
concepts, node adaptation and link adaptation. The first algorithm uses node
adaptation technique and permits to distributively schedule nodes activities
and select a minimum subset of active nodes (sentry) to monitor the interest
region. And secondly, we in- troduce a link control algorithm to ensure better
connectiv- ity between sentinel nodes while avoiding outliers appearance.
Without increasing control messages overhead, performances evaluations show
that our solution is scalable with a steady energy consumption. Simulations
carried out also show that the proposed mechanism ensures good connectivity
between sentry nodes while considerably reducing the total energy spent.
