Nowadays, manufacturing industries -- driven by fierce competition and rising
customer requirements -- are forced to produce a broader range of individual
products of rising quality at the same (or preferably lower) cost. Meeting
these demands implies an even more complex production process and thus also an
appropriately increasing request to its scheduling. Aggravatingly, vagueness of
scheduling parameters -- such as times and conditions -- are often inherent in
the production process. In addition, the search for an optimal schedule
normally leads to very difficult problems (NP-hard problems in the complexity
theoretical sense), which cannot be solved effciently. With the intent to
minimize these problems, the introduced heuristic method combines standard
scheduling methods with fuzzy methods to get a nearly optimal schedule within
an appropriate time considering vagueness adequately.
