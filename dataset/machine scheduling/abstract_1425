We present a novel clustering approach for moving object trajectories that
are constrained by an underlying road network. The approach builds a similarity
graph based on these trajectories then uses modularity-optimization hiearchical
graph clustering to regroup trajectories with similar profiles. Our
experimental study shows the superiority of the proposed approach over classic
hierarchical clustering and gives a brief insight to visualization of the
clustering results.
