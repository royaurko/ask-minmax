We study assignment games in which jobs select machines, and in which certain
pairs of jobs may conflict, which is to say they may incur an additional cost
when they are both assigned to the same machine, beyond that associated with
the increase in load. Questions regarding such interactions apply beyond
allocating jobs to machines: when people in a social network choose to align
themselves with a group or party, they typically do so based upon not only the
inherent quality of that group, but also who amongst their friends (or enemies)
choose that group as well. We show how semi-smoothness, a recently introduced
generalization of smoothness, is necessary to find tight or near-tight bounds
on the price of total anarchy, and thus on the quality of correlated and Nash
equilibria, for several natural job-assignment games with interacting jobs. For
most cases, our bounds on the price of total anarchy are either exactly 2 or
approach 2. We also prove new convergence results implied by semi-smoothness
for our games. Finally we consider coalitional deviations, and prove results
about the existence and quality of Strong equilibrium.
