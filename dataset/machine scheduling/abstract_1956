The Galactic diffuse emission is potentially able to reveal much about the
sources and propagation of cosmic rays (CR), their spectra and intensities in
distant locations. It can possibly unveil WIMP dark matter (DM) through its
annihilation signatures. The extragalactic background may provide vital
information about the early stages of the universe, neutralino annihilation,
and unresolved sources (blazars?) and their cosmological evolution. The
gamma-ray instrument EGRET on the CGRO contributed much to the exploration of
the Galactic diffuse emission. The new NASA Gamma-ray Large Area Space
Telescope (GLAST) is scheduled for launch in 2007; study of the diffuse
gamma-ray emission is one of the priority goals. We describe current
understanding of the diffuse emission and its potential for future discoveries.
