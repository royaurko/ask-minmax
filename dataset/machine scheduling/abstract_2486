We give a general constructive proof for hierarchical coordinatizations
(Lagrange Decompositions) of permutation groups. The generalization originates
from the investigation of how the subgroup chains of finite permutation groups
yield different coordinate systems. The study is motivated by the practical
needs and the verification of an existing computational implementation. Large
scale machine calculated examples are also presented.
