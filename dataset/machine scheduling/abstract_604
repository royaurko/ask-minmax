We introduce the hyperparameter search problem in the field of machine
learning and discuss its main challenges from an optimization perspective.
Machine learning methods attempt to build models that capture some element of
interest based on given data. Most common learning algorithms feature a set of
hyperparameters that must be determined before training commences. The choice
of hyperparameters can significantly affect the resulting model's performance,
but determining good values can be complex; hence a disciplined, theoretically
sound search strategy is essential.
