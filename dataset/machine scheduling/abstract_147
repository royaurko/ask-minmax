Due to the emergence of highly dynamic multimedia applications there is a
need for flexible platforms and run-time scheduling support for embedded
systems. Dynamic Reconfigurable Hardware (DRHW) is a promising candidate to
provide this flexibility but, currently, not sufficient run-time scheduling
support to deal with the run-time reconfigurations exists. Moreover, executing
at run-time a complex scheduling heuristic to provide this support may generate
an excessive run-time penalty. Hence, we have developed a hybrid
design/run-time prefetch heuristic that schedules the reconfigurations at
run-time, but carries out the scheduling computations at design-time by
carefully identifying a set of near-optimal schedules that can be selected at
run-time. This approach provides run-time flexibility with a negligible
penalty.
