Snowmass is a US long-term planning study for the high-energy community by
the American Physical Society's Division of Particles and Fields. For its
simulation studies, opportunistic resources are harnessed using the Open
Science Grid infrastructure. Late binding grid technology, GlideinWMS, was used
for distributed scheduling of the simulation jobs across many sites mainly in
the US. The pilot infrastructure also uses the Parrot mechanism to dynamically
access CvmFS in order to ascertain a homogeneous environment across the nodes.
This report presents the resource usage and the storage model used for
simulating large statistics Standard Model backgrounds needed for Snowmass
Energy Frontier studies.
