Based on an agent based model of opinion changes, described in detail in a
recent paper (\arXiv:1507.00126), we attempt to predict, three months in
advance, the range of possible results of the Polish parliamentary elections,
scheduled for October 25, 2015. The model reproduces semi-quantitatively the
poll results for the three parties which dominated the recent presidential
elections and allows estimation of some variations of the electoral propaganda
campaigns by the parties.
