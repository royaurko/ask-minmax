Response time is one of the characteristics of scheduler, happens to be a
prominent attribute of any CPU scheduling algorithm. The proposed New Multi
Level Feedback Queue [NMLFQ] Scheduler is compared with dynamic, real time,
Dependent Activity Scheduling Algorithm (DASA) and Lockes Best Effort
Scheduling Algorithm (LBESA). We abbreviated beneficial result of NMLFQ
scheduler in comparison with dynamic best effort schedulers with respect to
response time.
