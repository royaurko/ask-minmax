This paper presents deductive programming for scheduling scenario generation.
Modeling for solution is achieved through program transformations. First,
declarative model for scheduling problem domain is introduced. After that model
is interpreted as scheduling domain language and as predicate transition Petri
net. Generated reachability tree presents search space with solutions. At the
end results are discussed and analyzed.
