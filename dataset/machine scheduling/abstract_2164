INTEGRAL played a key role in discovering obscured sgHMXB in the Galaxy. We
used XMM-Newton to perform X-ray wind tomography of a specific of these
systems, IGR J17252-3616, featuring eclipses of the accreting pulsar. The X-ray
band (0.2-10 keV) reveals vital information on the geometry of the surrounding
gas probing simultaneously the absorption and the fluorescence emission. The
XMM observations were scheduled to cover as many orbital phases as possible.
Timing analysis allows the derivation of an accurate orbital solution and of
the system parameters. Spectral analysis revealed remarkable variations of the
absorbing column density along the orbit and of the Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence
line around the eclipse. The combination of these observables revealed a highly
asymmetric and unprecedentedly extended structure in the stellar wind extending
up to 2-3 stellar radii. The observations can be modeled in terms of three
independent components: i) the unperturbed stellar wind ii) the contribution of
a highly asymmetric hydrodynamic wind tail-like structure and iii) a cusp of
material close to the neutron star. These dynamical structures are imaged for
the first time in a sgHMXB and explain the source of the high obscuration.
