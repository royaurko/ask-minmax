Many sources of errors exist in the manufacturing process of complex shapes.
Some approximations occur at each step from the design geometry to the machined
part. The aim of the paper is to present a method to evaluate the effect of
high speed and high dynamic load on volumetric errors at the tool center point.
The interpolator output signals and the machine encoder signals are recorded
and compared to evaluate the contouring errors resulting from each axis
follow-up error. The machine encoder signals are also compared to the actual
tool center point position as recorded with a non-contact measuring instrument
called CapBall to evaluate the total geometric errors. The novelty of the work
lies in the method that is proposed to decompose the geometric errors in two
categories: the quasi-static geometric errors independent from the speed of the
trajectory and the dynamic geometric errors, dependent on the programmed feed
rate and resulting from the machine structure deflection during the
acceleration of its axes. The evolution of the respective contributions for
contouring errors, quasi-static geometric errors and dynamic geomet- ric errors
is experimentally evaluated and a relation between programmed feed rate and
dynamic errors is highlighted.
