Continuous availability of HPC systems built from commodity components have
become a primary concern as system size grows to thousands of processors. In
this paper, we present the analysis of 8-24 months of real failure data
collected from three HPC systems at the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) during 2001-2004. The results show that the availability is
98.7-99.8% and most outages are due to software halts. On the other hand, the
downtime are mostly contributed by hardware halts or scheduled maintenance. We
also used failure clustering analysis to identify several correlated failures.
