Arguments for and against the widely accepted picture of a solar dynamo being
seated in the tachocline are reviewed and alternative ideas concerning dynamos
operating in the bulk of the convection zone, or perhaps even in the
near-surface shear layer, are discussed. Based on the angular velocities of
magnetic tracers it is argued that the observations are compatible with a
distributed dynamo that may be strongly shaped by the near-surface shear layer.
Direct simulations of dynamo action in a slab with turbulence and shear are
presented to discuss filling factor and tilt angles of bipolar regions in such
a model.
