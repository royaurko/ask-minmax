The SSSV model is a simple classical model that achieves excellent
correlation with published experimental data on the D-Wave machine's behavior
on random instances of its native problem, thus raising questions about how
"quantum" the D-Wave machine is at large scales. In response, a recent preprint
by Vinci et al. proposes a particular set of instances on which the D-Wave
machine behaves differently from the SSSV model. In this short note, we explain
how a simple modeling of systematic errors in the machine allows the SSSV model
to reproduce the behavior reported in the experiments of Vinci et al.
