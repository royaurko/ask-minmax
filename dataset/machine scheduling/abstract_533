Scheduling wireless links for simultaneous activation in such a way that all
transmissions are successfully decoded at the receivers and moreover network
capacity is maximized is a computationally hard problem. Usually it is tackled
by heuristics whose output is a sequence of time slots in which every link
appears in exactly one time slot. Such approaches can be interpreted as the
coloring of a graph's vertices so that every vertex gets exactly one color.
Here we introduce a new approach that can be viewed as assigning multiple
colors to each vertex, so that, in the resulting schedule, every link may
appear more than once (though the same number of times for all links). We
report on extensive computational experiments, under the physical interference
model, revealing substantial gains for a variety of randomly generated
networks.
