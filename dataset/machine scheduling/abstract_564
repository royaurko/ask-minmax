Usage of scanning coordinate-measuring machines for inspection of screw
threads has become a common practice nowadays. Compared to touch trigger
probing, scanning capabilities allow to speed up measuring process while still
maintaining high accuracy. However, in some cases accuracy drasticaly depends
on the scanning speed. In this paper a compensation method is proposed allowing
to reduce the influence of some dynamic effects while scanning screw threads on
coordinate-measuring machines.
