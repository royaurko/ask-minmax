In marketing products with negative externalities, a schedule which specifies
an order of consumer purchase decisions is crucial, since in the social network
of consumers, the decision of each consumer is negatively affected by the
choices of her neighbors. In this paper, we study the problems of finding a
marketing schedule for two asymmetric products with negative externalites. The
goals are two-fold: maximizing the sale of one product and ensuring regret-free
purchase decisions. We show that the maximization is NP-hard, and provide
efficient algorithms with satisfactory performance guarantees. Two of these
algorithms give regret-proof schedules, i.e. they reach Nash equilibria where
no consumers regret their previous decisions. Our work is the first attempt to
address these marketing problems from an algorithmic point of view.
