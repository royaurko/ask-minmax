The Tevatron in Collider Run II (2001-present) is operating with six times
more bunches and many times higher beam intensities and luminosities than in
Run I (1992-1995). Beam diagnostics were crucial for the machine start-up and
the never-ending luminosity upgrade campaign. We present the overall picture of
the Tevatron diagnostics development for Run II, outline machine needs for new
instrumentation, present several notable examples that led to Tevatron
performance improvements, and discuss the lessons for future colliders.
