Opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes have been proposed
previously by the contributors for reduced-feedback MIMO-OFDMA downlink systems
where the MIMO channel of each subcarrier is decomposed into layered spatial
subchannels. It has been demonstrated that significant feedback reduction can
be achieved by returning information about only one beamforming matrix (BFM)
for all subcarriers from each MT, compared to one BFM for each subcarrier in
the conventional schemes. However, since the previously proposed channel
decomposition was derived based on singular value decomposition, the resulting
system performance is impaired by the subchannels associated with the smallest
singular values. To circumvent this obstacle, this work proposes improved
opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes based on geometric mean
decomposition-based channel decomposition. In addition to the inherent
advantage in reduced feedback, the proposed schemes can achieve improved system
performance by decomposing the MIMO channels into spatial subchannels with more
evenly distributed channel gains. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes.
