We consider Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes (OU-processes) associated to
hypoelliptic diffusion processes on finite-dimensional Lie groups: let $
\mathcal{L} $ be a hypoelliptic, left-invariant ``sum of the squares''-operator
on a Lie group $ G $ with associated Markov process $ X $, then we construct
OU-processes by adding negative horizontal gradient drifts of functions $ U $.
In the natural case $ U(x) = - \log p(1,x) $, where $ p(1,x) $ is the density
of the law of $ X $ starting at identity $ e $ at time $ t =1 $ with respect to
the right-invariant Haar measure on $G$, we show the Poincar\'e inequality by
applying the Driver-Melcher inequality for ``sum of the squares'' operators on
Lie groups. The resulting Markov process is called the natural OU-process
associated to the hypoelliptic diffusion on $ G $.
  We prove the global strong existence of these OU-type processes on $ G $
under an integrability assumption on $U$. The Poincar\'e inequality for a large
class of potentials $U$ is then shown by a perturbation technique. These
results are applied to obtain a hypoelliptic equivalent of standard results on
cooling schedules for simulated annealing on compact homogeneous spaces $M$.
