Scikit-learn is an increasingly popular machine learning li- brary. Written
in Python, it is designed to be simple and efficient, accessible to
non-experts, and reusable in various contexts. In this paper, we present and
discuss our design choices for the application programming interface (API) of
the project. In particular, we describe the simple and elegant interface shared
by all learning and processing units in the library and then discuss its
advantages in terms of composition and reusability. The paper also comments on
implementation details specific to the Python ecosystem and analyzes obstacles
faced by users and developers of the library.
