Ordinal data is omnipresent in almost all multiuser-generated feedback -
questionnaires, preferences etc. This paper investigates modelling of ordinal
data with Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). In particular, we
present the model architecture, learning and inference procedures for both
vector-variate and matrix-variate ordinal data. We show that our model is able
to capture latent opinion profile of citizens around the world, and is
competitive against state-of-art collaborative filtering techniques on
large-scale public datasets. The model thus has the potential to extend
application of RBMs to diverse domains such as recommendation systems, product
reviews and expert assessments.
