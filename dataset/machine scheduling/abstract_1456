This paper proposes a new robust regression interpretation of sparse
penalties such as the elastic net and the group-lasso. Beyond providing a new
viewpoint on these penalization schemes, our approach results in a unified
optimization strategy. Our evaluation experiments demonstrate that this
strategy, implemented on the elastic net, is computationally extremely
efficient for small to medium size problems. Our accompanying software solves
problems at machine precision in the time required to get a rough estimate with
competing state-of-the-art algorithms.
