Atmospheric neutrinos produced by cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere
are of interest for several reasons. As a beam for studies of neutrino
oscillations they cover a range of parameter space hitherto unexplored by
accelerator neutrino beams. The atmospheric neutrinos also constitute an
important background and calibration beam for neutrino astronomy and for the
search for proton decay and other rare processes. Here we review the literature
on calculations of atmospheric neutrinos over the full range of energy, but
with particular attention to the aspects important for neutrino oscillations.
Our goal is to assess how well the properties of atmospheric neutrinos are
known at present.
