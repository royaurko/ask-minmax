We present a layered Boltzmann machine (BM) that can better exploit the
advantages of a distributed representation. It is widely believed that deep BMs
(DBMs) have far greater representational power than its shallow counterpart,
restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). However, this expectation on the
supremacy of DBMs over RBMs has not ever been validated in a theoretical
fashion. In this paper, we provide both theoretical and empirical evidences
that the representational power of DBMs can be actually rather limited in
taking advantages of distributed representations. We propose an approximate
measure for the representational power of a BM regarding to the efficiency of a
distributed representation. With this measure, we show a surprising fact that
DBMs can make inefficient use of distributed representations. Based on these
observations, we propose an alternative BM architecture, which we dub soft-deep
BMs (sDBMs). We show that sDBMs can more efficiently exploit the distributed
representations in terms of the measure. Experiments demonstrate that sDBMs
outperform several state-of-the-art models, including DBMs, in generative tasks
on binarized MNIST and Caltech-101 silhouettes.
