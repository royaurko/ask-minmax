In a recent article we described a new type of deep neural network - a
Perpetual Learning Machine (PLM) - which is capable of learning 'on the fly'
like a brain by existing in a state of Perpetual Stochastic Gradient Descent
(PSGD). Here, by simulating the process of practice, we demonstrate both
selective memory and selective forgetting when we introduce statistical recall
biases during PSGD. Frequently recalled memories are remembered, whilst
memories recalled rarely are forgotten. This results in a 'use it or lose it'
stimulus driven memory process that is similar to human memory.
