Over a past few decades, VM's or Virtual machines have sort of gained a lot
of momentum, especially for large scale enterprises where the need for resource
optimization & power save is humongous, without compromising with performance
or quality. They are a perfect environment to experiment with new
applications/technologies in a completely secure and closed environment. This
paper discusses how the VM technology can be leveraged to solve day to day
requirement of an odd hundreds or thousands of people, organization-wide, with
new computational resources using a cluster of heterogeneous low or high-end
machines, independent of underlying OS, thereby maximizing resource
utilization. It takes into account both opensource (like VirtualBox) & other
proprietary technologies (like VMWare Workstations) available till date to
propose a viable solution using cloud computing concept. The ease of
scalability to multiple folds for optimizing performance & catering to an even
larger set are some of the salient features of this approach. Using the
snapshot feature, the state of any VM instance could be saved & served back
again on request. Now, this implementation is also served by VMWare ESX server
but again it's a costly solution & requires dedicated high-end machines to work
with.
