I investigate the sensitivity of future hadron colliders to di-jet resonances
arising from Z' or coloron models. The projected discovery potential and
exclusion limits for these resonances is presented in the coupling vs. mass
plane, which highlights both the increased mass reach from higher energy
machines as well as the improved coupling sensivity from larger luminosity.
