Computational Grids are emerging as new infrastructure for Internet-based
parallel and distributed computing. They enable the sharing, exchange,
discovery, and aggregation of resources distributed across multiple
administrative domains, organizations and enterprises. To accomplish this,
Grids need infrastructure that supports various services: security, uniform
access, resource management, scheduling, application composition, computational
economy, and accountability. Many Grid projects have developed technologies
that provide many of these services with an exception of accountability. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a new infrastructure called Grid Bank that
provides services for accounting. This paper presents requirements of Grid
accountability and different models within which it can operate and proposes
Grid Bank Services Architecture that meets them. The paper highlights
implementation issues with detailed discussion on format for various
records/database that the GridBank need to maintain. It also presents protocols
for interaction between GridBank and various components within Grid computing
environments.
