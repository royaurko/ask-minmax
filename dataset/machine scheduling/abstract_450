We present a novel algorithm for reducing the state dimension, i.e. order, of
linear parameter varying (LPV) discrete-time state-space (SS) models with
affine dependence on the scheduling variable. The input-output behavior of the
reduced order model approximates that of the original model. In fact, for input
and scheduling sequences of a certain length, the input-output behaviors of the
reduced and original model coincide. The proposed method can also be
interpreted as a reachability and observability reduction (minimization)
procedure for LPV-SS representations with affine dependence.
