We determine the complexity of counting models of bounded size of
specifications expressed in Linear-time Temporal Logic. Counting word models is
#P-complete, if the bound is given in unary, and as hard as counting accepting
runs of nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machines, if the bound is
given in binary. Counting tree models is as hard as counting accepting runs of
nondeterministic exponential time Turing machines, if the bound is given in
unary. For a binary encoding of the bound, the problem is at least as hard as
counting accepting runs of nondeterministic exponential space Turing machines.
On the other hand, it is not harder than counting accepting runs of
nondeterministic doubly-exponential time Turing machines.
