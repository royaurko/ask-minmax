Consider the problem in which n jobs that are classified into k types are to
be scheduled on m identical machines without preemption. A machine requires a
proper setup taking s time units before processing jobs of a given type. The
objective is to minimize the makespan of the resulting schedule. We design and
analyze an approximation algorithm that runs in time polynomial in n, m and k
and computes a solution with an approximation factor that can be made
arbitrarily close to 3/2.
