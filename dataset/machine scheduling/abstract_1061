A universal deterministic inhibitor Petri net with 14 places, 29 transitions
and 138 arcs was constructed via simulation of Neary and Woods' weakly
universal Turing machine with 2 states and 4 symbols; the total time complexity
is exponential in the running time of their weak machine. To simulate the blank
words of the weakly universal Turing machine, a couple of dedicated transitions
insert their codes when reaching edges of the working zone. To complete a chain
of a given Petri net encoding to be executed by the universal Petri net, a
translation of a bi-tag system into a Turing machine was constructed. The
constructed Petri net is universal in the standard sense; a weaker form of
universality for Petri nets was not introduced in this work.
