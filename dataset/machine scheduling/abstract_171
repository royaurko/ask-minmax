India is country of several hundred different languages. Though twenty two
languages have only been devised as scheduled to the Eighth Schedule of Indian
Constitution in 2007. But as there is yet no proposed compact display
architecture to display all the scheduled language numerals at a time, this
paper proposes a uniform display architecture to display all twenty two
different language digits with higher accuracy and simplicity by using a
17-segment display, which is an improvement over the 16-segment display.
