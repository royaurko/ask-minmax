This paper presents a heuristic method that uses information in the Japanese
text along with knowledge of English countability and number stored in transfer
dictionaries to determine the countability and number of English noun phrases.
Incorporating this method into the machine translation system ALT-J/E, helped
to raise the percentage of noun phrases generated with correct use of articles
and number from 65% to 73%.
