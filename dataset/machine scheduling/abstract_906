This paper summarises works carried out for defining tool trajectory formats
well adapted to High Speed Machining (HSM). Advantages in using native
polynomial formats, calculated directly from the CAD model, are highlighted. In
particular, polynomial surface formats are presented as a generic format for
tool trajectory. Illustrations show that surface formats represent a good
compromise between smoothness machining time, and surface quality.
