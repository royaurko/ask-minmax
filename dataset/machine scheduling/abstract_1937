During the course of an investigation of the interaction of the radio galaxy
M84 and its ambient cluster gas, we found excess X-ray emission aligned with
the northern radio jet. The emission extends from the X-ray core of the host
galaxy as a weak bridge and then brightens to a local peak coincident with the
first detectable radio knot at approx. 2.5" from the core. The second radio
knot at 3.3" is brighter in both radio and X-rays. The X-ray jet terminates
3.9" from the core. Although all the evidence suggests that Doppler favoritism
augments the emission of the northern jet, it is unlikely that the excess X-ray
emission is produced by inverse Compton emission. We find many similarities
between the M84 X-ray jet and recent jet detections from Chandra data of low
luminosity radio galaxies. For most of these current detections synchrotron
emission is the favored explanation for the observed X-rays.
