We calculate the rotation of the inertial frames within an almost flat
cylindrical region surrounded by a pulse of non-axially-symmetric gravitational
waves that rotate about the axis of our cylindrical polar coordinates. Our
spacetime has only one Killing vector. It is along the z-axis and hypersurface
orthogonal. We solve the Einstein equations to first order in the wave
amplitude and superpose such linearized solutions to form a wave pulse. We then
solve the relevant Einstein equation to second order in the amplitude to find
the rotation of inertial frames produced by the pulse. The rotation is without
time delay. The influence of gravitational wave angular momentum on the
inertial frame demonstrates that Mach's principle can not be expressed in terms
of the influence of the stress-energy-momentum tensor alone but must involve
also influences of gravitational wave energy and angular momentum.
