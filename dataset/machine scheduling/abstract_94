Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are gaining popularity as a flexible and
economical alternative to field-bus installations for monitoring and control
applications. For mission-critical applications, communication networks must
provide end-to-end reliability guarantees, posing substantial challenges for
WSN. Reliability can be improved by redundancy, and is often addressed on the
MAC layer by re-submission of lost packets, usually applying slotted
scheduling. Recently, researchers have proposed a strategy to optimally improve
the reliability of a given schedule by repeating the most rewarding slots in a
schedule incrementally until a deadline. This Incrementer can be used with most
scheduling algorithms but has scalability issues which narrows its usability to
offline calculations of schedules, for networks that are rather static. In this
paper, we introduce SchedEx, a generic heuristic scheduling algorithm extension
which guarantees a user-defined end-to-end reliability. SchedEx produces
competitive schedules to the existing approach, and it does that consistently
more than an order of magnitude faster. The harsher the end-to-end reliability
demand of the network, the better SchedEx performs compared to the Incrementer.
We further show that SchedEx has a more evenly distributed improvement impact
on the scheduling algorithms, whereas the Incrementer favors schedules created
by certain scheduling algorithms.
