For high bunch intensities the long-range beam-beam interactions are strong
enough to provoke effects on the orbit. As a consequence the closed orbit
changes. The closed orbit of an unperturbed machine with respect to a machine
where the beam-beam force becomes more and more important has been studied and
the results are presented in this paper.
