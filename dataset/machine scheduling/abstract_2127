One of the main advantages of Logic Programming (LP) is that it provides an
excellent framework for the parallel execution of programs. In this work we
investigate novel techniques to efficiently exploit parallelism from real-world
applications in low cost multi-core architectures. To achieve these goals, we
revive and redesign the YapOr system to exploit or-parallelism based on a
multi-threaded implementation. Our new approach takes full advantage of the
state-of-the-art fast and optimized YAP Prolog engine and shares the underlying
execution environment, scheduler and most of the data structures used to
support YapOr's model. Initial experiments with our new approach consistently
achieve almost linear speedups for most of the applications, proving itself as
a good alternative for exploiting implicit parallelism in the currently
available low cost multi-core architectures.
