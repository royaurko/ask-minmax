We study the problem of scheduling tasks for execution by a processor when
the tasks can stochastically generate new tasks. Tasks can be of different
types, and each type has a fixed, known probability of generating other tasks.
We present results on the random variable S^sigma modeling the maximal space
needed by the processor to store the currently active tasks when acting under
the scheduler sigma. We obtain tail bounds for the distribution of S^sigma for
both offline and online schedulers, and investigate the expected value of
S^sigma.
