Maximizing throughput for heterogeneous parallel server queues has received
quite a bit of attention from the research community and the stability region
for such systems is well understood. However, many real-world systems have
periods where they are temporarily overloaded. Under such scenarios, the
unstable queues often starve limited resources. This work examines what happens
during periods of temporary overload. Specifically, we look at how to fairly
distribute stress. We explore the dynamics of the queue workloads under the
MaxWeight scheduling policy during long periods of stress and discuss how to
tune this policy in order to achieve a target fairness ratio across these
workloads.
