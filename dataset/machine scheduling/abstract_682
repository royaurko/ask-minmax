In this paper, we present a new approach dedicated to correcting the spelling
errors of the Arabic language. This approach corrects typographical errors like
inserting, deleting, and permutation. Our method is inspired from the
Levenshtein algorithm, and allows a finer and better scheduling than
Levenshtein. The results obtained are very satisfactory and encouraging, which
shows the interest of our new approach.
