We report the discovery of a system of isolated nonthermal filaments
approximately 0.5 deg. northwest (75 pc in projection) of Sgr A. Unlike other
isolated nonthermal filaments which show subfilamentation, braiding of
subfilaments, and flaring at their ends, these filaments are simple linear
structures and more closely resemble the parallel bundled filaments in the
Galactic center radio arc. However, the most unusual feature of these filaments
is that the 20/90 cm spectral index uniformly decreases as a function of
length, in contrast to all other nonthermal filaments in the Galactic center.
This spectral gradient may not be due to simple particle aging but could be
explained by a curved electron energy spectrum embedded in a diverging magnetic
field. If so, the scale of the magnetic gradient is not consistent with a large
scale magnetic field centered on Sgr A* suggesting that this filament system is
tracing a local magnetic field.
