We report on the status of our QCD thermodynamics project. It is performed on
the QCDOC machine at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the APEnext machine at
Bielefeld University. Using a 2+1 flavor formulation of QCD at almost realistic
quark masses we calculated several thermodynamical quantities. In this
proceeding we show the susceptibilites of the chiral condensate and the
Polyakov loop, the static quark potential and the spatial string tension.
