We analyzed the cross-correlation of Photovoltaic (PV) output fluctuation for
the actual PV output time series data in both the Tokyo area and the whole of
Japan using the principal component analysis with the random matrix theory.
Based on the obtained cross-correlation coefficients, the forecast error for PV
output was estimated with/without considering the cross-correlations. Then
operation schedule of thermal plants is calculated to integrate PV output using
our unit commitment model with the estimated forecast error. The cost for grid
integration of PV system was also estimated. Finally, validity of the concept
of "local production for local consumption of renewable energy" and alternative
policy implications were also discussed.
