We introduce the zeta number, natural halting probability and natural
complexity of a Turing machine and we relate them to Chaitin's Omega number,
halting probability, and program-size complexity. A classification of Turing
machines according to their zeta numbers is proposed: divergent, convergent and
tuatara. We prove the existence of universal convergent and tuatara machines.
Various results on (algorithmic) randomness and partial randomness are proved.
For example, we show that the zeta number of a universal tuatara machine is
c.e. and random. A new type of partial randomness, asymptotic randomness, is
introduced. Finally we show that in contrast to classical (algorithmic)
randomness--which cannot be naturally characterised in terms of plain
complexity--asymptotic randomness admits such a characterisation.
