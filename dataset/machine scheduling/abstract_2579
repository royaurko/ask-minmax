In this tutorial, we demonstrate how easy it is to construct finite state
machines, in particular automata and transducers, within the computer algebra
system Sage. As a beneficent byproduct, we calculate the asymptotic Hamming
weight of a non-adjacent-form-like digit expansion, which was not known before.
