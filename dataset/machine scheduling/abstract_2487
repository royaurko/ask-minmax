The Turing machine (TM) and the Church thesis have formalized the concept of
computable number, this allowed to display non-computable numbers. This paper
defines the concept of number "approachable" by a TM and shows that some (if
not all) known non-computable numbers are approachable by TMs. Then an example
of a number not approachable by a TM is given.
