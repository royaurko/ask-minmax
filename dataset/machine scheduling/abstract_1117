We describe the design of a suite of software tools to allow users to query
Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) data and perform data mining expeditions. We call this
suite of tools a shed (SHell for Expeditions using Datamining). Our schedule is
to have a completed prototype (funded via the NASA AISRP) by February, 2002.
Meanwhile, interested users will find a partially functioning tool shed at
