The mysterious dark matter has been a subject of special interest to high
energy physicists, astrophysicists and cosmologists for many years. According
to theoretical models, it can make up a significant fraction of the mass of the
Universe. One possible form of galactic dark matter, Weakly Interacting Massive
Particles (WIMPs), could be detected by their annihilation into monoenergetic
gamma-ray line(s). This paper will demonstrate that the Gamma-ray Large Area
Space Telescope (GLAST), scheduled for launch in 2005 by NASA, will be capable
of searching for these gamma-ray lines in the energy range from 20 GeV to ~500
GeV and will be sufficiently sensitive to test a number of models. The required
instrument performance and its capability to reject backgrounds to the required
levels are explicitly discussed.
