BayesPy is an open-source Python software package for performing variational
Bayesian inference. It is based on the variational message passing framework
and supports conjugate exponential family models. By removing the tedious task
of implementing the variational Bayesian update equations, the user can
construct models faster and in a less error-prone way. Simple syntax, flexible
model construction and efficient inference make BayesPy suitable for both
average and expert Bayesian users. It also supports some advanced methods such
as stochastic and collapsed variational inference.
