Photocontrol of reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) was used
to program optoacoustic signal time courses that were temporally unmixed to
increase the proteins contrast-to-noise-ratios (CNRs) in optoacoustic imaging.
In this way, two variants of the RSFP Dronpa with very similar optoacoustic
spectra could be readily discriminated in the presence of highly absorbing
blood. Addition of temporal unmixing to multispectral optoacoustic tomography
(tuMSOT) in conjunction with synthetic or genetically controlled photochromic
contrast agents and customized photoswitching schedules can increase the
performance of multiplexed and high contrast molecular optoacoustic imaging.
