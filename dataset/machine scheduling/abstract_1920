We present the first results of the XMM-Newton observation on the
Groth-Westphal Strip Field. The scheduled exposure time was 70 [ks]. We first
analyzed about 50 [ks] of calibrated and cleaned EPIC-PN data, which were the
only ones we could successfully process with an early version of the SAS
software applicable to these observations. A total of about 110 sources have
been detected in the central 10 arcmin of the PN field of view (FOV). A
cross-correlation with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Medium Deep Survey
(MDS) database shows a range of morphological properties of host galaxies of
the X-ray source. Spectra of hard X-ray sources in our data indeed show
absorption in the range N_H~10^{22}-10^{23} [cm^{-2}] at z~1.
