In a data stream management system (DSMS), users register continuous queries,
and receive result updates as data arrive and expire. We focus on applications
with real-time constraints, in which the user must receive each result update
within a given period after the update occurs. To handle fast data, the DSMS is
commonly placed on top of a cloud infrastructure. Because stream properties
such as arrival rates can fluctuate unpredictably, cloud resources must be
dynamically provisioned and scheduled accordingly to ensure real-time response.
It is quite essential, for the existing systems or future developments, to
possess the ability of scheduling resources dynamically according to the
current workload, in order to avoid wasting resources, or failing in delivering
correct results on time. Motivated by this, we propose DRS, a novel dynamic
resource scheduler for cloud-based DSMSs. DRS overcomes three fundamental
challenges: (a) how to model the relationship between the provisioned resources
and query response time (b) where to best place resources; and (c) how to
measure system load with minimal overhead. In particular, DRS includes an
accurate performance model based on the theory of \emph{Jackson open queueing
networks} and is capable of handling \emph{arbitrary} operator topologies,
possibly with loops, splits and joins. Extensive experiments with real data
confirm that DRS achieves real-time response with close to optimal resource
consumption.
