We study the formation of BTZ black holes by the collision of point
particles. It is shown that the Gott time machine, originally constructed for
the case of vanishing cosmological constant, provides a precise mechanism for
black hole formation. As a result, one obtains an exact analytic understanding
of the Choptuik scaling.
