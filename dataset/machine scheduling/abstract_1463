The resolution of the Maxwell's demon paradox linked thermodynamics with
information theory through information erasure principle. By considering a
demon endowed with a Turing-machine consisting of a memory tape and a
processor, we attempt to extend the link towards statistical mechanics and to
derive results therein in an \textit{operational} fashion. Here, we present a
derivation of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in equilibrium. Further,
because of the universality of the Turing machine, the model can be applied to
non-equilibrium processes, in principle. We demonstrate the
dissipation-fluctuation relation to show the possibility in that direction.
