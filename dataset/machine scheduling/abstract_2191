We propose a checking parameter utilizing the breaking of the Jarzynski
equality in the simulated annealing method using the Monte Carlo method. This
parameter is obtained by applying the Jarzynski equality, and is convenient to
investigate the efficiency of annealing schedules. By using this parameter, it
is detected that the system is not in local minima of the free energy and the
system has reached equilibrium or near-equilibrium. For the spin glass model,
we consider the application to the +-J Ising spin glass model. The application
to the Gaussian Ising spin glass model is also mentioned. We discuss that the
breaking of the Jarzynski equality in this study is induced by the system being
trapped in local minima of the free energy. As an example, we perform a Monte
Carlo simulation to the +-J Ising spin glass model, and show the efficiency of
the use of the present parameter.
