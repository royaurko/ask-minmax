In this work, we present a survey of residential load controlling techniques
to implement demand side management in future smart grid. Power generation
sector facing important challenges both in quality and quantity to meet the
increasing requirements of consumers. Energy efficiency, reliability, economics
and integration of new energy resources are important issues to enhance the
stability of power system infrastructure. Optimal energy consumption scheduling
minimizes the energy consumption cost and reduce the peak-to-average ratio
(PAR) as well as peak load demand in peak hours. In this work, we discuss
different energy consumption scheduling schemes that schedule the household
appliances in real-time to achieve minimum energy consumption cost and reduce
peak load curve in peak hours to shape the peak load demand.
