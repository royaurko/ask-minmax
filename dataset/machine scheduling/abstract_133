In Real-time system, utilization based schedulability test is a common
approach to determine whether or not tasks can be admitted without violating
deadline requirements. The exact problem has previously been proven intractable
even upon single processors; sufficient conditions are presented here for
determining whether a given periodic task system will meet all deadlines if
scheduled non-preemptively upon a multiprocessor platform using the
earliest-deadline first scheduling algorithm. Many real-time scheduling
algorithms have been developed recently to reduce affinity in the portable
devices that use processors. Extensive power aware scheduling techniques have
been published for energy reduction, but most of them have been focused solely
on reducing the processor affinity. The non-preemptive scheduling of periodic
task systems upon processing platforms comprised of several same processors is
considered.
