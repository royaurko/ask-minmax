In this paper we explore various parameter settings of the state-of-art
Statistical Machine Translation system to improve the quality of the
translation for a `distant' language pair like English-Hindi. We proposed new
techniques for efficient reordering. A slight improvement over the baseline is
reported using these techniques. We also show that a simple pre-processing step
can improve the quality of the translation significantly.
