We describe the basic theory of infinite time Turing machines and some recent
developments, including the infinite time degree theory, infinite time
complexity theory, and infinite time computable model theory. We focus
particularly on the application of infinite time Turing machines to the
analysis of the hierarchy of equivalence relations on the reals, in analogy
with the theory arising from Borel reducibility. We define a notion of infinite
time reducibility, which lifts much of the Borel theory into the class
$\bm{\Delta}^1_2$ in a satisfying way.
