Wider adoption of the Grid concept has led to an increasing amount of
federated computational, storage and visualisation resources being available to
scientists and researchers. Distributed and heterogeneous nature of these
resources renders most of the legacy cluster monitoring and management
approaches inappropriate, and poses new challenges in workflow scheduling on
such systems. Effective resource utilisation monitoring and highly granular yet
adaptive measurements are prerequisites for a more efficient Grid scheduler. We
present a suite of measurement applications able to monitor per-process
resource utilisation, and a customisable tool for emulating observed
utilisation models. We also outline our future work on a predictive and
probabilistic Grid scheduler. The research is undertaken as part of UK
e-Science EPSRC sponsored project SO-GRM (Self-Organising Grid Resource
Management) in cooperation with BT.
