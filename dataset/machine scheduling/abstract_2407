Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) is a futuristic combustion
technology that operates with a high fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.
HCCI combustion is characterized by complex nonlinear dynamics which
necessitates a model based control approach for automotive application. HCCI
engine control is a nonlinear, multi-input multi-output problem with state and
actuator constraints which makes controller design a challenging task. Typical
HCCI controllers make use of a first principles based model which involves a
long development time and cost associated with expert labor and calibration. In
this paper, an alternative approach based on machine learning is presented
using extreme learning machines (ELM) and nonlinear model predictive control
(MPC). A recurrent ELM is used to learn the nonlinear dynamics of HCCI engine
using experimental data and is shown to accurately predict the engine behavior
several steps ahead in time, suitable for predictive control. Using the ELM
engine models, an MPC based control algorithm with a simplified quadratic
program update is derived for real time implementation. The working and
effectiveness of the MPC approach has been analyzed on a nonlinear HCCI engine
model for tracking multiple reference quantities along with constraints defined
by HCCI states, actuators and operational limits.
