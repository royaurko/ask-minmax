The first period of the Tevatron Run II has been dominated by low-Pt physics.
Both detectors, and their trigger/DAQ systems have been largely modified to
exploit as much as possible the large wealth of charm and beauty hadrons
produced by the machine, with improvements in the tracking system, magnetic
field, specific triggers based on on-line track reconstruction. Thanks to these
improvements, Tevatron experiments are competitive with dedicated machines, not
only for heavier beauty states but also for charm, both in leptonic and
hadronic decays.
