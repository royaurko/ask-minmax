JUPITER (Jlab Unified Program to Investigate nuclear Targets and
Electroproduction of Resonances) is a new collaboration between the Nuclear
Physics Electron Scattering and High Energy Physics Neutrino Scattering
  Communities to Investigate the Structure of
  Nucleons and Nuclei with Electron and Neutrino Beams.
  The first phase of JUPITER is Hall C experiment E04-001 on
  Inclusive Electron Scattering from Nuclear Targets. First data run of E04-001
is currently scheduled for January of 2005.
