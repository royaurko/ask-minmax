In this paper we solve support vector machines in reproducing kernel Banach
spaces with reproducing kernels defined on nonsymmetric domains instead of the
traditional methods in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Using the
orthogonality of semi-inner-products, we can obtain the explicit
representations of the dual (normalized-duality-mapping) elements of support
vector machine solutions. In addition, we can introduce the reproduction
property in a generalized native space by Fourier transform techniques such
that it becomes a reproducing kernel Banach space, which can be even embedded
into Sobolev spaces, and its reproducing kernel is set up by the related
positive definite function. The representations of the optimal solutions of
support vector machines (regularized empirical risks) in these reproducing
kernel Banach spaces are formulated explicitly in terms of positive definite
functions, and their finite numbers of coefficients can be computed by fixed
point iteration. We also give some typical examples of reproducing kernel
Banach spaces induced by Mat\'ern functions (Sobolev splines) so that their
support vector machine solutions are well computable as the classical
algorithms. Moreover, each of their reproducing bases includes information from
multiple training data points. The concept of reproducing kernel Banach spaces
offers us a new numerical tool for solving support vector machines.
