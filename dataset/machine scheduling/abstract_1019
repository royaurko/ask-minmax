The design of a mechanical transmission taking into account the transmitted
forces is reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a
cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower.
The design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion
from a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission
provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions
and linear drives. The pressure angle is a suitable performance index for this
transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load
vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. To assess the transmission
capability of the mechanism, the Hertz formula is introduced to calculate the
stresses on the rollers and on the cams. The final transmission is intended to
replace the current ball-screws in the Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot
for the production of translational motions, currently under development for
machining applications at Ecole Centrale de Nantes.
