A semiclassical analysis of a two-dimensional electron droplet in a high,
nonuniform magnetic field predicts that the droplet will form ``fingered''
patterns upon increasing the number of electrons. We construct explicit
examples of these patterns using methods first developed for the flow of
two-dimensional viscous fluids. We complement our analytical results with Monte
Carlo simulations of the droplet wavefunction, and find that at the point where
the semiclassical analysis predicts a cusp on the interface, the droplet
fissions--a type of ``quantum breakup'' phenomenon.
