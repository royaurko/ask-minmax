A robust and resilient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is crucial for
numerous machine-type devices to concurrently access the channel in a
Machine-to-Machine (M2M) network. Simplex (reservation or contention based) MAC
protocols are studied in most literatures which may not be able to provide a
scalable solution for M2M networks with large number of heterogeneous devices.
In this paper, a scalable hybrid MAC protocol, which consists of a contention
period and a transmission period, is designed for heterogeneous M2M networks.
In this protocol, different devices with pre-set priorities (hierarchical
contending probabilities) firstly contend the transmission opportunities
following the convention based $p$-persistent CSMA mechanism. Only the
successful devices will be assigned a time slot for transmission following the
reservation based TDMA mechanism. If the devices failed in contention at
previous frame, to ensure the fairness among all devices, their contending
priorities will be raised by increasing their contending probabilities at the
next frame. To balance the tradeoff between the contention and transmission
period in each frame, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the
channel utility by finding the key design parameters: the contention duration,
initial contending probability and the incremental indicator. Analytical and
simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Hybrid MAC
protocol.
