One key requirement for storage clouds is to be able to retrieve data
quickly. Recent system measurements have shown that the data retrieving delay
in storage clouds is highly variable, which may result in a long latency tail.
One crucial idea to improve the delay performance is to retrieve multiple data
copies by using parallel downloading threads. However, how to optimally
schedule these downloading threads to minimize the data retrieving delay
remains to be an important open problem. In this paper, we develop
low-complexity thread scheduling policies for several important classes of data
downloading time distributions, and prove that these policies are either
delay-optimal or within a constant gap from the optimum delay performance.
These theoretical results hold for an arbitrary arrival process of read
requests that may contain finite or infinite read requests, and for
heterogeneous MDS storage codes that can support diverse storage redundancy and
reliability requirements for different data files. Our numerical results show
that the delay performance of the proposed policies is significantly better
than that of First-Come- First-Served (FCFS) policies considered in prior work.
