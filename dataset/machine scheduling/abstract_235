The quality of control (QoC) of a resource-constrained embedded control
system may be jeopardized in dynamic environments with variable workload. This
gives rise to the increasing demand of co-design of control and scheduling. To
deal with uncertainties in resource availability, a fuzzy feedback scheduling
(FFS) scheme is proposed in this paper. Within the framework of feedback
scheduling, the sampling periods of control loops are dynamically adjusted
using the fuzzy control technique. The feedback scheduler provides QoC
guarantees in dynamic environments through maintaining the CPU utilization at a
desired level. The framework and design methodology of the proposed FFS scheme
are described in detail. A simplified mobile robot target tracking system is
investigated as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
FFS scheme. The scheme is independent of task execution times, robust to
measurement noises, and easy to implement, while incurring only a small
overhead.
