This paper presents the design of an autonomic, resource-aware distributed
database which enables data to be backed up and shared without complex manual
administration. The database, H2O, is designed to make use of unused resources
on workstation machines. Creating and maintaining highly-available, replicated
database systems can be difficult for untrained users, and costly for IT
departments. H2O reduces the need for manual administration by autonomically
replicating data and load-balancing across machines in an enterprise.
Provisioning hardware to run a database system can be unnecessarily costly as
most organizations already possess large quantities of idle resources in
workstation machines. H2O is designed to utilize this unused capacity by using
resource availability information to place data and plan queries over
workstation machines that are already being used for other tasks. This paper
discusses the requirements for such a system and presents the design and
implementation of H2O.
