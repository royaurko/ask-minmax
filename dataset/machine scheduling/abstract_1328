A Shake and Bake machine translation algorithm for Head-Driven Phrase
Structure Grammar is introduced based on the algorithm proposed by Whitelock
for unification categorial grammar. The translation process is then analysed to
determine where the potential sources of inefficiency reside, and some
proposals are introduced which greatly improve the efficiency of the generation
algorithm. Preliminary empirical results from tests involving a small grammar
are presented, and suggestions for greater improvement to the algorithm are
provided.
