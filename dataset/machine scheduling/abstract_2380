The Clinical E-Science Framework (CLEF) project was used to extract important
information from medical texts by building a system for the purpose of clinical
research, evidence-based healthcare and genotype-meets-phenotype informatics.
The system is divided into two parts, one part concerns with the identification
of relationships between clinically important entities in the text. The full
parses and domain-specific grammars had been used to apply many approaches to
extract the relationship. In the second part of the system, statistical machine
learning (ML) approaches are applied to extract relationship. A corpus of
oncology narratives that hand annotated with clinical relationships can be used
to train and test a system that has been designed and implemented by supervised
machine learning (ML) approaches. Many features can be extracted from these
texts that are used to build a model by the classifier. Multiple supervised
machine learning algorithms can be applied for relationship extraction. Effects
of adding the features, changing the size of the corpus, and changing the type
of the algorithm on relationship extraction are examined. Keywords: Text
