WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) technology has
emerged in response to the increasing demand for multimedia services in the
internet broadband networks. WiMAX standard has defined five different
scheduling services to meet the QoS (Quality of Service) requirement of
multimedia applications and this paper investigates one specific scheduling
service, i.e. UGS scheduling. In parallel, it was observed that in the
difference of the traditional quality assessment approaches, nowadays, current
researches are centered on the user perception of the quality, the existing
scheduling approaches take into account the QoS, mobility and many other
parameters, but do not consider the Quality of Experience (QoE). In order to
control the packet transmission rate so as to match with the minimum subjective
rate requirements of each user and therefore reduce packet loss and delays, an
efficient scheduling approach has been proposed in this paper. The solution has
been implemented and evaluated in the WiMAX simulation platform developed based
on NS-2. Simulation results show that by applying various levels of MOS (Mean
Opinion Score) the QoE provided to the users is enhanced in term of jitter,
packet loss rate, throughput and delay.
