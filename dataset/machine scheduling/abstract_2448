Based on background measurements at PEP II the impact of machine-related
backgrounds on individual components of multipurpose detectors is examined,
that operate in an asymmetric B factory at luminosities up to 10^{36} cm^{-2}
s^{-1}. Extrapolations of the BABAR experience suggests two feasible detector
designs.
