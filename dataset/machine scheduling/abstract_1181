The ngdp framework is intended to provide a base for the data acquisition
(DAQ) system software. The ngdp's design key features are: high modularity and
scalability; usage of the kernel context (particularly kernel threads) of the
operating systems (OS), which allows to avoid preemptive scheduling and
unnecessary memory--to--memory copying between contexts; elimination of
intermediate data storages on the media slower than the operating memory like
hard disks, etc. The ngdp, having the above properties, is suitable to organize
and manage data transportation and processing for needs of essentially
distributed DAQ systems. The investigation has been performed at the Veksler
and Baldin Laboratory of High Energy Physics, JINR.
