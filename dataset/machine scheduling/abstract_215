This paper introduces a new computing model based on the cooperation among
Turing machines called orchestrated machines. Like universal Turing machines,
orchestrated machines are also designed to simulate Turing machines but they
can also modify the original operation of the included Turing machines to
create a new layer of some kind of collective behavior. Using this new model we
can define some interested notions related to cooperation ability of Turing
machines such as the intelligence quotient or the emotional intelligence
quotient for Turing machines.
