The aim of this paper is to provide a description of deep-learning-based
scheduling approach for academic-purpose high-performance computing systems.
The share of academic-purpose distributed computing systems (DCS) reaches 17.4
percents amongst TOP500 supercomputer sites (15.6 percents in performance
scale) that makes them a valuable object of research. The core of this approach
is to predict the future workflow of the system depending on the previously
submitted tasks using deep learning algorithm. Information on predicted tasks
is used by the resource management system (RMS) to perform efficient schedule.
