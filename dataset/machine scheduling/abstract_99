Air Traffic Flow Management is the regulation of air traffic in order to
avoid exceeding airport or flight sector capacity in handling traffic, and to
ensure that available capacity is used efficiently. We have tried to explore
the logic behind the claims by Bertsimas et.al about integral solutions to the
LP relaxation of the Traffic Flow Management Problem(TFMP). Polyhedral theory
only indicates that the stronger TFMP formulation of Bertsimas et.al might lead
to integral solutions in some cases. Our computations indicate that the
encouraging results reported by Bertsimas et.al are not merely fortuitous or
due to their specific data set. Indeed, we found that the TFMP had integral
solutions even in case of artificial data sets generated to include severe
conflicts in the flight schedules. In our limited tests with 4-5 scenarios, we
obtained non-integral solutions only once. This is of significant practical
importance because, the LP relaxation can be solved even on small machines with
low memory and processor speed.
