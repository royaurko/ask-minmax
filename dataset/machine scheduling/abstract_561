If we establish that the counterexample function for P=NP, if total,
overtakes all total recursive functions when extended over all Turing machines,
then what happens to the same counterexample function when defined over the
so-called Baker-Gill-Solovay (BGS) set of poly machines? We state and prove
here a lemma that tries to answer this query.
