In this report, we derive a non-negative series expansion for the
Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between two probability distributions. This
series expansion is shown to be useful for numerical calculations of the JSD,
when the probability distributions are nearly equal, and for which,
consequently, small numerical errors dominate evaluation.
