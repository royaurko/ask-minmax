Most machine learning algorithms, such as classification or regression, treat
the individual data point as the object of interest. Here we consider extending
machine learning algorithms to operate on groups of data points. We suggest
treating a group of data points as an i.i.d. sample set from an underlying
feature distribution for that group. Our approach employs kernel machines with
a kernel on i.i.d. sample sets of vectors. We define certain kernel functions
on pairs of distributions, and then use a nonparametric estimator to
consistently estimate those functions based on sample sets. The projection of
the estimated Gram matrix to the cone of symmetric positive semi-definite
matrices enables us to use kernel machines for classification, regression,
anomaly detection, and low-dimensional embedding in the space of distributions.
We present several numerical experiments both on real and simulated datasets to
demonstrate the advantages of our new approach.
