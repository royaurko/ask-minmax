To answer the existence of optimal swimmer learning/teaching strategies, this
work introduces a two-level clustering in order to analyze temporal dynamics of
motor learning in breaststroke swimming. Each level have been performed through
Sparse Fisher-EM, a unsupervised framework which can be applied efficiently on
large and correlated datasets. The induced sparsity selects key points of the
coordination phase without any prior knowledge.
