In many situations, Miniature Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are limited to using
only on-board sensors for navigation. This limits the data available to
algorithms used for stabilization and localization, and current control methods
are often insufficient to allow reliable hovering in place or trajectory
following. In this research, we explore using machine learning to predict the
drift (flight path errors) of an MAV while executing a desired flight path.
This predicted drift will allow the MAV to adjust it's flightpath to maintain a
desired course.
