This paper clarifies the picture about Dense-choice Counter Machines, which
have been less studied than (discrete) Counter Machines. We revisit the
definition of "Dense Counter Machines" so that it now extends (discrete)
Counter Machines, and we provide new undecidability and decidability results.
Using the first-order additive mixed theory of reals and integers, we give a
logical characterization of the sets of configurations reachable by
reversal-bounded Dense-choice Counter Machines.
