The aim of this study was to describe the behaviour of a shock machine
designed for testing hip prostheses. A microseparation between head and cup
occurs inducing a shock of several times the body weight, leading to fracture
of ceramic femoral components. Femoral heads and cups of diameter 32 mm
manufactured from alumina were tested in dry and wet conditions. Implants were
subjected to shocks with a load profile of 9 kN load at 2 Hz and various
microseparations. Position is monitored and force is measured with two
acquisition systems. The working range and the device capabilities were
investigated. Only cups tested in dry conditions failed. Observations by
scanning electron microscopy revealed intergranular and transgranular
fractures. Two wear stripes were observed on the heads. Three-dimensional
roughness of wear stripes was measured. Since experimental results are in good
agreement with retrieved femoral heads, the shocks machine reproduces the in
vivo degradations.
