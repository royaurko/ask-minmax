We present measurements of electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity and
thermopower of polycrystalline Sr-doped LaCoO3 with composition
La0.95Sr0.05CoO3. Our data show that the investigated compound exhibits a very
respectable room temperature thermoelectric figure of merit value of 0.18. Our
results not only show that oxides are promising candidates for thermoelectric
cooling applications, but also point towards the need for careful theoretical
calculations that will serve as a guide in producing the next generation of
thermoelectric materials.
