Structure formation within the Lemaitre-Tolman model is investigated in a
general manner. We seek models such that the initial density perturbation
within a homogeneous background has a smaller mass than the structure into
which it will develop, and the perturbation then accretes more mass during
evolution. This is a generalisation of the approach taken by Bonnor in 1956. It
is proved that any two spherically symmetric density profiles specified on any
two constant time slices can be joined by a Lemaitre-Tolman evolution, and
exact implicit formulae for the arbitrary functions that determine the
resulting L-T model are obtained. Examples of the process are investigated
numerically.
