Many learning machines that have hierarchical structure or hidden variables
are now being used in information science, artificial intelligence, and
bioinformatics. However, several learning machines used in such fields are not
regular but singular statistical models, hence their generalization performance
is still left unknown. To overcome these problems, in the previous papers, we
proved new equations in statistical learning, by which we can estimate the
Bayes generalization loss from the Bayes training loss and the functional
variance, on the condition that the true distribution is a singularity
contained in a learning machine. In this paper, we prove that the same
equations hold even if a true distribution is not contained in a parametric
model. Also we prove that, the proposed equations in a regular case are
asymptotically equivalent to the Takeuchi information criterion. Therefore, the
proposed equations are always applicable without any condition on the unknown
true distribution.
