In cloud data center, shared storage with good management is a main structure
used for the storage of virtual machines (VM). In this paper, we proposed
Hybrid VM storage (HVSTO), a privacy preserving shared storage system designed
for the virtual machine storage in large-scale cloud data center. Unlike
traditional shared storage, HVSTO adopts a distributed structure to preserve
privacy of virtual machines, which are a threat in traditional centralized
structure. To improve the performance of I/O latency in this distributed
structure, we use a hybrid system to combine solid state disk and distributed
storage. From the evaluation of our demonstration system, HVSTO provides a
scalable and sufficient throughput for the platform as a service
infrastructure.
