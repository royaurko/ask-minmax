In this article we propose to extend the model of simulation of dispersions
in turning based on the geometrical specifications. Our study is articulated
around two trends of development: the first trend relates to the geometrical
model. The geometrical model suggested must allow a follow-up of the geometry
of the part during the simulation of machining. It is thus a question of
carrying out a systematic treatment of the whole dimensioning and tolerancing
process while being based on the principles of the \DeltaL method. We also
planned to integrate this type of specification in the model of simulation of
machining suggested. It is more generally a question of extending the
traditional model for better taking into account the multi axis specification
of coaxiality and perpendicularity on the turned workpieces. The second trend
of our study relates to the widening of the field of application of the model.
We propose to extend the field of application of the model by taking into
account the modifications of several parameters of the manufacturing process
plans, likely to involve variations of dispersions.
