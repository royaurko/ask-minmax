The k-support norm has been recently introduced to perform correlated
sparsity regularization. Although Argyriou et al. only reported experiments
using squared loss, here we apply it to several other commonly used settings
resulting in novel machine learning algorithms with interesting and familiar
limit cases. Source code for the algorithms described here is available.
