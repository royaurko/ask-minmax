Scheduling applications on wide-area distributed systems is useful for
obtaining quick and reliable results in an efficient manner. Optimized
scheduling algorithms are fundamentally important in order to achieve optimized
resources utilization. The existing and potential applications include many
fields of activity like satellite image processing and medicine. The paper
proposes a scheduling algorithm for tasks with dependencies in Grid
environments. CoAllocation represents a strategy that provides a schedule for
task with dependencies, having as main purpose the efficiency of the schedule,
in terms of load balancing and minimum time for the execution of the tasks.
