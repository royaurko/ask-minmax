During the course of an investigation on the interaction of the radio galaxy
3C129 and its ambient cluster gas, we found excess X-ray emission aligned with
the northern radio jet. The emission extends from the weak X-ray core of the
host galaxy approximately 2.5" to the first resolved radio knot. On a smaller
scale, we have also detected a weak radio extension in the same position angle
with the VLBA. Although all the evidence suggests that Doppler favoritism
augments the emission of the northern jet, it is unlikely that the excess X-ray
emission is produced by inverse Compton emission. We find many similarities
between the 3C129 X-ray jet and recent jet detections from Chandra data of low
luminosity radio galaxies. For most of these current detections synchrotron
emission is the favored explanation for the observed X-rays.
