In this paper the theory of semi-bounded rationality is proposed as an
extension of the theory of bounded rationality. In particular, it is proposed
that a decision making process involves two components and these are the
correlation machine, which estimates missing values, and the causal machine,
which relates the cause to the effect. Rational decision making involves using
information which is almost always imperfect and incomplete as well as some
intelligent machine which if it is a human being is inconsistent to make
decisions. In the theory of bounded rationality this decision is made
irrespective of the fact that the information to be used is incomplete and
imperfect and the human brain is inconsistent and thus this decision that is to
be made is taken within the bounds of these limitations. In the theory of
semi-bounded rationality, signal processing is used to filter noise and
outliers in the information and the correlation machine is applied to complete
the missing information and artificial intelligence is used to make more
consistent decisions.
