In this paper, we have compared r.e. sets based on their enumeration orders
with Turing machines. Accordingly, we have defined novel concept uniformity for
Turing machines and r.e. sets and have studied some relationships between
uniformity and both one-reducibility and Turing reducibility. Furthermore, we
have defined type-2 uniformity concept and studied r.e. sets and Turing
machines based on this concept. In the end, we have introduced a new structure
called Turing Output Binary Search Tree that helps us lighten some ideas.
