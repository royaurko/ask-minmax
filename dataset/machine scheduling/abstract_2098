We introduce a novel search technique that can identify trans-neptunian
objects in three to five exposures of a pointing within a single Hubble Space
Telescope orbit. The process is fast enough to allow the discovery of
candidates soon after the data are available. This allows sufficient time to
schedule follow up observations with HST within a month. We report the
discovery of 14 slow-moving objects found within 5\circ of the ecliptic in
archival data taken with the Wide Field Channel of the Advanced Camera for
Surveys. The luminosity function of these objects is consistent with previous
ground-based and space-based results. We show evidence that the size
distribution of both high and low inclination populations is similar for
objects smaller than 100 km, as expected from collisional evolution models,
while their size distribution differ for brighter objects. We suggest the two
populations formed in different parts of the protoplanetary disk and after
being dynamically mixed have collisionally evolved together. Among the objects
discovered there is an equal mass binary with an angular separation ~ 0."53.
