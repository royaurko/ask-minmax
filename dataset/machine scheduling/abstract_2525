We present a graphical criterion for reading dependencies from the minimal
directed independence map G of a graphoid p when G is a polytree and p
satisfies composition and weak transitivity. We prove that the criterion is
sound and complete. We argue that assuming composition and weak transitivity is
not too restrictive.
