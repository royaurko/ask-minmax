One of the key security threats on the Internet are the compromised machines
that can be used to launch various security attacks such as spamming and
spreading malware, accessing useful information and DDoS. Attackers for
spamming activity are volunteer by large number of compromised machines. Our
main focus is on detection of the compromised machines in a network that may be
or are involved in the spamming activities; these machines are commonly known
as spam zombies. Activities such as port scan, DB scan and so on are treated as
malicious activity within the network. So to overcome that we develop one of
the most effective spam zombie detection system within the network based on the
behavior of other systems as if performing the above activities are treated as
zombies machines. If any system within the network try's to gather some
information about any other system then this is treated as a malicious activity
and should be not allowed to do so. SYN packets are used in order to initiate
communication within the network so as to establish connection. If any system
try's to flood the network with these packets we can make an assumption that
the system is trying to gather the information about other system. This is what
called footprinting. So we will try to detect any system involved in
footprinting and report to the administrator.
