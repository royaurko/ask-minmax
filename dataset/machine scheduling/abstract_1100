Current status data is a data format where the time to event is restricted to
knowledge of whether or not the failure time exceeds a random monitoring time.
We develop a support vector machine learning method for current status data
that estimates the failure time expectation as a function of the covariates. In
order to obtain the support vector machine decision function, we minimize a
regularized version of the empirical risk with respect to a data-dependent
loss. We show that the decision function has a closed form. Using finite sample
bounds and novel oracle inequalities, we prove that the obtained decision
function converges to the true conditional expectation for a large family of
probability measures and study the associated learning rates. Finally we
present a simulation study that compares the performance of the proposed
approach to current state of the art.
