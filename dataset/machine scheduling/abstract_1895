Observations combined with theoretical modeling of the light curve of the
recently discovered supernova 1997D in NGC 1536 suggest that it might host a
black hole formed in the aftermath of the explosion. We consider some
observable consequences of a black hole in SN 1997D and estimate the late--time
accretion luminosity of the material which falls back onto the hole. We find
that this luminosity, decaying with a characteristic power--law dependence on
time, may emerge above the emission of the envelope in just a few years. Its
detection would thus provide unmistakable evidence for the presence of a black
hole.
