Recently there has been intense interest in claims about the performance of
the D-Wave machine. In this paper, we outline a simple classical model, and
show that it achieves excellent correlation with published input-output
behavior of the D-Wave One machine on 108 qubits. While raising questions about
"how quantum" the D-Wave machine is, the new model also provides additional
algorithmic insights into the nature of the native computational problem solved
by the D-Wave machine.
