Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) are a rapidly developing technology that can
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and change the way vehicles obtain power. PEV
charging stations will most likely be available at home and at work, and
occasionally be publicly available, offering flexible charging options.
Ideally, each vehicle will charge during periods when electricity prices are
relatively low, to minimize the cost to the consumer and maximize societal
benefits. A Demand Response (DR) service for a fleet of PEVs could yield such
charging schedules by regulating consumer electricity use during certain time
periods, in order to meet an obligation to the market.
  We construct an automated DR mechanism for a fleet of PEVs that facilitates
vehicle charging to ensure the demands of the vehicles and the market are met.
Our dynamic algorithm depends only on the knowledge of a few hundred driving
behaviors from a previous similar day, and uses a simple adjusted pricing
scheme to instantly assign feasible and satisfactory charging schedules to
thousands of vehicles in a fleet as they plug-in. The charging schedules
generated using our adjusted pricing scheme can ensure that a new demand peak
is not created and can reduce the consumer cost by over 30% when compared to
standard charging, which may also increase peak demand by 3.5%. In this paper,
we present our formulation, algorithm and results.
