Prior distributions of binarized natural images are learned by using
Boltzmann machine. We find that there emerges a structure with two sublattices
in the interactions, and the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor
interactions correspondingly take two discriminative values, which reflects
individual characteristics of three sets of pictures we treat. On the other
hand, in a longer spacial scale, a longer-range (though still rapidly-decaying)
ferromagnetic interaction commonly appear in all the cases. The characteristic
length scale of the interactions is universally about up to four lattice
spacing $\xi \approx 4$. These results are derived by using the mean-field
method which effectively reduces the computational time required in Boltzmann
machine. An improved mean-field method called the Bethe approximation also
gives the same result, which reinforces the validity of our analysis and
findings. Relations to criticality, frustration, and simple-cell receptive
fields are also discussed.
