Paxos is a prominent theory of state machine replication. Recent data
intensive Systems those implement state machine replication generally require
high throughput. Earlier versions of Paxos as few of them are classical Paxos,
fast Paxos and generalized Paxos have a major focus on fault tolerance and
latency but lacking in terms of throughput and scalability. A major reason for
this is the heavyweight leader. Through offloading the leader, we can further
increase throughput of the system. Ring Paxos, Multi Ring Paxos and S-Paxos are
few prominent attempts in this direction for clustered data centers. In this
paper, we are proposing HT-Paxos, a variant of Paxos that one is the best
suitable for any large clustered data center. HT-Paxos further offloads the
leader very significantly and hence increases the throughput and scalability of
the system. While at the same time, among high throughput state-machine
replication protocols, HT-Paxos provides reasonably low latency and response
time.
