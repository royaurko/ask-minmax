Base station (BS) cooperation is set to play a key role in managing
interference in dense heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs). Non-coherent
joint transmission (JT) is particularly appealing due to its low complexity,
smaller overhead, and ability for load balancing. However, a general analysis
of this technique is difficult mostly due to the lack of tractable models. This
paper addresses this gap and presents a tractable model for analyzing
non-coherent JT in HCNs, while incorporating key system parameters such as
user-centric BS clustering and channel-dependent cooperation activation.
Assuming all BSs of each tier follow a stationary Poisson point process, the
coverage probability for non-coherent JT is derived. Using the developed model,
it is shown that for small cooperative clusters of small-cell BSs, non-coherent
JT by small cells provides spectral efficiency gains without significantly
increasing cell load. Further, when cooperation is aggressively triggered
intra-cluster frequency reuse within small cells is favorable over
intra-cluster coordinated scheduling.
