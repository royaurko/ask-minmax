This note gives a simple analysis of a randomized approximation scheme for
matrix multiplication proposed by Sarlos (2006) based on a random rotation
followed by uniform column sampling. The result follows from a matrix version
of Bernstein's inequality and a tail inequality for quadratic forms in
subgaussian random vectors.
