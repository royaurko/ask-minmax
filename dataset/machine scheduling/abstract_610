Despite the promise of brain-inspired machine learning, deep neural networks
(DNN) have frustratingly failed to bridge the deceptively large gap between
learning and memory. Here, we introduce a Perpetual Learning Machine; a new
type of DNN that is capable of brain-like dynamic 'on the fly' learning because
it exists in a self-supervised state of Perpetual Stochastic Gradient Descent.
Thus, we provide the means to unify learning and memory within a machine
learning framework.
