Now a days mobile phones are most often used for data communication rather
than voice calls. Due to this change in user behavior, there is a need to
improve the QoS received by the user. One of the ways of improving the QoS is
an efficient scheduling algorithm which incorporates the needs of the users and
variation in channel condition. The parameters used to measure the efficiency
of the scheduling algorithms are the Jain Fairness Index and the overall system
throughput. In this paper we have proposed a variance based scheduling
algorithm which selects the user who has the highest variance of data
transmitted in a given time frame as a parameter for scheduling. This ensures
that eventually, the users transmit almost equal amounts of data regardless of
channel condition. The simulation results shows that the proposed algorithm
achieves high Jain Fairness Index of 0.92 with a lesser drop in the system
throughput 18% as compared to Dynamically altering Proportionally Fair
Algorithm's 20% using the Proportionally Fair Algorithm as reference.
