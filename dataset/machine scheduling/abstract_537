Scheduling Bag-of-Tasks (BoT) applications on the cloud can be more
challenging than grid and cluster environ- ments. This is because a user may
have a budgetary constraint or a deadline for executing the BoT application in
order to keep the overall execution costs low. The research in this paper is
motivated to investigate task scheduling on the cloud, given two hard
constraints based on a user-defined budget and a deadline. A heuristic
algorithm is proposed and implemented to satisfy the hard constraints for
executing the BoT application in a cost effective manner. The proposed
algorithm is evaluated using four scenarios that are based on the trade-off
between performance and the cost of using different cloud resource types. The
experimental evaluation confirms the feasibility of the algorithm in satisfying
the constraints. The key observation is that multiple resource types can be a
better alternative to using a single type of resource.
