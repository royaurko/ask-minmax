This manuscript aims to develop and describe gain scheduling control concept
for a gas turbine engine which drives a variable pitch propeller. An
architecture for gain-scheduling control is developed that controls the
turboshaft engine for large thrust commands in stable fashion with good
performance. Fuel ow and propeller pitch angle are the two control inputs of
the system. New stability proof has been developed for gain scheduling control
of gas turbine engines using global linearization and LMI techniques. This
approach guarantees absolute stability of the closed loop gas turbine engine
systems with gain-scheduling controllers.
