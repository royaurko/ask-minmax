Standard heat machines (engine, heat pump, refrigerator) are composed of a
system ("working fluid") coupled to at least two equilibrium baths at different
temperatures and periodically driven by an external device (piston or rotor)
called sometimes work reservoir. The aim of this paper is to go beyond this
scheme by considering environments which are stationary but cannot be
decomposed into few baths at thermal equilibrium. Such situations are
important, for example in solar cells, chemical machines in biology, various
realizations of laser cooling or nanoscopic machines driven by laser radiation.
We classify non-equilibrium baths depending on their thermodynamic behavior and
show that the efficiency of heat machines operating under their influences is
limited by a generalized Carnot bound.
