Astroinformatics is a new impact area in the world of astronomy, occasionally
called the final frontier, where several astrophysicists, statisticians and
computer scientists work together to tackle various data intensive astronomical
problems. Exponential growth in the data volume and increased complexity of the
data augments difficult questions to the existing challenges. Classical
problems in Astronomy are compounded by accumulation of astronomical volume of
complex data, rendering the task of classification and interpretation
incredibly laborious. The presence of noise in the data makes analysis and
interpretation even more arduous. Machine learning algorithms and data analytic
techniques provide the right platform for the challenges posed by these
problems. A diverse range of open problem like star-galaxy separation,
detection and classification of exoplanets, classification of supernovae is
discussed. The focus of the paper is the applicability and efficacy of various
machine learning algorithms like K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF),
decision tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na\"ive Bayes and Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in analysis and inference of the decision theoretic
problems in Astronomy. The machine learning algorithms, integrated into
ASTROMLSKIT, a toolkit developed in the course of the work, have been used to
analyze HabCat data and supernovae data. Accuracy has been found to be
appreciably good.
