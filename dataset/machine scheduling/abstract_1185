Simulation is useful for the evaluation of a Master Production/distribution
Schedule (MPS). Also, the goal of this paper is the study of the design of a
simulation model by reducing its complexity. According to theory of
constraints, we want to build reduced models composed exclusively by
bottlenecks and a neural network. Particularly a multilayer perceptron, is
used. The structure of the network is determined by using a pruning procedure.
This work focuses on the impact of discrete data on the results and compares
different approaches to deal with these data. This approach is applied to
sawmill internal supply chain
