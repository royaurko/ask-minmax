In probabilistic cloning with two auxiliary systems, we consider and compare
three different protocols for the success probabilities of cloning. We show
that, in certain circumstances, it may increase the success probability to add
an auxiliary system to the probabilistic cloning machine having one auxiliary
system, but we always can find another cloning machine with one auxiliary
system having the same success probability as that with two auxiliary systems.
