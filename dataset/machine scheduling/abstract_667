Inter-cell interference (ICI) is one of the most critical factors affecting
performance of cellular networks. In this paper, we investigate a joint link
adaptation and user scheduling problem for multi-cell downlink employing HARQ
techniques, where the ICI exists among cells. We first propose an approximation
method on aggregated ICI for analyzing an effective
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) with the HARQ technique at users,
named identical path-loss approximation (IPLA). Based on the proposed IPLA, we
propose a transmission rate selection algorithm maximizing an expected
throughput at each user. We also propose a simple but effective cross-layer
framework jointly combining transmission rate adaptation and user scheduling
techniques, considering both HARQ and ICI. It is shown that statistical
distribution of the effective SINR at users based on the IPLA agrees well with
the empirical distribution, while the conventional Gaussian approximation (GA)
does not work well in the case that dominant ICIs exist. Thus, IPLA enables
base stations to choose more accurate transmission rates. Furthermore, the
proposed IPLA-based cross-layer policy outperforms existing policies in terms
of both system throughput and user fairness.
