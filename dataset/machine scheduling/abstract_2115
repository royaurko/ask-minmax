Despite the extensive use of the agent technology in the Supply Chain
Management field, its integration with Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS)
tools still represents a promising field with several open research questions.
Specifically, the literature falls short in providing an integrated framework
to analyze, specify, design and implement simulation experiments covering the
whole simulation cycle. Thus, this paper proposes an agent-based strategy to
convert the 'analysis' models into 'specification' and 'design' models
combining two existing methodologies proposed in the literature. The first one
is a recent and unique approach dedicated to the 'analysis' of agent-based APS
systems. The second one is a well-established methodological framework to
'specify' and 'design' agent-based supply chain systems. The proposed
conversion strategy is original and is the first one allowing simulation
analysts to integrate the whole simulation development process in the domain of
distributed APS.
