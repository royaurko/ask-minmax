Cognitive Radio has been proposed as a key technology to significantly
improve spectrum usage in wireless networks by enabling unlicensed users to
access unused resource. We present new algorithms that are needed for the
implementation of opportunistic scheduling policies that maximize the
throughput utilization of resources by secondary users, under maximum
interference constraints imposed by existing primary users. Our approach is
based on the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, which is advantageous due to
its simplicity and potential for distributed implementation. We examine
convergence properties and evaluate the performance of the proposed BP
algorithms via simulations and demonstrate that the results compare favorably
with a benchmark greedy strategy.
