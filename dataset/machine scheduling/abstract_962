We give a new ``nested adds'' circuit for implementing Shor's algorithm in
linear width and quadratic depth on a nearest-neighbor machine. Our circuit
combines Draper's transform adder with approximation ideas of Zalka. The
transform adder requires small controlled rotations. We also give another
version, with slightly larger depth, using only reversible classical gates. We
do not know which version will ultimately be cheaper to implement.
