Despite rapid evolution, embedded computing systems increasingly feature
resource constraints and workload uncertainties. To achieve much better system
performance in unpredictable environments than traditional design approaches, a
novel methodology, control-scheduling codesign, is emerging in the context of
integrating feedback control and real-time computing. The aim of this work is
to provide a better understanding of this emerging methodology and to spark new
interests and developments in both the control and computer science
communities. The state of the art of control-scheduling codesign is captured.
Relevant research efforts in the literature are discussed under two categories,
i.e., control of computing systems and codesign for control systems. Critical
open research issues on integrating control and computing are also outlined.
