The current status of the control system for a new high intensity proton
accelerator, the JAERI-KEK Joint Project, is presented. The Phase 1 of the
Joint-Project has been approved and recently started its construction at JAERI
site at Tokai. The first beam commissioning is scheduled in 2006. In parallel
with it, a 60-MeV Linac is now being constructed at KEK site at Tsukuba for R&D
purpose. Recently the Project has officially decided to use the Experimental
Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS). Under the EPICS environment, we
are challenging to implement the Ethernet/IP network for all communication,
even at the level of end-point controllers which are so far connected via a
field bus. In order to realize such a system, three new controllers (PLCs,
WE7000 stations and general-purpose Ethernet boards) are being developed. A
prototype EPICS driver for the PLCs works fine and is used to control the
ion-source at the KEK Linac.
