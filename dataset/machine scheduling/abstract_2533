$KS$-algebra consists of expressions constructed with four kinds operations,
the minimum, maximum, difference and additively homogeneous generalized means.
Five families of $Z$-classifiers are investigated on binary classification
tasks between English phonemes. It is shown that the classifiers are able to
reflect well known formant characteristics of vowels, while having very small
Kolmogoroff's complexity.
