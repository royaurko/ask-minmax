We study the stochastic dynamics of Ising spin models with random bonds,
interacting on finitely connected Poissonnian random graphs. We use the
dynamical replica method to derive closed dynamical equations for the joint
spin-field probability distribution, and solve these within the replica
symmetry ansatz. Although the theory is developed in a general setting, with a
view to future applications in various other fields, in this paper we apply it
mainly to the dynamics of the Glauber algorithm (extended with cooling
schedules) when running on the so-called vertex cover optimization problem. Our
theoretical predictions are tested against both Monte Carlo simulations and
known results from equilibrium studies. In contrast to previous dynamical
analyses based on deriving closed equations for only a small numbers of scalar
order parameters, the agreement between theory and experiment in the present
study is nearly perfect.
