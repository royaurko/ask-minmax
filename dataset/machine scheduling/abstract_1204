The advance of Internet and Sensor technology has brought about new
challenges evoked by the emergence of continuous data streams. Beyond rapid
data processing, application areas like ambient assisted living, robotics, or
dynamic scheduling involve complex reasoning tasks. We address such scenarios
and elaborate upon approaches to knowledge-intense stream reasoning, based on
Answer Set Programming (ASP). While traditional ASP methods are devised for
singular problem solving, we develop new techniques to formulate and process
problems dealing with emerging as well as expiring data in a seamless way.
