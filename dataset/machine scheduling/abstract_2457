We examine the utility of employing polarized lepton (electron and muon)
beams to perform indirect searches for scalar leptoquarks. We find that
polarization can extend the reach in excluding leptoquark masses for both
$e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$ machines. Polarization can also provide a diagnostic
tool for determining leptoquark couplings.
