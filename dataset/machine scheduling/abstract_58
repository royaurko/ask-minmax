This article introduces a highly parallel algorithm for molecular dynamics
simulations with short-range forces on single node multi- and many-core
systems. The algorithm is designed to achieve high parallel speedups for
strongly inhomogeneous systems like nanodevices or nanostructured materials. In
the proposed scheme the calculation of the forces and the generation of
neighbor lists is divided into small tasks. The tasks are then executed by a
thread pool according to a dependent task schedule. This schedule is
constructed in such a way that a particle is never accessed by two threads at
the same time.Benchmark simulations on a typical 12 core machine show that the
described algorithm achieves excellent parallel efficiencies above 80 % for
different kinds of systems and all numbers of cores. For inhomogeneous systems
the speedups are strongly superior to those obtained with spatial
decomposition. Further benchmarks were performed on an Intel Xeon Phi
coprocessor. These simulations demonstrate that the algorithm scales well to
large numbers of cores.
