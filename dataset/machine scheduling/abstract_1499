The amount of information in the form of features and variables avail- able
to machine learning algorithms is ever increasing. This can lead to classifiers
that are prone to overfitting in high dimensions, high di- mensional models do
not lend themselves to interpretable results, and the CPU and memory resources
necessary to run on high-dimensional datasets severly limit the applications of
the approaches. Variable and feature selection aim to remedy this by finding a
subset of features that in some way captures the information provided best. In
this paper we present the general methodology and highlight some specific
approaches.
