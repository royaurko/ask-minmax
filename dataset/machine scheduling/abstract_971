The present work proves that P=NP. The proof, presented in this work, is a
constructive one: the program of a polynomial time deterministic multi-tape
Turing machine M_ExistsAcceptingPath, that determines if there exists an
accepting computational path of a polynomial time non-deterministic single-tape
Turing machine M_NP, is constructed (machine M_ExistsAcceptingPath is different
for each machine M_NP). Machine M_ExistsAcceptingPath is based on reduction to
problem LP (linear programming) instead of reduction to problem 3-CNF-SAT which
is commonly used. The time complexity of machine M_ExistsAcceptingPath is
O(t(n)^{208}) wherein t(n) is an upper bound of the time complexity of machine
M_NP.
