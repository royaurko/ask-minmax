In a multicell multiuser MIMO downlink employing random beamforming as the
transmission scheme, the heterogeneous large scale channel effects of intercell
and intracell interference complicate analysis of distributed scheduling based
systems. In this paper, we extend the analysis in [1] and [2] to study the
aforementioned challenging scenario. The cumulative distribution function
(CDF)-based scheduling policy utilized in [1] and [2] is leveraged to maintain
fairness among users and simultaneously obtain multiuser diversity gain. The
closed form expression of the individual sum rate for each user is derived
under the CDF-based scheduling policy. More importantly, with this distributed
scheduling policy, we conduct asymptotic (in users) analysis to determine the
limiting distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, and
establish the individual scaling laws for each user.
