We present an analysis of anomaly detection for machine learning redshift
estimation. Anomaly detection allows the removal of poor training examples,
which can adversely influence redshift estimates. Anomalous training examples
may be photometric galaxies with incorrect spectroscopic redshifts, or galaxies
with one or more poorly measured photometric quantity. We select 2.5 million
'clean' SDSS DR12 galaxies with reliable spectroscopic redshifts, and 6730
'anomalous' galaxies with spectroscopic redshift measurements which are flagged
as unreliable. We contaminate the clean base galaxy sample with galaxies with
unreliable redshifts and attempt to recover the contaminating galaxies using
the Elliptical Envelope technique. We then train four machine learning
architectures for redshift analysis on both the contaminated sample and on the
preprocessed 'anomaly-removed' sample and measure redshift statistics on a
clean validation sample generated without any preprocessing. We find an
improvement on all measured statistics of up to 80% when training on the
anomaly removed sample as compared with training on the contaminated sample for
each of the machine learning routines explored. We further describe a method to
estimate the contamination fraction of a base data sample.
