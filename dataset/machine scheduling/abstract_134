We consider an online preemptive scheduling problem where jobs with deadlines
arrive sporadically. A commitment requirement is imposed such that the
scheduler has to either accept or decline a job immediately upon arrival. The
scheduler's decision to accept an arriving job constitutes a contract with the
customer; if the accepted job is not completed by its deadline as promised, the
scheduler loses the value of the corresponding job and has to pay an additional
penalty depending on the amount of unfinished workload. The objective of the
online scheduler is to maximize the overall profit, i.e., the total value of
the admitted jobs completed before their deadlines less the penalty paid for
the admitted jobs that miss their deadlines. We show that the maximum
competitive ratio is $3-2\sqrt{2}$ and propose a simple online algorithm to
achieve this competitive ratio. The optimal scheduling includes a threshold
admission and a greedy scheduling policies. The proposed algorithm has direct
applications to the charging of plug-in hybrid electrical vehicles (PHEV) at
garages or parking lots.
