Near-infrared surveys have very promising cosmological applications. The DENIS
2 micron survey, currently in camera-testing, is scheduled to begin in early
1995, and to map the entire southern sky in the $I$, $J$, and $K'$ bands. The
steps for the near-homogeneous extraction of $\sim 10^5$ galaxies are outlined,
some pitfalls are given, and the estimated limiting capabilities of the survey
are presented. A preliminary $J$-band image illustrates these capabilities and
some of the hidden pitfalls. The necessary spectroscopic followup is shown to
be feasible on a reasonably short timescale.
