Recurrence plots were introduced to help aid the detection of signals in
complicated data series. This effort was furthered by the quantification of
recurrence plot elements. We now demonstrate the utility of combining
recurrence quantification analysis with principal components analysis to allow
for a probabilistic evaluation for the presence of deterministic signals in
relatively short data lengths.
