The work of automatic segmentation of a Manipuri language (or Meiteilon) word
into syllabic units is demonstrated in this paper. This language is a scheduled
Indian language of Tibeto-Burman origin, which is also a very highly
agglutinative language. This language usages two script: a Bengali script and
Meitei Mayek (Script). The present work is based on the second script. An
algorithm is designed so as to identify mainly the syllables of Manipuri origin
word. The result of the algorithm shows a Recall of 74.77, Precision of 91.21
and F-Score of 82.18 which is a reasonable score with the first attempt of such
kind for this language.
