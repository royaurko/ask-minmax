A Turing machine with faults, failures and recovery (TMF) is described. TMF
is (weakly) non-deterministic Turing machine consisting of five semi-infinite
tapes (Master Tape, Synchro Tape, Backup Tape, Backup Synchro Tape, User Tape)
and four controlling components (Program, Daemon, Apparatus, User).
Computational process consists of three phases (Program Phase, Failure Phase,
Repair Phase). C++ Simulator of a Turing machine with faults, failures and
recovery has been developed.
