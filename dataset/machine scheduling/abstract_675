In this paper we analyse the reasons which lead to a fuzzy spacetime
approach. We then consider an experimental consequence, viz., a modified
dispersion relation, which could be detected in ultra high energy cosmic rays,
by for example NASA's GLAST Satellite scheduled to be launched in 2006. We also
study the implications for the theory of non-Abelian Gauge Fields.
