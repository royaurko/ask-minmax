The phase transition of the even offspringed branching and annihilating
random walk is studied by N-cluster mean-field approximations on
one-dimensional lattices. By allowing to reach zero branching rate a phase
transition can be seen for any N <= 12.The coherent anomaly extrapolations
applied for the series of approximations results in $\nu_{\perp}=1.85(3)$ and
$\beta=0.96(2)$.
