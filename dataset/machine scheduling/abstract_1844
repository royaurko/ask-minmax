Recent research shows that colluded malware in different VMs sharing physical
host may use access latency of a resource as a covert channel to leak critical
information. Covert channels employ time characteristics to transmit
confidential information to attackers. In this manuscript we have made two
important contributions and to the best of our knowledge they are novel. One is
to propose a framework for detecting covert channel attack based anomalies in
cloud using machine learning . This framework is based on application
criticality where the degree of error tolerance will be based on the
sensitivity of application. This is a useful feature for cloud based
applications as SLAs are trade off between service and cost. There are two
modules of the framework, a cluster monitor and another module becomes part of
hypervisor for monitoring purposes. Second contribution is we propose an
approach to distribute the machine learning technique in such a manner to be
able to handle imbalance learning as well as enabling SVM to handle large
datasets.
