To represent mutually exclusive procedures, we propose a choice-conjunctive
declaration statement of the form $uchoo(S,R)$ where $S, R$ are the procedure
declaration statements within a module. This statement has the following
semantics: request the machine to choose a successful one between $S$ and $R$.
This statement is useful for representing objects with mutually exclusive
procedures. We illustrate our idea via C^uchoo, an extension of the core C with
a new statement.
