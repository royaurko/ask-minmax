Queueing networks are typically modelled assuming that the arrival process is
exogenous, and unaffected by admission control, scheduling policies, etc. In
many situations, however, users choose the time of their arrival strategically,
taking delay and other metrics into account. In this paper, we develop a
framework to study such strategic arrivals into queueing networks. We start by
deriving a functional strong law of large numbers (FSLLN) approximation to the
queueing network. In the fluid limit derived, we then study the population game
wherein users strategically choose when to arrive, and upon arrival which of
the K queues to join. The queues start service at given times, which can
potentially be different. We characterize the (strategic) arrival process at
each of the queues, and the price of anarchy of the ensuing strategic arrival
game. We then extend the analysis to multiple populations of users, each with a
different cost metric. The equilibrium arrival profile and price of anarchy are
derived. Finally, we present the methodology for exact equilibrium analysis.
This, however, is tractable for only some simple cases such as two users
arriving at a two node queueing network, which we then present.
