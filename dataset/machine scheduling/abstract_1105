This paper presents a step-by-step methodology for Twitter sentiment
analysis. Two approaches are tested to measure variations in the public opinion
about retail brands. The first, a lexicon-based method, uses a dictionary of
words with assigned to them semantic scores to calculate a final polarity of a
tweet, and incorporates part of speech tagging. The second, machine learning
approach, tackles the problem as a text classification task employing two
supervised classifiers - Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. We show that
combining the lexicon and machine learning approaches by using a lexicon score
as a one of the features in Naive Bayes and SVM classifications improves the
accuracy of classification by 5%.
