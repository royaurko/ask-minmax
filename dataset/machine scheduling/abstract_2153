Management of project planning, monitoring, scheduling, estimation and risk
management are critical issues faced by a project manager during development
life cycle of software. In RUP, project management is considered as core
discipline whose activities are carried in all phases during development of
software products. On other side service monitoring is considered as best
practice of SOA which leads to availability, auditing, debugging and tracing
process. In this paper, contributors define a strategy to incorporate the service
monitoring of SOA into RUP to improve the artifacts of project management
activities. Moreover, the contributors define the rules to implement the features of
service monitoring, which help the project manager to carry on activities in
well define manner. Proposed frame work is implemented on RB (Resuming Bank)
application and obtained improved results on PM (Project Management) work.
