Improving energy efficiency of wireless systems by exploiting the context
information has received attention recently as the smart phone market keeps
expanding. In this paper, we devise energy-saving resource allocation policy
for multiple base stations serving non-real-time traffic by exploiting three
levels of context information, where the background traffic is assumed to
occupy partial resources. Based on the solution from a total energy
minimization problem with perfect future information,a context-aware BS
sleeping, scheduling and power allocation policy is proposed by estimating the
required future information with three levels of context information.
Simulation results show that our policy provides significant gains over those
without exploiting any context information. Moreover, it is seen that different
levels of context information play different roles in saving energy and
reducing outage in transmission.
