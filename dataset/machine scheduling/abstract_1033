In this paper we present a novel method for retrieving information in
languages other than that of the query. We use this technique in combination
with existing traditional Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR)
techniques to improve their results. This method has a number of advantages
over traditional techniques that rely on machine translation to translate the
query and then search the target document space using a machine translation.
This method is not limited to the availability of a machine translation
algorithm for the desired language and uses already existing sources of readily
available translated information on the internet as a "middle-man" approach. In
this paper we use Wikipedia; however, any similar multilingual, cross
referenced body of documents can be used. For evaluation and comparison
purposes we also implemented a traditional machine translation approach
separately as well as the Wikipedia approach separately.
