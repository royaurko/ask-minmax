In this paper we consider greedy scheduling algorithms in wireless networks,
i.e., the schedules are computed by adding links greedily based on some
priority vector. Two special cases are considered: 1) Longest Queue First (LQF)
scheduling, where the priorities are computed using queue lengths, and 2)
Static Priority (SP) scheduling, where the priorities are pre-assigned. We
first propose a closed-form lower bound stability region for LQF scheduling,
and discuss the tightness result in some scenarios. We then propose an lower
bound stability region for SP scheduling with multiple priority vectors, as
well as a heuristic priority assignment algorithm, which is related to the
well-known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The performance gain of the
proposed heuristic algorithm is finally confirmed by simulations.
