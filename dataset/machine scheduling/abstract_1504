The article deals with the problems in constructing a protection system of
executable code. The techniques of breaking the integrity of executable code
and ways to eliminate them are described. The adoption of virtual machine
technology in the context of executable code protection from analysis is
considered. The substantiation of the application of virtual machines as the
best way to oppose the analysis of executable code is made. The protection of
executable code by transferring the protected code in a virtual execution
environment is considered. An efficient implementation of the method is
proposed.
