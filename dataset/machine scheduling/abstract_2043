The Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), scheduled to be launched in
fall 2007, is the next generation satellite for high-energy gamma-ray
astronomy. The Large Area Telescope (LAT),
  GLAST main instrument, with a wide field of view (> 2 sr), a large effective
area (> 8000 cm^2 at 1 GeV) and 20 MeV - 300 GeV energy range, will provide
excellent high energy gamma-ray observations for Dark Matter searches. In this
paper we examine the potential of the LAT to detect gamma-rays coming from
WIMPS annihilation in the context of supersymmetry. As an example, two search
regions are investigated: the galactic center and the galactic satellites.
