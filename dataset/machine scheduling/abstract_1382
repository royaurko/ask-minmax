Linearly bounded Turing machines have been mainly studied as acceptors for
context-sensitive languages. We define a natural class of infinite automata
representing their observable computational behavior, called linearly bounded
graphs. These automata naturally accept the same languages as the linearly
bounded machines defining them. We present some of their structural properties
as well as alternative characterizations in terms of rewriting systems and
context-sensitive transductions. Finally, we compare these graphs to rational
graphs, which are another class of automata accepting the context-sensitive
languages, and prove that in the bounded-degree case, rational graphs are a
strict sub-class of linearly bounded graphs.
