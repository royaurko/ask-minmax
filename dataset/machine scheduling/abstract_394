In this work we analyze the multiply-exponential complexity classes for
write-once Turing machines, i.e. machines that can write to a given tape cell
at most once. We show that $k$-DExpWOSpace = $k$-DExpWOTime = $k$-ExpTime and
the nondeterministic counterpart. For alternating machines we show that
$k$-AExpWOTime = $k$-AExpTime = $k-1$-ExpSpace.
