Security is the most important part in data communication system, where more
randomization in secret keys increases the security as well as complexity of
the cryptography algorithms. As a result in recent dates these algorithms are
compensating with enormous memory spaces and large execution time on hardware
platform. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), provide one of the major
alternative in hardware platform scenario due to its reconfiguration nature,
low price and marketing speed. In FPGA based embedded system we can use
embedded processor to execute particular algorithm with the inclusion of a real
time operating System (RTOS), where threads may reduce resource utilization and
time consumption. A process in the runtime is separated in different smaller
tasks which are executed by the scheduler to meet the real time dead line using
RTOS. In this paper we demonstrate the design and implementation of a 128-bit
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) both symmetric key encryption and decryption
algorithm by developing suitable hardware and software design on Xilinx
Spartan- 3E (XC3S500E-FG320) device using an Xilkernel RTOS, the implementation
has been tested successfully The system is optimized in terms of execution
speed and hardware utilization.
