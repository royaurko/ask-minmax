We describe a method of using statistically-collected Chinese character
groups from a corpus to augment a Chinese dictionary. The method is
particularly useful for extracting domain-specific and regional words not
readily available in machine-readable dictionaries. Output was evaluated both
using human evaluators and against a previously available dictionary. We also
evaluated performance improvement in automatic Chinese tokenization. Results
show that our method outputs legitimate words, acronymic constructions, idioms,
names and titles, as well as technical compounds, many of which were lacking
from the original dictionary.
