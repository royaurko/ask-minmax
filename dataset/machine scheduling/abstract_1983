Specific heat and resistivity measurements were performed on polycrystalline
samples of the solid-solution Y_xLu_(1-x)Ni2B2C in order to determine
thermodynamic properties such as the specific-heat difference, the
thermodynamic critical field H_c(T), as well as the upper critical field
H_{c2}(T). These properties were analyzed within the Eliashberg theory
including anisotropy effects, yielding electron-phonon coupling anisotropy
parameters <a_k^2> ranging beween 0.02 and 0.03 for the whole series, and Fermi
velocity anisotropy parameters of <b_k^2> = 0.245-0.3. Excellent agreement
between theory and experiment was achieved for these parameters, the Sommerfeld
constant and model phonon spectra determined from specific heat measurements.
An analysis of the previously investigated boronitride La3Ni2B2N3 for
comparison revealed the electron-phonon anisotropy to be of great significance
in describing its thermodynamic properties and the calculations yielded <a_k^2>
\~ 0.08 and <b_k^2> ~ 0.245. The T_c-behavior within the series
Y_xLu_(1-x)Ni2B2C is discussed in terms of coupling and impurity effects, and
the density of states at the Fermi level N(0).
