A generation algorithm based on an active chart parsing algorithm is
introduced which can be used in conjunction with a Shake and Bake machine
translation system. A concise Prolog implementation of the algorithm is
provided, and some performance comparisons with a shift-reduce based algorithm
are given which show the chart generator is much more efficient for generating
all possible sentences from an input specification.
