The DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey is the first project to study the distant
Universe by obtaining a data set comparable in size and nature to recent
generations of local surveys. Made possible by the largest ground-based optical
telescopes and new instrumentation, DEEP2 was designed to measure both the
properties of galaxies at z ~ 1 and their distribution in space, enabling a
number of unique tests of galaxy formation and evolution. Here, we first
provide an overview of the survey, including the planned second major data
release scheduled for early 2007. We then present new results from DEEP2
pertaining to the relationship between galaxy properties and environment at
intermediate redshift, revealing where and when typical ~L* galaxies began
quenching and moved onto the red sequence in significant number.
