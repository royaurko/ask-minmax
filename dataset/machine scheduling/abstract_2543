Given a class of closed Riemannian manifolds with prescribed geometric
conditions, we introduce an embedding of the manifolds into $\ell^2$ based on
the heat kernel of the Connection Laplacian associated with the Levi-Civita
connection on the tangent bundle. As a result, we can construct a distance in
this class which leads to a pre-compactness theorem on the class under
consideration.
