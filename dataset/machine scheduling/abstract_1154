Experimental signals for indirect CPT violation in the neutral-meson systems
are studied in the context of a general CPT- and Lorentz-violating
standard-model extension. In this explicit theory, some CPT observables depend
on the meson momentum and exhibit diurnal variations. The consequences for CPT
tests vary significantly with the specific experimental scenario. The wide
range of possible effects is illustrated for two types of CPT experiment
presently underway, one involving boosted uncorrelated kaons and the other
involving unboosted correlated kaon pairs.
