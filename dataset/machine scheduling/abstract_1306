Heterogeneous multi core processors can offer diverse computing capabilities.
The efficiency of Market Basket Analysis Algorithm can be improved with
heterogeneous multi core processors. Market basket analysis algorithm utilises
apriori algorithm and is one of the popular data mining algorithms which can
utilise Map/Reduce framework to perform analysis. The algorithm generates
association rules based on transactional data and Map/Reduce motivates to
redesign and convert the existing sequential algorithms for efficiency. Hadoop
is the parallel programming platform built on Hadoop Distributed File
Systems(HDFS) for Map/Reduce computation that process data as (key, value)
pairs. In Hadoop map/reduce, the sequential jobs are parallelised and the Job
Tracker assigns parallel tasks to the Task Tracker. Based on single threaded or
multithreaded parallel tasks in the task tracker, execution is carried out in
the appropriate cores. For this, a new scheduler called MB Scheduler can be
developed. Switching between the cores can be made static or dynamic. The use
of heterogeneous multi core processors optimizes processing capabilities and
power requirements for a processor and improves the performance of the system.
