We describe first results of a project to create weak lensing mass maps for a
complete, X-ray luminosity-limited sample of 19 nearby (z < 0.1) southern
galaxy clusters scheduled for Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations by the Viper
Telescope at the South Pole. We have collected data on 1/3 of the sample and
present motivation for the project as well as projected mass maps of two
clusters.
