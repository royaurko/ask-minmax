Motivated by multi-task machine learning with Banach spaces, we propose the
notion of vector-valued reproducing kernel Banach spaces (RKBS). Basic
properties of the spaces and the associated reproducing kernels are
investigated. We also present feature map constructions and several concrete
examples of vector-valued RKBS. The theory is then applied to multi-task
machine learning. Especially, the representer theorem and characterization
equations for the minimizer of regularized learning schemes in vector-valued
RKBS are established.
