We propose a long-term memory design for artificial general intelligence
based on Solomonoff's incremental machine learning methods. We use R5RS Scheme
and its standard library with a few omissions as the reference machine. We
introduce a Levin Search variant based on Stochastic Context Free Grammar
together with four synergistic update algorithms that use the same grammar as a
guiding probability distribution of programs. The update algorithms include
adjusting production probabilities, re-using previous solutions, learning
programming idioms and discovery of frequent subprograms. Experiments with two
training sequences demonstrate that our approach to incremental learning is
effective.
