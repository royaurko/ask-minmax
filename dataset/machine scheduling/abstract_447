Modern embedded systems have made the transition from single-core to
multi-core architectures, providing performance improvement via parallelism
rather than higher clock frequencies. DAGs are considered among the most
generic task models in the real-time domain and are well suited to exploit this
parallelism. In this paper we provide a schedulability test using response-time
analysis exploiting exploring and bounding the self interference of a DAG task.
Additionally we bound the interference a high priority task has on lower
priority ones.
