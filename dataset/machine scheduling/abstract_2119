The notion of innocent strategy was introduced by Hyland and Ong in order to
capture the interactive behaviour of lambda-terms and PCF programs. An innocent
strategy is defined as an alternating strategy with partial memory, in which
the strategy plays according to its view. Extending the definition to
non-alternating strategies is problematic, because the traditional definition
of views is based on the hypothesis that Opponent and Proponent alternate
during the interaction. Here, we take advantage of the diagrammatic
reformulation of alternating innocence in asynchronous games, in order to
provide a tentative definition of innocence in non-alternating games. The task
is interesting, and far from easy. It requires the combination of true
concurrency and game semantics in a clean and organic way, clarifying the
relationship between asynchronous games and concurrent games in the sense of
Abramsky and Melli\`es. It also requires an interactive reformulation of the
usual acyclicity criterion of linear logic, as well as a directed variant, as a
scheduling criterion.
