We extend the well-known BFGS quasi-Newton method and its memory-limited
variant LBFGS to the optimization of nonsmooth convex objectives. This is done
in a rigorous fashion by generalizing three components of BFGS to
subdifferentials: the local quadratic model, the identification of a descent
direction, and the Wolfe line search conditions. We prove that under some
technical conditions, the resulting subBFGS algorithm is globally convergent in
objective function value. We apply its memory-limited variant (subLBFGS) to
L_2-regularized risk minimization with the binary hinge loss. To extend our
algorithm to the multiclass and multilabel settings, we develop a new,
efficient, exact line search algorithm. We prove its worst-case time complexity
bounds, and show that our line search can also be used to extend a recently
developed bundle method to the multiclass and multilabel settings. We also
apply the direction-finding component of our algorithm to L_1-regularized risk
minimization with logistic loss. In all these contexts our methods perform
comparable to or better than specialized state-of-the-art solvers on a number
of publicly available datasets. An open source implementation of our algorithms
is freely available.
