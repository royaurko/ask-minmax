We present a computational modeling framework for data-driven simulations and
analysis of infectious disease spread in large populations. For the purpose of
efficient simulations, we devise a parallel solution algorithm targeting
multi-socket shared memory architectures. The model integrates infectious
dynamics as continuous-time Markov chains and available data such as animal
movements or aging are incorporated as externally defined events. To bring out
parallelism and accelerate the computations, we decompose the spatial domain
and optimize cross-boundary communication using dependency-aware task
scheduling. Using registered livestock data at a high spatio-temporal
resolution, we demonstrate that our approach not only is resilient to varying
model configurations, but also scales on all physical cores at realistic work
loads. Finally, we show that these very features enable the solution of inverse
problems on national scales.
