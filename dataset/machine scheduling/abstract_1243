Statistical comparisons of electoral variables are made between groups of
electronic voting machines and voting centers classified by types of
transmissions according to the volume of traffic in incoming and outgoing data
of machines from and toward the National Electoral Council (CNE) totalizing
servers. One unexpectedly finds two types of behavior in wire telephony data
transmissions and only one type where cellular telephony is employed,
contravening any reasonable electoral normative. Differentiation in data
transmissions arise when comparing number of incoming and outgoing data bytes
per machine against total number of votes per machine reported officially by
the CNE. The respective distributions of electoral variables for each type of
transmission show that the groups classified by it do not correspond to random
sets of the electoral universe. In particular, the distributions for the NO
percentage of votes per machine differ statistically across groups. The
presidential elections of 1998, 2000 and the 2004 Presidential Recall
Referendum (2004 PRR) are compared according to the type of transmissions in
2004 PRR. Statistically, the difference between the empirical distributions of
the 2004 PRR NO results and the 2000 Chavez votes results by voting centers is
not significant.
