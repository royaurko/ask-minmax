We present a proposal for a X-ray optical element suitable for X-ray
microscopy and other X-ray-based display systems. Its principle is based on the
Fresnel lenses condition and the Bragg condition for X-ray scattering on a
slice of monocrystal. These conditions are fulfilled simultaneously due to a
properly machined shape of the monocrystal with a stress at its ends.
