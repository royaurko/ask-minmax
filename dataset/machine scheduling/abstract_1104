We critically assess the problem of extracting work from a coherent
superposition of energy eigenstates of an individual qubit system. By carefully
taking into account all the resources involved in the thermodynamic
transformations in a fully quantum-mechanical treatment, we show that there
exists a thermal machine that can come arbitrarily close to extracting all the
coherence as work. The machine only needs to act on individual copies of a
state and can be reused. On the other hand, we show that for any thermal
machine with finite resources not all the coherence of a state can be extracted
as work. We provide explicit protocols extracting work from coherence when the
resources of a thermal machine are bounded, a scenario potentially relevant for
the thermodynamics at the nanoscale.
