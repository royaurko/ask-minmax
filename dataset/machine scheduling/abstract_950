I examine simple tests for the presence of accretion disks in AGN - changes
of surface brightness with viewing angle, changes of colour temperature with
luminosity, and behaviour during variability. AGN observations pass the first
two tests but fail the third, unless there is some previously unobserved source
of heating - the ``ghost in the machine''.
