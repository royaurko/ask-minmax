The Fermilab Booster is a fast ramping (15Hz) synchrotron which accelerates
protons from 400MeV to 8GeV. During commissioning of a transverse digital
damper system, it was shown that the damper could provide a measurement of the
machine tune throughout the cycle by exciting just 1 of the 84 bunches with
minimal impact on the machine operation. The algorithms used to make the
measurement have been incorporated into the damper FPGA firmware allowing for
real-time tune monitoring of all Booster cycles.
