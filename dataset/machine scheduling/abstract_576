The Eureka-147 Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) standard defines the 'dynamic
labels' data field for holding information about the transmission content.
However, this information does not follow a well-defined structure since it is
designed to carry text for direct output to displays, for human interpretation.
This poses a problem when machine interpretation of DAB content information is
desired. Extensible Markup Language (XML) was developed to allow for the
well-defined, structured machine-to-machine exchange of data over computer
networks. This article proposes a novel technique of machine-interpretable DAB
content annotation and receiver hardware control, involving the utilisation of
XML as metadata in the transmitted DAB frames.
