Nowadays, it has become feasible to use mobile nodes as contributing entities
in computing systems. In this paper, we consider a computational grid in which
the mobile devices can share their idle resources to realize parallel
processing. The overall computing task can be arbitrarily partitioned into
multiple subtasks to be distributed to mobile resource providers (RPs). In this
process, the computation load scheduling problem is highlighted. Based on the
optimization objective, i.e., minimizing the task makespan, a buyer-seller
model in which the task sponsor can inspire the SPs to share their computing
resources by paying certain profits, is proposed. The Stackelberg Pricing Game
(SPG) is employed to obtain the optimal price and shared resource amount of
each SP. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm by
system simulation and the results indicate that the SPG-based load scheduling
algorithm can significantly improve the time gain in mobile grid systems.
