In this paper we consider the scheduling of periodic and parallel rigid
tasks. We provide (and prove correct) an exact schedulability test for Fixed
Task Priority (FTP) Gang scheduler sub-classes: Parallelism Monotonic, Idling,
Limited Gang, and Limited Slack Reclaiming. Additionally, we study the
predictability of our schedulers: we show that Gang FJP schedulers are not
predictable and we identify several sub-classes which are actually predictable.
Moreover, we extend the definition of rigid, moldable and malleable jobs to
recurrent tasks.
