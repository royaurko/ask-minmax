We explore the achievable delay performance in wireless random-access
networks. While relatively simple and inherently distributed in nature,
suitably designed queue-based random-access schemes provide the striking
capability to match the optimal throughput performance of centralized
scheduling mechanisms in a wide range of scenarios. The specific type of
activation rules for which throughput optimality has been established, may
however yield excessive queues and delays.
  Motivated by that issue, we examine whether the poor delay performance is
inherent to the basic operation of these schemes, or caused by the specific
kind of activation rules. We derive delay lower bounds for queue-based
activation rules, which offer fundamental insight in the cause of the excessive
delays. For fixed activation rates we obtain lower bounds indicating that
delays and mixing times can grow dramatically with the load in certain
topologies as well.
