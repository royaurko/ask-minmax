Machine Science, or Data-driven Research, is a new and interesting scientific
methodology that uses advanced computational techniques to identify, retrieve,
classify and analyse data in order to generate hypotheses and develop models.
In this paper we describe three recent biomedical Machine Science studies, and
use these to assess the current state of the art with specific emphasis on data
mining, data assessment, costs, limitations, skills and tool support.
