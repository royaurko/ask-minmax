In this work we propose a roadmap towards the analytical understanding of
Device-to-Device (D2D) communications in LTE-A networks. Various D2D solutions
have been proposed, which include inband and outband D2D transmission modes,
each of which exhibits different pros and cons in terms of complexity,
interference, and spectral efficiency achieved. We go beyond traditional mode
optimization and mode-selection schemes. Specifically, we formulate a general
problem for the joint per-user mode selection, connection activation and
resource scheduling of connections.
