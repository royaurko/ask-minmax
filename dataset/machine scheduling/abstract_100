The 2002 Trading Agent Competition (TAC) presented a challenging market game
in the domain of travel shopping. One of the pivotal issues in this domain is
uncertainty about hotel prices, which have a significant influence on the
relative cost of alternative trip schedules. Thus, virtually all participants
employ some method for predicting hotel prices. We survey approaches employed
in the tournament, finding that agents apply an interesting diversity of
techniques, taking into account differing sources of evidence bearing on
prices. Based on data provided by entrants on their agents' actual predictions
in the TAC-02 finals and semifinals, we analyze the relative efficacy of these
approaches. The results show that taking into account game-specific information
about flight prices is a major distinguishing factor. Machine learning methods
effectively induce the relationship between flight and hotel prices from game
data, and a purely analytical approach based on competitive equilibrium
analysis achieves equal accuracy with no historical data. Employing a new
measure of prediction quality, we relate absolute accuracy to bottom-line
performance in the game.
