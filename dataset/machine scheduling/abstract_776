In the first part of this paper we present the first steps towards providing
low-risk and economically feasible network data transfer services. We introduce
three types of data transfer services and present general guidelines and
algorithms for managing service prices, risks and schedules. In the second part
of the paper we solve two packet scheduling cost optimization problems and
present efficient algorithms for identifying maximum weight (k-level-)
caterpillar subtrees in tree networks.
