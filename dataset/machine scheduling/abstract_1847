In this paper we investigate the problem of localizing a mobile device based
on readings from its embedded sensors utilizing machine learning methodologies.
We consider a real-world environment, collect a large dataset of 3110
datapoints, and examine the performance of a substantial number of machine
learning algorithms in localizing a mobile device. We have found algorithms
that give a mean error as accurate as 0.76 meters, outperforming other indoor
localization systems reported in the literature. We also propose a hybrid
instance-based approach that results in a speed increase by a factor of ten
with no loss of accuracy in a live deployment over standard instance-based
methods, allowing for fast and accurate localization. Further, we determine how
smaller datasets collected with less density affect accuracy of localization,
important for use in real-world environments. Finally, we demonstrate that
these approaches are appropriate for real-world deployment by evaluating their
performance in an online, in-motion experiment.
