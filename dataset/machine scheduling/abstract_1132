The zero temperature phase diagram of a one-dimensional S=2 Heisenberg
ferromagnet with single-ion cubic anisotropy is studied numerically using the
density-matrix renormalization group method. Evidence is found that although
the model does not involve quadrupolar couplings, there is a purely quadrupolar
phase for large values of the anisotropy. The phase transition between the
magnetic and quadrupolar phases is continuous and it seems to be characterized
by Ising critical exponents.
