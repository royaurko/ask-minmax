A fully gauge-invariant (pseudoscalar) meson photoproduction amplitude off a
nucleon including the final-state interaction is derived. The approach based on
a comprehensive field-theoretical formalism developed earlier by one of the
contributors replaces certain dynamical features of the full interaction current by
phenomenological auxiliary contact currents. A procedure is outlined that
allows for a systematic improvement of this approximation. The feasibility of
the approach is illustrated by applying it to both the neutral and charged pion
photoproductions.
