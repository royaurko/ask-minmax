Machine translation is research based area where evaluation is very important
phenomenon for checking the quality of MT output. The work is based on the
evaluation of English to Urdu Machine translation. In this research work we
have evaluated the translation quality of Urdu language which has been
translated by using different Machine Translation systems like Google, Babylon
and Ijunoon. The evaluation process is done by using two approaches - Human
evaluation and Automatic evaluation. We have worked for both the approaches
where in human evaluation emphasis is given to scales and parameters while in
automatic evaluation emphasis is given to some automatic metric such as BLEU,
GTM, METEOR and ATEC.
