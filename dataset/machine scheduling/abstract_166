This paper describes a new approach to experimentally estimate the
application schedulability for various processor frequencies. We use additional
workload generated by an artificial high priority routine to simulate the
frequency decrease of a processor. Then we estimate the schedulability of
applications at different frequencies. The results of such estimation can be
used to determine the frequencies and control algorithms of dynamic voltage
scaling/dynamic frequency scaling (DVS/DFS) implementations. The paper presents
a general problem description, the proposed schedulability estimation method,
its analysis and evaluation.
