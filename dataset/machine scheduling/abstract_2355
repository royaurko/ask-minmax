This work introduces a general multi-level model for self-adaptive systems. A
self-adaptive system is seen as composed by two levels: the lower level
describing the actual behaviour of the system and the upper level accounting
for the dynamically changing environmental constraints on the system. In order
to keep our description as general as possible, the lower level is modelled as
a state machine and the upper level as a second-order state machine whose
states have associated formulas over observable variables of the lower level.
Thus, each state of the second-order machine identifies the set of lower-level
states satisfying the constraints. Adaptation is triggered when a second-order
transition is performed; this means that the current system no longer can
satisfy the current high-level constraints and, thus, it has to adapt its
behaviour by reaching a state that meets the new constraints. The semantics of
the multi-level system is given by a flattened transition system that can be
statically checked in order to prove the correctness of the adaptation model.
To this aim we formalize two concepts of weak and strong adaptability providing
both a relational and a logical characterization. We report that this work
gives a formal computational characterization of multi-level self-adaptive
systems, evidencing the important role that (theoretical) computer science
could play in the emerging science of complex systems.
