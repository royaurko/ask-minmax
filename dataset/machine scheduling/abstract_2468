I want to show situations in which causal relation of two events is entangled
and similar to time paradox, without employing time machines. Such situations
will be obtained in measurement by two measurement devices moving mutually.
According to the concept of the collapse of wave packet and the relativity of
simultaneity, the causal relation of two measurements can be entangled.
