We use the combination of the 2 Ms Chandra X-ray image, new J and H band
images, and the Spitzer IRAC and MIPS images of the Chandra Deep Field-North to
obtain high spectroscopic and photometric redshift completeness of high and
intermediate X-ray luminosity sources in the redshift interval z=2-3. We
measure the number densities of z=2-3 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and
broad-line AGNs in the rest-frame 2-8 keV luminosity intervals 10^44-10^45 and
10^43-10^44 ergs/s and compare with previous lower redshift results. We confirm
a decline in the number densities of intermediate-luminosity sources at z>1. We
also measure the number density of z=2-3 AGNs in the luminosity interval
10^43-10^44.5 ergs/s and compare with previous low and high-redshift results.
Again, we find a decline in the number densities at z>1. In both cases, we can
rule out the hypothesis that the number densities remain flat to z=2-3 at above
the 5-sigma level.
