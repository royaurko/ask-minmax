In this paper we consider two problems regarding the scheduling of available
personnel in order to perform a given quantity of work, which can be
arbitrarily decomposed into a sequence of activities. We are interested in
schedules which minimize the overall dissatisfaction, where each employee's
dissatisfaction is modeled as a time-dependent linear function. For the two
situations considered we provide a detailed mathematical analysis, as well as
efficient algorithms for determining optimal schedules.
