Baseline calibration of a stellar interferometer is a prerequisite to data
reduction of astrometric operations. This technique of astrometry is
triangulation of star positions. Since angles are deduced from the baseline and
delay side of these triangles, length and pointing direction (in the celestial
sphere) of the baseline vector at the time of observation are key input data.
We assume that calibration follows from reverse astrometry; a set of calibrator
stars with well-known positions is observed and inaccuracies in these positions
are leveled by observing many of them for a common best fit.
  The errors in baseline length and orientation angles drop proportional to the
inverse square roots of the number of independent data taken, proportional to
the errors in the individual snapshots of the delay, and proportional to the
errors in the apparent positions of the calibrators. Scheduling becomes
important if the baseline components are reconstructed from the sinusoidal
delay of a single calibrator as a function of time.
