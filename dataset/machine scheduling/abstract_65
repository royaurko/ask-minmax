The CP-PACS computer with a peak speed of 300 Gflops was completed in March
1996 and has started to operate. We describe the final specification and the
hardware implementation of the CP-PACS computer, and its performance for QCD
codes. A plan of the grade-up of the computer scheduled for fall of 1996 is
also given.
