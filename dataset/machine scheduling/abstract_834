The Offline Software of the CMS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
at CERN consists of 6M lines of in-house code, developed over a decade by
nearly 1000 physicists, as well as a comparable amount of general use
open-source code. A critical ingredient to the success of the construction and
early operation of the WLCG was the convergence, around the year 2000, on the
use of a homogeneous environment of commodity x86-64 processors and Linux.
Apache Mesos is a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation
and sharing across distributed applications, or frameworks. It can run Hadoop,
Jenkins, Spark, Aurora, and other applications on a dynamically shared pool of
nodes. We present how we migrated our continuos integration system to schedule
jobs on a relatively small Apache Mesos enabled cluster and how this resulted
in better resource usage, higher peak performance and lower latency thanks to
the dynamic scheduling capabilities of Mesos.
