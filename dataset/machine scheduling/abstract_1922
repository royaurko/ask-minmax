An unsupervised software ``robot'' that automatically and robustly reduces
and analyzes CCD observations of photometric standard stars is described. The
robot measures extinction coefficients and other photometric parameters in real
time and, more carefully, on the next day. It also reduces and analyzes data
from an all-sky $10 \mu m$ camera to detect clouds; photometric data taken
during cloudy periods are automatically rejected. The robot reports its
findings back to observers and data analysts via the World-Wide Web. It can be
used to assess photometricity, and to build data on site conditions. The
robot's automated and uniform site monitoring represents a minimum standard for
any observing site with queue scheduling, a public data archive, or likely
participation in any future National Virtual Observatory.
