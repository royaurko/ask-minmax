We consider the job-shop problem with sequence-dependent setup times. We
focus on the formal definition of schedule generation schemes (SGSs) based on
the semi-active, active, and non-delay schedule categories. We study dominance
properties of the sets of schedules obtainable with each SGS. We show how the
proposed SGSs can be used within single-pass and multi-pass priority rule based
heuristics. We study several priority rules for the problem and provide a
comparative computational analysis of the different SGSs on sets of instances
taken from the literature. The proposed SGSs significantly improve previously
best-known results on a set of hard benchmark instances.
