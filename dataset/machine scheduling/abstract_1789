One of the most significant developments in the history of human being is the
invention of a way of keeping records of human knowledge, thoughts and ideas.
In 1926, the work of several thinkers such as Edouard Le Roy, Vladimir
Vernadsky and Teilhard de Chardin led to the concept of noosphere, thus the
idea that human cognition and knowledge transforms the biosphere coming to be
something like the planet's thinking layer. At present, is commonly accepted by
some thinkers that the Internet is the medium that brings life to noosphere.
According to Vinge and Kurzweil's technological singularity hypothesis,
noosphere would be in the future the natural environment in which
'human-machine superintelligence' emerges after to reach the point of
technological singularity. In this paper we show by means of a numerical model
the impossibility that our civilization reaches the point of technological
singularity in the near future. We propose that this point may be reached when
Internet data centers are based on "computer machines" to be more effective in
terms of power consumption than current ones. We speculate about what we have
called 'Nooscomputer' or N-computer a hypothetical machine which would consume
far less power allowing our civilization to reach the point of technological
singularity.
