We formulate the concept of time machine structure for spacetimes exhibiting
a compactely constructed region with closed timelike curves. After reviewing
essential properties of the pseudo Schwarzschild spacetime introduced by A.
Ori, we present an analysis of its geodesics analogous to the one conducted in
the case of the Schwarzschild spacetime. We conclude that the pseudo
Schwarzschild spacetime is geodesically incomplete and not extendible to a
complete spacetime. We then introduce a rotating generalization of the pseudo
Schwarzschild metric, which we call the the pseudo Kerr spacetime. We establish
its time machine structure and analyze its global properties.
