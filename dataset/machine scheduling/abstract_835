In this paper the performance of INET's emulation mode is evaluated. In
particular, the focus of the study is on the precision of the delay emulation.
It is shown, that this precision is low in INET 2.6 (respectively a later
version provided in the integration branch that fixed the crashes of 2.6 in
emulation mode). Two errors in the implementation are identified and an
alternative configuration for packet capturing is proposed. The performance
tests are re-run with such a modified version of the real-time scheduler (which
is now included in the recent INET 3.0 release) and it is shown that the
responsiveness of the emulation mode and the precision of delay emulation are
improved significantly. Finally, the negative impact of the modified capturing
configuration is briefly analyzed. Packet loss in the capturing process has
deteriorated but in fact is has already plagued the emulation mode of previous
implementations and this topic clearly demands for further studies.
