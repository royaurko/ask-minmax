It has been shown by A.-L. Barabasi that the priority based scheduling rules
in single stage queuing systems (QS) generates fat tail behavior for the tasks
waiting time distributions (WTD). Such fat tails are due to the waiting times
of very low priority tasks which stay unserved almost forever as the task
priority indices (PI) are "frozen in time" (i.e. a task priority is assigned
once for all to each incoming task). Relaxing the "frozen in time" assumption,
this paper studies the new dynamic behavior expected when the priority of each
incoming tasks is time-dependent (i.e. "aging mechanisms" are allowed). For two
class of models, namely 1) a population type model with an age structure and 2)
a QS with deadlines assigned to the incoming tasks which is operated under the
"earliest-deadline-first" policy, we are able to analytically extract some
relevant characteristics of the the tasks waiting time distribution. As the
aging mechanism ultimately assign high priority to any long waiting tasks, fat
tails in the WTD cannot find their origin in the scheduling rule alone thus
showing a fundamental difference between the present and the A.-L. Barabasi's
class of models.
