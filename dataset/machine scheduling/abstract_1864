We study distributed stochastic convex optimization under the delayed
gradient model where the server nodes perform parameter updates, while the
worker nodes compute stochastic gradients. We discuss, analyze, and experiment
with a setup motivated by the behavior of real-world distributed computation
networks, where the machines are differently slow at different time. Therefore,
we allow the parameter updates to be sensitive to the actual delays
experienced, rather than to worst-case bounds on the maximum delay. This
sensitivity leads to larger stepsizes, that can help gain rapid initial
convergence without having to wait too long for slower machines, while
maintaining the same asymptotic complexity. We obtain encouraging improvements
to overall convergence for distributed experiments on real datasets with up to
billions of examples and features.
