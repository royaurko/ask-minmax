This paper presents a solution to efficiently explore the design space of
communication adapters. In most digital signal processing (DSP) applications,
the overall architecture of the system is significantly affected by
communication architecture, so the designers need specifically optimized
adapters. By explicitly modeling these communications within an effective
graph-theoretic model and analysis framework, we automatically generate an
optimized architecture, named Space-Time AdapteR (STAR). Our design flow inputs
a C description of Input/Output data scheduling, and user requirements
(throughput, latency, parallelism...), and formalizes communication constraints
through a Resource Constraints Graph (RCG). The RCG properties enable an
efficient architecture space exploration in order to synthesize a STAR
component. The proposed approach has been tested to design an industrial data
mixing block example: an Ultra-Wideband interleaver.
