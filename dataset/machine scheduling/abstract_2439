We propose a very simple one-dimensional swimmer consisting of three spheres
that are linked by rigid rods whose lengths can change between two values. With
a periodic motion in a non-reciprocal fashion, which breaks the time-reversal
symmetry as well as the translational symmetry, we show that the model device
can swim at low Reynolds number. This model system could be used in
constructing molecular-size machines.
