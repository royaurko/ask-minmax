IEEE specifies different modulation techniques for WiMAX; namely, BPSK, QPSK,
16 QAM and 64 QAM. This paper studies the performance of Internet Protocol
Television (IPTV) over Fixed WiMAX system considering different combinations of
digital modulation. The performance is studied taking into account a number of
key system parameters which include the variation in the video coding,
path-loss, scheduling service classes different rated codes in FEC channel
coding. The performance study was conducted using OPNET simulation. The
performance is studied in terms of packet lost, packet jitter delay, end-to-end
delay, and network throughput. Simulation results show that higher order
modulation and coding schemes (namely, 16 QAM and 64 QAM) yield better
performance than that of QPSK.
