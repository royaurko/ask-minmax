Audio effect implementation on random musical signal is a basic application
of digital signal processors. In this paper, the compatibility features of
MATLAB R2008a with Code Composer Studio 3.3 has been exploited to develop
Simulink models which when emulated on TMS320C6713 DSK generate real time audio
effects. Each design has been done by two different asynchronous scheduling
techniques: (i) Idle task Scheduling and (ii) DSP/BIOS task Scheduling. A basic
COCOMO analysis has been done for the generated code to justify the industrial
viability of this design approach.
