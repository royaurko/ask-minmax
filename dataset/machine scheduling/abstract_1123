A new family of planets is considered which is between rochy terrestrial
planets and gaseous giant ones: "Ocean-Planets". We present the possible
formation, composition and internal models of these putative planets, including
that of their ocean, as well as their possible Exobiology interest. These
planets should be detectable by planet detection missions such as Eddington and
Kepler, and possibly COROT (lauch scheduled in 2006). They would be ideal
targets for spectroscopic missions such as Darwin/TPF.
