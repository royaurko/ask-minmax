The stability region of the two-user broadcast channel is characterized in
this paper. We obtain the stability region in the general case and we provide
convexity/concavity conditions to characterize the superiority of parallel
concurrent transmissions compared to scheduled access. Furthermore, we consider
the particular case where each receiver treats the interfering signal as noise,
as well as the case where the transmitter sends the packets using superposition
coding and successive decoding is employed at the strong receiver.
