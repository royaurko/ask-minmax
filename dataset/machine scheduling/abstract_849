The QCDSP machines were designed for lattice gauge calculations. For planning
it is crucial to explore this architecture for other computationally intensive
tasks. Here I describe an implementation of a simple message passing scheme.
With the objective being simplicity, I introduce a small number of generic
functions for manipulating a large data set spread over the machine. I test the
scheme on three applications: a fast Fourier transform, arbitrary dimension
SU(N) pure lattice gauge theory, and the manipulation of Fermionic Fock states
through a distributed hash table. These routines compile both on QCDSP and a
Unix workstation.
