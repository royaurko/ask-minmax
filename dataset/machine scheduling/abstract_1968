This paper deals with the problem of analytically computing the largest
Lyapunov exponent for many degrees of freedom Hamiltonian systems. This aim is
succesfully reached within a theoretical framework that makes use of a
geometrization of newtonian dynamics in the language of Riemannian geometry. A
new point of view about the origin of chaos in these systems is obtained
independently of homoclinic intersections. Chaos is here related to curvature
fluctuations of the manifolds whose geodesics are natural motions and is
described by means of Jacobi equation for geodesic spread. Under general
conditions ane effective stability equation is derived; an analytic formula for
the growth-rate of its solutions is worked out and applied to the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam beta model and to a chain of coupled rotators. An excellent
agreement is found the theoretical prediction and the values of the Lyapunov
exponent obtained by numerical simulations for both models.
