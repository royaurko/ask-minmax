We add probabilistic features to basic thread algebra and its extensions with
thread-service interaction and strategic interleaving. Here, threads represent
the behaviours produced by instruction sequences under execution and services
represent the behaviours exhibited by the components of execution environments
of instruction sequences. In a paper concerned with probabilistic instruction
sequences, we proposed several kinds of probabilistic instructions and gave an
informal explanation for each of them. The probabilistic features added to the
extension of basic thread algebra with thread-service interaction make it
possible to give a formal explanation in terms of non-probabilistic
instructions and probabilistic services. The probabilistic features added to
the extensions of basic thread algebra with strategic interleaving make it
possible to cover strategies corresponding to probabilistic scheduling
algorithms.
