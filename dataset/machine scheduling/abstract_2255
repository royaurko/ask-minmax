We define an extension of time Petri nets such that the time at which a
transition can fire, also called its firing date, may be dynamically updated.
Our extension provides two mechanisms for updating the timing constraints of a
net. First, we propose to change the static time interval of a transition each
time it is newly enabled; in this case the new time interval is given as a
function of the current marking. Next, we allow to update the firing date of a
transition when it is persistent, that is when a concurrent transition fires.
We show how to carry the widely used state class abstraction to this new kind
of time Petri nets and define a class of nets for which the abstraction is
exact. We show the usefulness of our approach with two applications: first for
scheduling preemptive task, as a poor man's substitute for stopwatch, then to
model hybrid systems with non trivial continuous behavior.
