Channel-dependent scheduling of transmission of data packets in a wireless
system is based on measurement and feedback of the channel quality. To
alleviate the performance degradation due to simultaneous multiple imperfect
channel quality information (CQI), a simple and efficient packet scheduling
(PS) algorithm is developed in downlink LTE system for real time traffic. A
frequency domain channel predictor based on Kalman filter is first developed to
restore the true CQI from erroneous channel quality feedback. Then, a time
domain grouping technique employing the joint of Proportional Fair (PF) and
Modified Largest Weighted Delay First (M-LWDF) algorithms is used. It was
proved this proposal achieves better performance in terms of system throughput
and packet loss ratio by simulation results.
