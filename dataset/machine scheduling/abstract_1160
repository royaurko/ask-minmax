Following recent work in which events which may correspond to a bound
tetraneutron ($^4$n) were observed, it is pointed out that from the theoretical
perspective the two-body nucleon-nucleon (NN) force cannot by itself bind four
neutrons, even if it could bind a dineutron. Unrealistic modifications of the
NN force or introduction of unreaslistic four-nucleon force would be needed in
order to bind the tetraneutron. The existence of other multineutron systems is
discussed.
