In the literature of Round-Robin scheduling scheme, each job is processed,
one after the another after giving a fix quantum. In case of First-come
first-served, each process is executed, if the previously arrived processed is
completed. Both these scheduling schemes are used in this paper as its special
cases. A Markov chain model is used to compare several scheduling schemes of
the class. An index measure is defined to compare the model based efficiency of
different scheduling schemes. One scheduling scheme which is the mixture of
FIFO and round robin is found efficient in terms of model based study. The
system simulation procedure is used to derive the conclusion of the content
