Text Document classification aims in associating one or more predefined
categories based on the likelihood suggested by the training set of labeled
documents. Many machine learning algorithms play a vital role in training the
system with predefined categories among which Na\"ive Bayes has some intriguing
facts that it is simple, easy to implement and draws better accuracy in large
datasets in spite of the na\"ive dependence. The importance of Na\"ive Bayes
Machine learning approach has felt hence the study has been taken up for text
document classification and the statistical event models available. This survey
the various feature selection methods has been discussed and compared along
with the metrics related to text document classification.
