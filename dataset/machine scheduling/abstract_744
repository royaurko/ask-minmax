Derivatives, mostly in the form of gradients and Hessians, are ubiquitous in
machine learning. Automatic differentiation (AD) is a technique for calculating
derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs efficiently and
accurately, used in fields such as computational fluid dynamics, nuclear
engineering, and atmospheric sciences. Despite its advantages and use in other
fields, machine learning practitioners have been little influenced by AD and
make scant use of available tools. We survey the intersection of AD and machine
learning, cover applications where AD has the potential to make a big impact,
and report on some recent developments in the adoption of this technique. We
aim to dispel some misconceptions that we contend have impeded the use of AD
within the machine learning community.
