Infrared OH lines at 1.55 - 1.56 um in the H-band were obtained with the
Phoenix high-resolution spectrograph at the 2.1m telescope of the Kitt Peak
National Observatory for a sample of 14 metal-poor stars. Detailed analyses of
the sample stars have been carried out, deriving stellar parameters based on
two methods: (a) spectroscopic parameters; (b) IRFM effective temperatures,
trigonometric gravities and metallicities from Fe II lines. The Fe I lines
present in the H-band region observed showed to be well fitted by the stellar
parameters within $\Delta$[Fe/H] < 0.15 dex. The oxygen abundances were derived
from fits of spectrum synthesis calculations to the infrared OH lines. CO lines
in the H- and K-bands were obtained for a subsample in order to determine their
carbon abundances. Adopting the spectroscopic parameters a mean oxygen-to-iron
ratio of [O/Fe] ~ +0.52 is obtained, whereas using the IRFM temperatures,
Hipparcos gravities and [FeII/H], [O/Fe] ~ +0.25 is found. A mean of the two
methods gives a final value of [O/Fe] ~ +0.4 for the metallicity range -2.2 <
[Fe/H] < -1.2 of the sample metal-poor stars.
