A remarkable new definition of a self-delimiting universal Turing machine is
presented that is easy to program and runs very quickly. This provides a new
foundation for algorithmic information theory. This new universal Turing
machine is implemented via software written in Mathematica and C. Using this
new software, it is now possible to give a self-contained ``hands on''
mini-course presenting very concretely the latest proofs of the fundamental
information-theoretic incompleteness theorems.
