In anonymous broadcast, one or more parties want to anonymously send messages
to all parties. This problem is increasingly important as a black-box in many
privacy-preserving applications such as anonymous communication, distributed
auctions, and multi-party computation. In this paper, we design decentralized
protocols for anonymous broadcast that require each party to send (and compute)
a polylogarithmic number of bits (and operations) per anonymous bit delivered
with $O(\log n)$ rounds of communication. Our protocol is provably secure
against traffic analysis, does not require any trusted party, and is completely
load-balanced. The protocol tolerates up to $n/6$ statically-scheduled
Byzantine parties that are controlled by a computationally unbounded adversary.
Our main strategy for achieving scalability is to perform local communications
(and computations) among a logarithmic number of parties. We provide simulation
results to show that our protocol improves significantly over previous work. We
finally show that using a common cryptographic tool in our protocol one can
achieve practical results for anonymous broadcast.
