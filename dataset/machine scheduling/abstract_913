We graft synchronization onto Girard's Geometry of Interaction in its most
concrete form, namely token machines. This is realized by introducing
proof-nets for SMLL, an extension of multiplicative linear logic with a
specific construct modeling synchronization points, and of a multi-token
abstract machine model for it. Interestingly, the correctness criterion ensures
the absence of deadlocks along reduction and in the underlying machine, this
way linking logical and operational properties.
