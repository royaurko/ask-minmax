We have used a dc Superconducting QUantum Interference Device to measure the
magnetic flux noise generated by the equilibrium vortex density fluctuations
associated with the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii (KTB) transition in an
overdamped Josephson junction array. At temperatures slightly above the KTB
transition temperature, the noise is white for $f<f_\xi$ and scales as $1/f$
for $f>f_\xi$. Here $f_\xi\propto\xi^{-z}$, where $\xi$ is the correlation
length and $z$ is the dynamic exponent. Moreover, when all frequencies are
scaled by $f_\xi$, data for different temperatures and frequencies collapse on
to a single curve. In addition, we have extracted the dynamic exponent $z$ and
found $z=1.98\pm0.03$.
