We give upper concentration bounds for martingales that are uniform over
finite times and extend classical Hoeffding and Bernstein bounds. They shed
light on the relationship between the central limit theorem and the law of the
iterated logarithm in finite time. We also prove our upper bounds to be optimal
in a strong sense with a lower bound.
