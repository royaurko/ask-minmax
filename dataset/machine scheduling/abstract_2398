Forecasts of prospective criminal behavior have long been an important
feature of many criminal justice decisions. There is now substantial evidence
that machine learning procedures will classify and forecast at least as well,
and typically better, than logistic regression, which has to date dominated
conventional practice. However, machine learning procedures are adaptive. They
"learn" inductively from training data. As a result, they typically perform
best with very large datasets. There is a need, therefore, for forecasting
procedures with the promise of machine learning that will perform well with
small to moderately-sized datasets. Kernel methods provide precisely that
promise. In this paper, we offer an overview of kernel methods in regression
settings and compare such a method, regularized with principle components, to
stepwise logistic regression. We apply both to a timely and important criminal
justice concern: a failure to appear (FTA) at court proceedings following an
arraignment. A forecast of an FTA can be an important factor is a judge's
decision to release a defendant while awaiting trial and can influence the
conditions imposed on that release. Forecasting accuracy matters, and our
kernel approach forecasts far more accurately than stepwise logistic
regression. The methods developed here are implemented in the R package kernReg
currently available on CRAN.
