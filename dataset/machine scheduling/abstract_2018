A new reactor power plant Shika-2, with a power of approximately 4 GW and at
a distance of about 88 km from the KamLAND detector is scheduled to start
operating in March 2006. We study the impact of the $\bar\nu_e$ flux from this
reactor on the sensitivity of the KamLAND experiment to the solar neutrino
oscillation parameters. We present results on prospective determination of
$\Delta m^2_\odot$ and $\sin^2\theta_\odot$ using the combined data from
KamLAND and the solar neutrino experiments, including the effect of the Shika-2
contribution to the KamLAND signal and the latest data from the salt enriched
phase of the SNO experiment. We find that contrary to the expectations, the
addition of the Shika-2 reactor flux does not improve the $\sin^2\theta_\odot$
sensitivity of KamLAND, while the ambiguity in $\Delta m^2_\odot$ measurement
may even increase, as a result of the averaging effect between Kashiwazaki and
the Shika-2 reactor contributions to the KamLAND signal.
