Over the past two decades, Yuri Gurevich and his colleagues have formulated
axiomatic foundations for the notion of algorithm, be it classical,
interactive, or parallel, and formalized them in the new generic framework of
abstract state machines. This approach has recently been extended to suggest a
formalization of the notion of effective computation over arbitrary countable
domains. The central notions are summarized herein.
