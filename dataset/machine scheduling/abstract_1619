The use of last generation Programmable Electronic Components makes possible
the construction of very powerful and competitive special purpose computers. We
have designed, constructed and tested a three-dimensional Spin Glass model
dedicated machine, which consists of 12 identical boards. Each single board can
simulate 8 different systems, updating all the systems at every clock cycle.
The update speed of the whole machine is 217ps/spin with 48 MHz clock
frequency. A device devoted to fast random number generation has been developed
and included in every board. The on-board reprogrammability permits us to
change easily the lattice size, or even the update algorithm or the action. We
present here a detailed description of the machine and the first runs using the
Heat Bath algorithm.
