The optimal phase covariant cloning machine (PQCM) broadcasts the information
associated to an input qubit into a multi-qubit systems, exploiting a partial
a-priori knowledge of the input state. This additional a priori information
leads to a higher fidelity than for the universal cloning. The present article
first analyzes different experimental schemes to implement the 1->3 PQCM. The
method is then generalized to any 1->M machine for odd value of M by a
theoretical approach based on the general angular momentum formalism. Finally
different experimental schemes based either on linear or non-linear methods and
valid for single photon polarization encoded qubits are discussed.
