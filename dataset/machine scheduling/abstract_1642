We introduce a strict version of the concept of a load/store instruction set
architecture in the setting of Maurer machines. We take the view that
transformations on the states of a Maurer machine are achieved by applying
threads as considered in thread algebra to the Maurer machine. We study how the
transformations on the states of the main memory of a strict load/store
instruction set architecture that can be achieved by applying threads depend on
the operating unit size, the cardinality of the instruction set, and the
maximal number of states of the threads.
