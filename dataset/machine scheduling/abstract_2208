In this letter, we focus on the performance of a worst-case mobile user (MU)
in the downlink cellular network. We derive the coverage probability and the
spectral efficiency of the worst-case MU using stochastic geometry. Through
analytical and numerical results, we draw out interesting insights that the
coverage probability and the spectral efficiency of the worst-case MU decrease
down to 23% and 19% of those of a typical MU, respectively. By applying a
coordinated scheduling (CS) scheme, we also investigate how much the
performance of the worst-case MU is improved.
