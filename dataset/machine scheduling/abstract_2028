In a previous publication [Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables 75, 1 (2000)],
we had given seven parameter analytical fits to theoretical reaction rates
derived from nuclear cross sections calculated in the statistical model
(Hauser-Feshbach formalism) for targets with 9<Z<84 (Ne to Bi) and for a mass
range reaching the neutron and proton driplines. Reactions considered were
(n,gamma), (n,p), (n,alpha), (p,gamma), (p,alpha), (alpha,gamma), and their
inverse reactions. On public demand, we present here the theoretical nuclear
cross sections and astrophysical reaction rates from which those rate fits were
derived, and we provide these data as on-line electronic files. Corresponding
to the fitted rates, two complete data sets are provided, one of which includes
a phenomenological treatment of shell quenching for neutron-rich nuclei.
