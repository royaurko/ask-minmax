We study opportunistic scheduling and the sum capacity of cellular networks
with a full-duplex multi-antenna base station and a large number of
single-antenna half-duplex users. Simultaneous uplink and downlink over the
same band results in uplink-to-downlink interference, degrading performance. We
present a simple opportunistic joint uplink-downlink scheduling algorithm that
exploits multiuser diversity and treats interference as noise. We show that in
homogeneous networks, our algorithm achieves the same sum capacity as what
would have been achieved if there was no uplink-to-downlink interference,
asymptotically in the number of users. The algorithm does not require
interference CSI at the base station or uplink users. It is also shown that for
a simple class of heterogeneous networks without sufficient channel diversity,
it is not possible to achieve the corresponding interference-free system
capacity. We discuss the potential for using device-to-device side-channels to
overcome this limitation in heterogeneous networks.
