Quantitative model checkers for Markov Decision Processes typically use
finite-precision arithmetic. If all the coefficients in the process are
rational numbers, then the model checking results are rational, and so they can
be computed exactly. However, exact techniques are generally too expensive or
limited in scalability. In this paper we propose a method for obtaining exact
results starting from an approximated solution in finite-precision arithmetic.
The input of the method is a description of a scheduler, which can be obtained
by a model checker using finite precision. Given a scheduler, we show how to
obtain a corresponding basis in a linear-programming problem, in such a way
that the basis is optimal whenever the scheduler attains the worst-case
probability. This correspondence is already known for discounted MDPs, we show
how to apply it in the undiscounted case provided that some preprocessing is
done. Using the correspondence, the linear-programming problem can be solved in
exact arithmetic starting from the basis obtained. As a consequence, the method
finds the worst-case probability even if the scheduler provided by the model
checker was not optimal. In our experiments, the calculation of exact solutions
from a candidate scheduler is significantly faster than the calculation using
the simplex method under exact arithmetic starting from a default basis.
