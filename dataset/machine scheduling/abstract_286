Multi-user multi-input-multi-output (MU-MIMO) systems transmit data to
multiple users simultaneously using the spatial degrees of freedom with user
feedback channel state information (CSI). Most of the existing literatures on
the reduced feedback user scheduling focus on the throughput performance and
the user queueing delay is usually ignored. As the delay is very important for
real-time applications, a low feedback queue-aware user scheduling algorithm is
desired for the MU-MIMO system. This paper proposed a two-stage queue-aware
user scheduling algorithm, which consists of a queue-aware mobile-driven
feedback filtering stage and a SINR-based user scheduling stage, where the
feedback filtering policy is obtained from the solution of an optimization
problem. We evaluate the queueing performance of the proposed scheduling
algorithm by using the sample path large deviation analysis. We show that the
large deviation decay rate for the proposed algorithm is much larger than that
of the CSI-only user scheduling algorithm. The numerical results also
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs much better than the CSI-only
algorithm requiring only a small amount of feedback.
