Nondeterministic polynomial-time Blum-Shub-Smale Machines over the reals give
rise to a discrete complexity class between NP and PSPACE. Several problems,
mostly from real algebraic geometry / polynomial systems, have been shown
complete (under many-one reduction by polynomial-time Turing machines) for this
class. We exhibit a new one based on questions about expressions built from
cross products only.
