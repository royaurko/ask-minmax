A machine translation system is said to be *complete* if all expressions that
are correct according to the source-language grammar can be translated into the
target language. This paper addresses the completeness issue for compositional
machine translation in general, and for compositional machine translation of
context-free grammars in particular. Conditions that guarantee translation
completeness of context-free grammars are presented.
