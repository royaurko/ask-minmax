A high performance Beowulf (PC cluster) machine installed with Linux
operating system and MPI (Message Passing Interface) for interprocessor
communications has been constructed using Gigabit Ethernet and the
communication software GAMMA (Genoa Active Message Machine), instead of the
standard TCP/IP protocol. Fast C/Fortran compilers have been exploited with the
GAMMA communication libraries. This method has eliminated large communication
overhead of TCP/IP and resulted in significant increase in the computational
performance of real application programs including the first-principle
molecular dynamics simulation code. Scalability on the number of processors and
reliability over a long period of time (days) have also been confirmed for the
GAMMA communications.
