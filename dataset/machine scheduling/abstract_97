An analysis of experimental data from the RFX (Reversed Field eXperiment)
reversed field pinch machine [L. Fellin, P. Kusstatscher and G. Rostagni,
Fusion Eng. Des. {\bf 25}, 315 (1995)] is carried out to investigate the
possible existence of deterministic chaos in the edge plasma region. The
mathematical tools used include Lyapunov exponents, Kaplan-Yorke dimension,
minimum embedding dimension estimates and nonlinear forecasting. The whole
analysis agrees in ruling out the possibility of low-dimensional chaos: The
dimension of the underlying dynamical system is estimated to be $ > 10$. From a
critical re-reading of the literature it emerges that the findings of this
work are likely to be common to all reversed field pinches.
