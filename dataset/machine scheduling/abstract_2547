Schervish (1985b) showed that every forecasting system is noncalibrated for
uncountably many data sequences that it might see. This result is strengthened
here: from a topological point of view, failure of calibration is typical and
calibration rare. Meanwhile, Bayesian forecasters are certain that they are
calibrated---this invites worries about the connection between Bayesianism and
rationality.
