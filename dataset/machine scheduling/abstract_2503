Twitter messages often contain so-called hashtags to denote keywords related
to them. Using a dataset of 29 million messages, I explore relations among
these hashtags with respect to co-occurrences. Furthermore, I present an
attempt to classify hashtags into five intuitive classes, using a
machine-learning approach. The overall outcome is an interactive Web
application to explore Twitter hashtags.
