Baker and Cirinei introduced an exact but naive algorithm, based on solving a
state reachability problem in a finite automaton, to check whether sets of
sporadic hard real-time tasks are schedulable on identical multiprocessor
platforms. However, the algorithm suffered from poor performance due to the
exponential size of the automaton relative to the size of the task set. In this
paper, we successfully apply techniques developed by the formal verification
community, specifically antichain algorithms, by defining and proving the
correctness of a simulation relation on Baker and Cirinei's automaton. We show
our improved algorithm yields dramatically improved performance for the
schedulability test and opens for many further improvements.
