We present results for the performance of QCD code on ALiCE, the Alpha-Linux
Cluster Engine at Wuppertal. We describe the techniques employed to optimise
the code, including the metaprogramming of assembler kernels, the effects of
data layout and an investigation into the overheads incurred by the
communication.
