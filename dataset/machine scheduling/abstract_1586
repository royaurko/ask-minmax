In this paper we discuss an application of machine learning based methods to
the identification of candidate AGN from optical survey data and to the
automatic classification of AGNs in broad classes. We applied four different
machine learning algorithms, namely the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), trained
respectively with the Conjugate Gradient, Scaled Conjugate Gradient and Quasi
Newton learning rules, and the Support Vector Machines (SVM), to tackle the
problem of the classification of emission line galaxies in different classes,
mainly AGNs vs non-AGNs, obtained using optical photometry in place of the
diagnostics based on line intensity ratios which are classically used in the
literature. Using the same photometric features we discuss also the behavior of
the classifiers on finer AGN classification tasks, namely Seyfert I vs Seyfert
II and Seyfert vs LINER. Furthermore we describe the algorithms employed, the
samples of spectroscopically classified galaxies used to train the algorithms,
the procedure followed to select the photometric parameters and the
performances of our methods in terms of multiple statistical indicators. The
results of the experiments show that the application of self adaptive data
mining algorithms trained on spectroscopic data sets and applied to carefully
chosen photometric parameters represents a viable alternative to the classical
methods that employ time-consuming spectroscopic observations.
