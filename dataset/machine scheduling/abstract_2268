Massive multiple-input multiple-output (Massive MIMO) has been realized as a
promising technology for next generation wireless mobile communications, in
which Spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) are two critical
issues. Prior estimates have indicated that 57% energy of the cellular system
need to be supplied by the operator, especially to feed the base station (BS).
While varies scheduling studies concerned on the user equipment (UE) to reduce
the total energy consumption instead of BS. Fewer literatures address EE issues
from a BS perspective. In this paper, an EE scheme is proposed by reducing the
energy consumption of BS. The transmission model and parameters related to EE
is formulated first. Afterwards, an cellular partition zooming (CPZ) scheme is
proposed where the BS can zoom in to maintain the coverage area. Specifically,
if no user exists in the rare area of the coverage, BS will zoom out to sleep
mode to save energy. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that CPZ has
better EE performance with negligible impact on transmission rate.
