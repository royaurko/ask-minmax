Markov decision processes (MDP) are useful to model optimisation problems in
concurrent systems. To verify MDPs with efficient Monte Carlo techniques
requires that their nondeterminism be resolved by a scheduler. Recent work has
introduced the elements of lightweight techniques to sample directly from
scheduler space, but finding optimal schedulers by simple sampling may be
inefficient. Here we describe "smart" sampling algorithms that can make
substantial improvements in performance.
