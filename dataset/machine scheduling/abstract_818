To meet the increasing demand for wireless capacity, future networks are
likely to consist of dense layouts of small cells. The number of users in each
cell is thus reduced which results in diminished gains from opportunistic
scheduling, particularly under dynamic traffic loads. We propose an
user-initiated base station (BS)-transparent traffic spreading approach that
leverages user-user communication to increase BS scheduling flexibility. The
proposed scheme can increase opportunistic gain and improve user performance.
For a specified tradeoff between performance and power expenditure, we
characterize the optimal policy by modeling the system as a Markov decision
process and also present a heuristic algorithm that yields significant
performance gains. Our simulations show that, in the performance-centric case,
average file transfer delays are lowered by up to 20% even in homogeneous
scenarios, and up to 50% with heterogeneous users. Further, we show that the
bulk of the performance improvement can be achieved with a small increase in
power expenditure, e.g., in an energy-sensitive case, up to 78% of the
performance improvement can be typically achieved at only 20% of the power
expenditure of the performance-centric case.
