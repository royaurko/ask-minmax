We study and compare in two degree-theoretic ways (iterated Halting oracles
analogous to Kleene's arithmetical hierarchy and the Borel hierarchy of
descriptive set theory) the capabilities and limitations of three models of
analytic computation: BSS machines (aka real-RAM) and strongly/weakly analytic
machines as introduced by Hotz et. al. (1995).
