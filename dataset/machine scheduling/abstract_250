Android mobile operating system which is based on Linux Kernel 2.6, has open
source license and adaptability to user driven applications. As all other
operating systems it has all the basic features like process scheduling, memory
management, process management etc associated with it. Any mobile platform
works smoothly when the process scheduling is performed in a proper way. Ideal
platform is that in which no resource conflict occurs. Thus scheduling in every
manner is essential for the operating system to adapt itself with the
requirement of a particular application. In this paper, priority based
pre-emptive task scheduling is proposed for the SMS application. The idea is to
define High priority to required contacts, for ex. Contact numbers of parents
or teachers will be given High priority. If in case, any SMS from these High
priority contacts is received, the application would flash the SMS on the
active screen and redirect this High priority SMS to the Priority Inbox.
