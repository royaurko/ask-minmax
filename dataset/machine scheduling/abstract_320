The correctness of most randomized distributed algorithms is expressed by a
statement of the form ``some predicate of the executions holds with high
probability, regardless of the order in which actions are scheduled''. In this
paper, we present a general methodology to prove correctness statements of such
randomized algorithms. Specifically, we show how to prove such statements by a
series of refinements, which terminate in a statement independent of the
schedule. To demonstrate the subtlety of the issues involved in this type of
analysis, we focus on Rabin's randomized distributed algorithm for mutual
exclusion [Rabin 82]. Surprisingly, it turns out that the algorithm does not
maintain one of the requirements of the problem under a certain schedule. In
particular, we give a schedule under which a set of processes can suffer
lockout for arbitrary long periods.
