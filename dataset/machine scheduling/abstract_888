We show that deterministic finite automata equipped with $k$ two-way heads
are equivalent to deterministic machines with a single two-way input head and
$k-1$ linearly bounded counters if the accepted language is strictly bounded,
i.e., a subset of $a_1^*a_2^*... a_m^*$ for a fixed sequence of symbols $a_1,
a_2,..., a_m$. Then we investigate linear speed-up for counter machines. Lower
and upper time bounds for concrete recognition problems are shown, implying
that in general linear speed-up does not hold for counter machines. For bounded
languages we develop a technique for speeding up computations by any constant
factor at the expense of adding a fixed number of counters.
