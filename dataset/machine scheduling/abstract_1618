In this paper, we present a method for identifying discourse marker usage in
spontaneous speech based on machine learning. Discourse markers are denoted by
special POS tags, and thus the process of POS tagging can be used to identify
discourse markers. By incorporating POS tagging into language modeling,
discourse markers can be identified during speech recognition, in which the
timeliness of the information can be used to help predict the following words.
We contrast this approach with an alternative machine learning approach
proposed by Litman (1996). This paper also argues that discourse markers can be
used to help the hearer predict the role that the upcoming utterance plays in
the dialog. Thus discourse markers should provide valuable evidence for
automatic dialog act prediction.
