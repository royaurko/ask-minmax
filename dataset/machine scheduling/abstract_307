We describe a simple computational model of cosmic logic suitable for
analysis of, for example, discretized cosmological systems. The construction is
based on a particular model of computation, developed by Alan Turing, with
cosmic observers (CO), cosmic measures (CM) and cosmic symmetries (CS)
described by Turing machines. CO machines always start with a blank tape and CM
machines take CO's Turing number (also known as description number or G{\"
o}del number) as input and output the corresponding probability. Similarly, CS
machines take CO's Turing number as input, but output either one if the CO
machines are in the same equivalence class or zero otherwise. We argue that CS
machines are more fundamental than CM machines and, thus, should be used as
building blocks in constructing CM machines. We prove the non-computability of
a CS machine which discriminates between two classes of CO machines: mortal
that halts in finite time and immortal that runs forever. In context of eternal
inflation this result implies that it is impossible to construct CM machines to
compute probabilities using cut-off prescriptions or that all of the cut-off
measures are non-computable.
