The XCRUSH family of non-Feistel, ARX block ciphers is designed to make
efficient use of modern 64-bit general-purpose processors using a small number
of encryption rounds which are simple to implement in software. The avalanche
function, which applies one data-dependent, key-dependent rotation per 64-bit
word of plaintext per round, allows XCRUSH to achieve a fully diffuse 256-bit
ciphertext block after only two rounds. Designed for speed in software, 3-round
XCRUSH is measured at ~7.3 cycles/byte single-threaded on an Intel Haswell
processor. A pseudorandom number generator, constructed using the avalanche
function, serves as a key scheduling algorithm. No security claims are made in
this paper.
