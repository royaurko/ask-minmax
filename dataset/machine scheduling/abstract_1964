The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) and XENON experiments aim to directly
detect dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs)
via their elastic scattering on the target nuclei. The experiments use
different techniques to suppress background event rates to the minimum, and at
the same time, to achieve a high WIMP detection rate. The operation of
cryogenic Ge and Si crystals of the CDMS-II experiment in the Soudan mine
yielded the most stringent spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross-section
(~10^{-43} cm^2) at a WIMP mass of 60 GeV/c^2. The two-phase xenon detector of
the XENON10 experiment is currently taking data in the Gran Sasso underground
lab and promising preliminary results were recently reported. Both experiments
are expected to increase their WIMP sensitivity by a one order of magnitude in
the scheduled science runs for 2007.
