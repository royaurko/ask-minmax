Cloud Computing is emerging as a new computational paradigm shift.
Hadoop-MapReduce has become a powerful Computation Model for processing large
data on distributed commodity hardware clusters such as Clouds. In all Hadoop
implementations, the default FIFO scheduler is available where jobs are
scheduled in FIFO order with support for other priority based schedulers also.
In this paper we study various scheduler improvements possible with Hadoop and
also provided some guidelines on how to improve the scheduling in Hadoop in
Cloud Environments.
