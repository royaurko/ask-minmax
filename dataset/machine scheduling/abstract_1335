The purpose of this paper is to present a method for automatic classification
of dialogue utterances and the results of applying that method to a corpus.
Superficial features of a set of training utterances (which we will call cues)
are taken as the basis for finding relevant utterance classes and for
extracting rules for assigning these classes to new utterances. Each cue is
assumed to partially contribute to the communicative function of an utterance.
Instead of relying on subjective judgments for the tasks of finding classes and
rules, we opt for using machine learning techniques to guarantee objectivity.
