Nowadays, we are to find out solutions to huge computing problems very
rapidly. It brings the idea of parallel computing in which several machines or
processors work cooperatively for computational tasks. In the past decades,
there are a lot of variations in perceiving the importance of parallelism in
computing machines. And it is observed that the parallel computing is a
superior solution to many of the computing limitations like speed and density;
non-recurring and high cost; and power consumption and heat dissipation etc.
The commercial multiprocessors have emerged with lower prices than the
mainframe machines and supercomputers machines. In this article the high
performance computing (HPC) through parallel programming paradigms (PPPs) are
discussed with their constructs and design approaches.
