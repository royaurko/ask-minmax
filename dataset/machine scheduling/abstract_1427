Studying materials informatics from a data mining perspective can be
beneficial for manufacturing and other industrial engineering applications.
Predictive data mining technique and machine learning algorithm are combined to
design a knowledge discovery system for the selection of engineering materials
that meet the design specifications. Predictive method-Naive Bayesian
classifier and Machine learning Algorithm - Pearson correlation coefficient
method were implemented respectively for materials classification and
selection. The knowledge extracted from the engineering materials data sets is
proposed for effective decision making in advanced engineering materials design
applications.
