MLI is an Application Programming Interface designed to address the
challenges of building Machine Learn- ing algorithms in a distributed setting
based on data-centric computing. Its primary goal is to simplify the
development of high-performance, scalable, distributed algorithms. Our initial
results show that, relative to existing systems, this interface can be used to
build distributed implementations of a wide variety of common Machine Learning
algorithms with minimal complexity and highly competitive performance and
scalability.
