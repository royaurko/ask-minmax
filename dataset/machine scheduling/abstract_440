The Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) is
unique among the existing or planned major ground-based optical survey systems
as the only "distributed aperture" system. The concept of increasing system
\'etendue by replicating small telescopes and digital cameras presents both
management opportunities and challenges. The focus in this paper is on
management lessons learned from PS1, and how those have been used to form the
management plan for PS2. The management plan components emphasized here include
technical development, financial and schedule planning, and critical path and
risk management. Finally, the status and schedule for PS2 are presented.
