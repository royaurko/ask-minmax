We study an option pricing framework that accounts for the price impact of an
earnings announcement (EA), and analyze the behavior of the implied volatility
surface prior to the event. On the announcement date, we incorporate a random
jump to the stock price to represent the shock due to earnings. We consider
different distributions of the scheduled earnings jump as well as different
underlying stock price dynamics before and after the EA date. Our main
contributions include analytical option pricing formulas when the underlying
stock price follows the Kou model along with a double-exponential or Gaussian
EA jump on the announcement date. Furthermore, we derive analytic bounds and
asymptotics for the pre-EA implied volatility under various models. The
calibration results demonstrate adequate fit of the entire implied volatility
surface prior to an announcement. We also compare the risk-neutral distribution
of the EA jump to its historical distribution. Finally, we discuss the
valuation and exercise strategy of pre-EA American options, and illustrate an
analytical approximation and numerical results.
