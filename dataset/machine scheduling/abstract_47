With the advancement of Cloud Computing over the past few years, there has
been a massive shift from traditional data centers to cloud enabled data
centers. The enterprises with cloud data centers are focusing their attention
on energy savings through effective utilization of resources. In this work, we
propose algorithms which try to minimize the energy consumption in the data
center duly maintaining the SLA guarantees. The algorithms try to utilize least
number of physical machines in the data center by dynamically rebalancing the
physical machines based on their resource utilization. The algorithms also
perform an optimal consolidation of virtual machines on a physical machine,
minimizing SLA violations. In extensive simulation, our algorithms achieve
savings of about 21% in terms of energy consumption and in terms of maintaining
the SLAs, it performs 60% better than Single Threshold algorithm.
