An abstract machine is a theoretical model designed to perform a rigorous
study of computation. Such a model usually consists of configurations,
instructions, programs, inputs and outputs for the machine. In this paper we
formalize these notions as a very simple algebraic system, called a
configuration machine. If an abstract machine is defined as a configuration
machine consisting of primitive recursive functions then the functions computed
by the machine are always recursive. The theory of configuration machines
provides a useful tool to study universal machines.
