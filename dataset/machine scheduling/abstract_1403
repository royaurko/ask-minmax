Many casinos routinely use mechanical card shuffling machines. We were asked
to evaluate a new product, a shelf shuffler. This leads to new probability, new
combinatorics and to some practical advice which was adopted by the
manufacturer. The interplay between theory, computing, and real-world
application is developed.
