We define a notion of social machine and envisage an algebra that can
describe networks of such. To start with, social machines are defined as tuples
of input, output, processes, constraints, state, requests and responses; apart
from defining the machines themselves, the algebra defines a set of connectors
and conditionals that can be used to describe the interactions between any
number of machines in a multitude of ways, as a means to represent real
machines interacting in the real web, such as Twitter, Twitter running on top
of Amazon AWS, mashups built using Twitter and, obviously, other social
machines. This work is not a theoretical paper as yet; but, in more than one
sense, we think we have found a way to describe web based information systems
and are starting to work on what could be a practical way of dealing with the
complexity of this emerging web of social machines that is all around us. This
version should be read as work in progress and comments, observations, bugs...
are most welcome and should be sent to the email of the first, corresponding
contributor.
