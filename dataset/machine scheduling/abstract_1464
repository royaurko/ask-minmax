This is a preliminary version of visual interpretation integrating multiple
sensors in SUCCESSOR, an intelligent, model-based vision system. We pursue a
thorough integration of hierarchical Bayesian inference with comprehensive
physical representation of objects and their relations in a system for
reasoning with geometry, surface materials and sensor models in machine vision.
Bayesian inference provides a framework for accruing_ probabilities to rank
order hypotheses.
