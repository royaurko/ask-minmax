This is the first of two papers devoted to connections between asymptotic
functions of groups and computational complexity. One of the main results of
this paper states that if for every $m$ the first $m$ digits of a real number
$\alpha\ge 4$ are computable in time $\le C2^{2^{Cm}}$ for some constant $C>0$
then $n^\alpha$ is equivalent (``big O'') to the Dehn function of a finitely
presented group. The smallest isodiametric function of this group is
$n^{3/4\alpha}$. On the other hand if $n^\alpha$ is equivalent to the Dehn
function of a finitely presented group then the first $m$ digits of $\alpha$
are computable in time $\le C2^{2^{2^{Cm}}}$ for some constant $C$. This
implies that, say, functions $n^{\pi+1}$, $n^{e^2}$ and $n^\alpha$ for all
rational numbers $\alpha\ge 4$ are equivalent to the Dehn functions of some
finitely presented group and that $n^\pi$ and $n^\alpha$ for all rational
numbers $\alpha\ge 3$ are equivalent to the smallest isodiametric functions of
finitely presented groups.
  Moreover we describe all Dehn functions of finitely presented groups $\succ
n^4$ as time functions of Turing machines modulo two conjectures:
\begin{enumerate} \item Every Dehn function is equivalent to a superadditive
function. \item The square root of the time function of a Turing machine is
equivalent to the time function of a Turing machine. \end{enumerate}
