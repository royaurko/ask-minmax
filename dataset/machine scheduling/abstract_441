CSMA/ECA is a contention protocol that makes it possible to construct a
collision-free schedule by using a deterministic backoff after successful
transmissions. In this paper, we further enhance the CSMA/ECA protocol with two
properties that allows to fairly accommodate a large number of contenders in a
collision-free schedule. The first property, called hysteresis, instructs the
contenders not to reset their contention window after successful transmissions.
Thanks to hysteresis, the protocol sustains a high throughput regardless of the
number of contenders. The second property, called fair-share, preserves
fairness when different nodes use different contention windows. We present
simulations results that evidence how these properties account for performance
gains that go even further beyond CSMA/CA.
