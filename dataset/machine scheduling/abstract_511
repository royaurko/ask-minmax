We consider the jointly optimal design of a transmission scheduling and
admission control policy for adaptive video streaming over small cell networks.
We formulate the problem as a dynamic network utility maximization and observe
that it naturally decomposes into two subproblems: admission control and
transmission scheduling. The resulting algorithms are simple and suitable for
distributed implementation. The admission control decisions involve each user
choosing the quality of the video chunk asked for download, based on the
network congestion in its neighborhood. This form of admission control is
compatible with the current video streaming technology based on the DASH
protocol over TCP connections. Through simulations, we evaluate the performance
of the proposed algorithm under realistic assumptions for a small-cell network.
