We present the results of deep I and V-band photometry of the halo stars near
the southeast minor axis of the Local Group spiral galaxy M33. An (I,V-I)
color-magnitude diagram distinctly reveals the red giant branch stars at the
bright end of the color-magnitude diagram. A luminosity function in the I-band
which utilizes a background field to remove the contaminating effects of
Galactic foreground stars and distant, unresolved galaxies reveals the presence
of the tip of the red giant branch at (m-M)_{I}=20.70. Assuming an absolute
magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch of M_{I,TRGB}=-4.1 and a
foreground reddening of E(V-I)=0.054, the distance modulus of M33 is determined
to be (m-M)=24.72 (880 kpc). The metallicity distribution function derived by
interpolating between evolutionary tracks of red giant branch models is
dominated by a relatively metal poor stellar population, with a mean
metallicity of [m/H]=-0.94 or [Fe/H]=-1.24. We fit a leaky-box chemical
enrichment model to the halo data, which shows that the halo is well
represented by a single-component model with an effective yield of
y_{eff}=0.0024.
