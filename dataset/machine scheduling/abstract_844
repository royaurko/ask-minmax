Execution-replay (ER) is well known in the literature but has been restricted
to special system architectures for many years. Improved hardware resources and
the maturity of virtual machine technology promise to make ER useful for a
broader range of development projects.
  This paper describes an approach to create a practical, generic ER
infrastructure for desktop PC systems using virtual machine technology. In the
created VM environment arbitrary application programs will run and be replayed
unmodified, neither instrumentation nor recompilation are required.
