Artificial immune system can be used to generate schedules in changing
environments and it has been proven to be more robust than schedules developed
using a genetic algorithm. Good schedules can be produced especially when the
number of the antigens is increased. However, an increase in the range of the
antigens had somehow affected the fitness of the immune system. In this
research, we are trying to improve the result of the system by rescheduling the
same problem using the same method while at the same time maintaining the
robustness of the schedules.
