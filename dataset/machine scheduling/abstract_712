The paper deals with associating the optimal machining strategy to a given
pocket geometry, within the context of High-Speed Machining (HSM) of
aeronautical pockets. First we define different classes of pocket features
according to geometrical criteria. Following, we propose a method allowing to
associate a set of capable tools to the features. Each capable tool defines a
machined zone with a specific geometry. The last part of the paper is thus
dedicated to associate the optimal machining strategy to a given geometry
within the context of HSM. Results highlight that analyses must be conducted in
a dynamical as well as a geometrical viewpoint. In particular, it becomes
necessary to integrate dynamical specifities associated to the behavior of the
couple machine/NC unit in the tool path calculation.
