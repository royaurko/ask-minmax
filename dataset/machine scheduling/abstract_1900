We add 20, 6 and 3.6 cm wavelength VLA observations of two WATs, 1231+674 and
1433+553, to existing VLA data at 6 and 20 cm, in order to study the variations
of spectral index as a function of position. We apply the spectral tomography
process that we introduced in our analysis of 3C67, 3C190 and 3C449. Both
spectral tomography and polarization maps indicate that there are two distinct
extended components in each source. As in the case of 3C449, we find that each
source has a flat spectrum jet surrounded by a steeper spectrum sheath. The
steep components tend to be more highly polarized than the flat components. We
discuss a number of possibilities for the dynamics of the jet/sheath systems,
and the evolution of their relativistic electron populations. While the exact
nature of these two coaxial components is still uncertain, their existence
requires new models of jets in FR I sources and may also have implications for
the dichotomy between FR Is and FR IIs.
