Here we examine 12 Galactic clusters and OB associations containing
Wolf-Rayet stars (W-Rs) and/or Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), in order to
assess the progentor masses of these evolved massive stars. We find that in the
Milky Way, early-type WN stars evolve from stars with masses as low as 20Mo.
Some early-type WN stars are found in clusters with very high turn-off masses,
supporting our earlier results that the "WNE" class of W-Rs is a common stage
in the evolution of stars with a wide range of mases. In contrast, the
late-type WNs (particularly those of WN7 class) and the LBVs are only found in
clusters with the very highest turn-off masses, suggesting that only the most
massive stars evolve to these objects. An examination of the environment of the
archetype LBV Eta Car reveals that this star is coeval with the rest of the
Tr14/16 association, suggesting that its LBV properties is a normal consequence
of evolution, and has little to do with the possibility that it is a binary.
