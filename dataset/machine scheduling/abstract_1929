The HULLAC atomic code is used to compute wavelengths and oscillator
strengths for the 1s - np inner-shell absorption lines in Li-like to F-like
ions of neon, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, sulfur, argon, calcium, and iron.
Many of these lines are expected to be observed in Chandra and XMM-Newton
high-resolution X-ray spectra of active galaxies. The new atomic data are
incorporated in the ION code for spectral modeling of photoionized plasmas. The
calculated spectra are subsequently compared with the spectrum of NGC 3783 and
show very good agreement. The usefulness of these lines as diagnostics for the
ionization state, column densities, and velocities in line-of-sight
photoionized gas is called attention to.
