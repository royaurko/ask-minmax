A digraph that represents reasonably a scheduling problem should be a
directed acyclic graph. Here down we shall deal with special kind of graded
$DAGs$ named $KoDAGs$. For their definition and first primary properties see $
[1]$, where natural join of directed biparted graphs and their corresponding
adjacency matrices is defined and then applied to investigate cobweb posets and
their $Hasse$ digraphs called $KoDAGs$. In this report we extend the notion of
cobweb poset while delivering some elementary consequences of the description
and observations established in $[1]$.
