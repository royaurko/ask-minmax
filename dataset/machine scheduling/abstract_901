We present the first self-stabilizing consensus and replicated state machine
for asynchronous message passing systems. The scheme does not require that all
participants make a certain number of steps prior to reaching a practically
infinite execution where the replicated state machine exhibits the desired
behavior. In other words, the system reaches a configuration from which it
operates according to the specified requirements of the replicated
state-machine, for a long enough execution regarding all practical
considerations.
