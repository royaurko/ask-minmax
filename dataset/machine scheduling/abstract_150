CPU scheduling has valiant effect on resource utilization as well as overall
quality of the system. Round Robin algorithm performs optimally in time shared
systems, but it performs more number of context switches, larger waiting time
and larger response time. In order to simulate the behavior of various CPU
scheduling algorithms and to improve Round Robin scheduling algorithm using
dynamic time slice concept, in this paper we produce the implementation of new
CPU scheduling algorithm called An Optimum Multilevel Dynamic Round Robin
Scheduling (OMDRRS), which calculates intelligent time slice and warps after
every round of execution. The results display the robustness of this software,
especially for academic, research and experimental use, as well as proving the
desirability and efficiency of the probabilistic algorithm over the other
existing techniques and it is observed that this OMDRRS projects good
performance as compared to the other existing CPU scheduling algorithms.
