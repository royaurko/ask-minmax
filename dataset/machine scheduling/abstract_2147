We study the effects of randomness on competitions based on an elementary
random process in which there is a finite probability that a weaker team upsets
a stronger team. We apply this model to sports leagues and sports tournaments,
and compare the theoretical results with empirical data. Our model shows that
single-elimination tournaments are efficient but unfair: the number of games is
proportional to the number of teams N, but the probability that the weakest
team wins decays only algebraically with N. In contrast, leagues, where every
team plays every other team, are fair but inefficient: the top $\sqrt{N}$ of
teams remain in contention for the championship, while the probability that the
weakest team becomes champion is exponentially small. We also propose a gradual
elimination schedule that consists of a preliminary round and a championship
round. Initially, teams play a small number of preliminary games, and
subsequently, a few teams qualify for the championship round. This algorithm is
fair and efficient: the best team wins with a high probability and the number
of games scales as $N^{9/5}$, whereas traditional leagues require N^3 games to
fairly determine a champion.
