In the framework of on-line learning, a learning machine might move around a
teacher due to the differences in structures or output functions between the
teacher and the learning machine or due to noises. The generalization
performance of a new student supervised by a moving machine has been analyzed.
A model composed of a true teacher, a moving teacher and a student that are all
linear perceptrons with noises has been treated analytically using statistical
mechanics. It has been proven that the generalization errors of a student can
be smaller than that of a moving teacher, even if the student only uses
examples from the moving teacher.
