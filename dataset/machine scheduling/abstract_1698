We present ML4PG - a machine learning extension for Proof General. It allows
users to gather proof statistics related to shapes of goals, sequences of
applied tactics, and proof tree structures from the libraries of interactive
higher-order proofs written in Coq and SSReflect. The gathered data is
clustered using the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms available in
MATLAB and Weka. ML4PG provides automated interfacing between Proof General and
MATLAB/Weka. The results of clustering are used by ML4PG to provide proof hints
in the process of interactive proof development.
