A new strategy with bone tissue engineering by mesenchymal stem cell
transplantation on titanium implant has been dawn attention. The surface
scaffold properties of titanium surface play an important role in bone
regenerative potential of cells. The surface topography and chemistry are
postulated to be two major factors increasing the scaffold properties of
titanium implants. This study aimed to evaluate the osteogenic gene expression
of mesenchymal stem cells on titanium processed by wire-type electric discharge
machining. Some amount of roughness and distinctive irregular features were
observed on titanium processed by wire-type electric discharge machining. The
thickness of suboxide layer was concomitantly grown during the processing.
Since the thickness of oxide film and micro-topography allowed an improvement
of mRNA expression of cells, titanium processed by wire-type electric discharge
machining is a promising candidate for mesenchymal stem cell based functional
restoration of implants.
