Many programmers belive that Turing-based machines cannot think. We also
believe in this, however it is interesting to note that the most sophisticated
machines are not programmed by human beings. We have only discovered them. In
this paper, using well-known Busy Beaver and Placid Platypus machines, we
generate further very similar, but not exactly the same machines. We have found
a recombinated BB_5 machine which can make 70.740.809 steps before halting.
