The COSMO K-Coronagraph is scheduled to replace the aging Mk4 K-Coronameter
at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory of the National Center for Atmospheric
Research in 2013. We present briefly the science objectives and derived
requirements, and the optical design. We single out two topics for more
in-depth discussion: stray light, and performance of the camera and
polarimeter.
