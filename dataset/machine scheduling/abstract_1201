This paper focuses on the application of soft computing in remanufacturing
system, in which end-of-life products are disassembled into basic components
and then remanufactured for both economic and environmental reasons. The
disassembly activities include disassembly sequencing and planning, while the
remanufacturing process is composed of product design, production planning &
scheduling, and inventory management. This paper presents a review of the
related articles and suggests the corresponding further research directions.
