Synthetic waxes produced by standard and registered processes may be used to
manufacture Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA), which is a modified asphalt concrete
produced, applied and compacted at temperatures below those typically required.
This feature leads to environmental benefits, such as reduced energy
consumption, gas and fume emissions, as well as to economic/operational
advantages, such as lower production costs and greater hauling distances for
extended construction seasons with tighter schedules. The present article
serves to compare the mechanical performance of a WMA produced by adding
synthetic wax with a traditional Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) specimen, in terms of
shear fatigue response and both complex and stiffness moduli. The experimental
results and related modeling work demonstrate that adding synthetic wax into
the WMA composition does not hinder either the destructive or non-destructive
performance of an HMA, and this finding is corroborated by respectively
measuring fatigue life and stiffness.
