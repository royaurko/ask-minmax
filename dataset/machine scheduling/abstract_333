This paper describes a new scheduling algorithm to distribute jobs in server
farm systems. The proposed algorithm overcomes the starvation caused by SRPT
(Shortest Remaining Processing Time). This algorithm is used in process
scheduling in operating system approach. The algorithm was developed to be used
in dispatcher scheduling. This algorithm is non-preemptive discipline, similar
to SRPT, in which the priority of each job depends on its estimated run time,
and also the amount of time it has spent on waiting. Tasks in the servers are
served in order of priority to optimize the system response time. The
experiments show that the mean round around time is reduced in the server farm
system.
