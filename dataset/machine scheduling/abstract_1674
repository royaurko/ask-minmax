This paper describes two applications of conditional restricted Boltzmann
machines (CRBMs) to the task of autotagging music. The first consists of
training a CRBM to predict tags that a user would apply to a clip of a song
based on tags already applied by other users. By learning the relationships
between tags, this model is able to pre-process training data to significantly
improve the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) autotagging. The
second is the use of a discriminative RBM, a type of CRBM, to autotag music. By
simultaneously exploiting the relationships among tags and between tags and
audio-based features, this model is able to significantly outperform SVMs,
logistic regression, and multi-layer perceptrons. In order to be applied to
this problem, the discriminative RBM was generalized to the multi-label setting
and four different learning algorithms for it were evaluated, the first such
in-depth analysis of which we are aware.
