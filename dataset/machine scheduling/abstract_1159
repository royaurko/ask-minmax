We perform an expansion of the virtual Compton scattering amplitude for low
energies and low momenta and show that this expansion covers the transition
from the regime to be investigated in the scheduled photon electroproduction
experiments to the real Compton scattering regime.
  We discuss the relation of the generalized polarizabilities of virtual
Compton scattering to the polarizabilities of real Compton scattering.
