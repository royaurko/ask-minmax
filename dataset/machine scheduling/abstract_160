We consider the problem of scheduling a set of $n$ tasks on $m$ processors
under precedence, communication, and global system energy constraints to
minimize makespan. We extend existing scheduling models to account for energy
usage and give convex programming algorithms that yield essentially the same
results as existing algorithms that do not consider energy, while adhering to a
strict energy bound.
