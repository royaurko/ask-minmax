In a recent paper, S. Singh and K. Tankeshwar (ST), [Phys. Rev. E
\textbf{67}, 012201 (2003)], proposed a new interpretation of the collective
dynamics in liquid metals, and, in particular, of the relaxation mechanisms
ruling the density fluctuations propagation. At variance with both the
predictions of the current literature and the results of recent Inelastic X-ray
Scattering (IXS) experiments, ST associate the quasielastic component of the
$S(Q,\omega)$ to the thermal relaxation, as it holds in an ordinary adiabatic
hydrodynamics valid for non-conductive liquids and in the $Q \to 0$ limit. We
show here that this interpretation leads to a non-physical behaviour of
different thermodynamic and transport parameters.
