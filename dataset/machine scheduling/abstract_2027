A self-consistent particle-phonon coupling model is used to investigate the
properties of the isobaric analog resonance in $^{208}$Bi. It is shown that
quantitative agreement with experimental data for the energy and the width can
be obtained if the effects of isospin-breaking nuclear forces are included, in
addition to the Coulomb force effects. A connection between microscopic model
predictions and doorway state approaches which make use of the isovector
monopole resonance, is established via a phenomenological ansatz for the
optical potential.
