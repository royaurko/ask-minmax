We measure the angular correlation function of stars in a region of the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that spans 2 degrees by 1.5 degrees. We find that the
correlation functions of stellar populations are represented well by
exponential functions of the angular separation for separations between 2 and
40 arcmin (corresponding to ~ 30 pc and 550 pc for an LMC distance of 50 kpc).
The inner boundary is set by the presence of distinct, highly correlated
structures, which are the more familiar stellar clusters, and the outer
boundary is set by the observed region's size and the presence of two principal
centers of star formation within the region. We also find that the
normalization and scale length of the correlation function changes
systematically with the mean age of the stellar population. The existence of
positive correlation at large separations (~300 pc), even in the youngest
population, argues for large-scale hierarchical structure in current star
formation. The evolution of the angular correlation toward lower normalizations
and longer scale lengths with stellar age argues for the dispersion of stars
with time. We show that a simple, stochastic, self-propagating star formation
model is qualitatively consistent with this behavior of the correlation
function.
