This paper describes the X-ray emission from supernova remnants evolving in
warm, low density, nonthermal pressure dominated regions. Non-equilibrium
ionization hydrocode simulations are used to predict the high resolution
spectra, ROSAT PSPC countrates, spatial appearance, color temperatures, and the
O VII and O VIII emission line fluxes as a function of time.
  For comparisons with observations, this paper also applies the standard
observational analyses for determining the color temperature, electron density,
and thermal pressure to ROSAT ``observations'' of one of the simulated
remnants, thus providing a map between observational results and physical
conditions. The simulated remnants' C IV, N V, and O VI column densities are
also reported.
  The simulations are applied to studies of the Galactic halo and Local Bubble
and additionally may be of interest to studies of external galaxies and
Galactic interarm regions.
