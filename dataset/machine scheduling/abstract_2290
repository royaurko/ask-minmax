The Euclid space mission proposes to survey 15000 square degrees of the
extragalactic sky during 6 years, with a step-and-stare technique. The
scheduling of observation sequences is driven by the primary scientific
objectives, spacecraft constraints, calibration requirements and physical
properties of the sky. We present the current reference implementation of the
Euclid survey and on-going work on survey optimization.
