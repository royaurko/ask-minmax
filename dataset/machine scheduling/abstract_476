We study here schedulers for a class of rules that naturally arise in the
context of rule-based constraint programming. We systematically derive a
scheduler for them from a generic iteration algorithm of [Apt 2000]. We apply
this study to so-called membership rules of [Apt and Monfroy 2001]. This leads
to an implementation that yields a considerably better performance for these
rules than their execution as standard CHR rules. Finally, we show how
redundant rules can be identified and how appropriately reduced sets of rules
can be computed.
