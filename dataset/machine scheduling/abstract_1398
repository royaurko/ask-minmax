We define a new transfinite time model of computation, infinite time cellular
automata. The model is shown to be as powerful than infinite time Turing
machines, both on finite and infinite inputs; thus inheriting many of its
properties. We then show how to simulate the canonical real computation model,
BSS machines, with infinite time cellular automata in exactly \omega steps.
