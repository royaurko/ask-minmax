We propose a variant of the Simulated Annealing method for optimization in
the multivariate analysis of differentiable functions. The method uses global
actualizations via the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm in their generalized
version for the proposal of new configurations. We show how this choice can
improve upon the performance of simulated annealing methods (mainly when the
number of variables is large) by allowing a more effective searching scheme and
a faster annealing schedule.
