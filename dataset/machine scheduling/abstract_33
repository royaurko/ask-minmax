We investigate dynamic algorithms for the interval scheduling problem. Our
algorithm runs in amortised time $O(\log n)$ for query operation and $O(d\log^2
n)$ for insertion and removal operations, where $n$ and $d$ are the maximal
numbers of intervals and pairwise overlapping intervals respectively. We also
show that for a monotonic set, that is when no interval properly contains
another interval, the amortised complexity is $O(\log n)$ for both query and
update operations. We compare the two algorithms for the monotonic interval
sets using experiments.
