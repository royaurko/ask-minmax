The state of a particle in space and time is characterized by its mass and
spin, which therefore determine the inertial properties of the particle. The
coupling of intrinsic spin with rotation is examined and the corresponding
inertial effects of intrinsic spin are studied. An experiment to measure
directly the spin-rotation coupling via neutron interferometry is analyzed in
detail.
