A simple model for the reaction-driven propulsion of a small device is
proposed as a model for (part of) a molecular machine in aqueous media. Motion
of the device is driven by an asymmetric distribution of reaction products. The
propulsive velocity of the device is calculated as well as the scale of the
velocity fluctuations. The effects of hydrodynamic flow as well as a number of
different scenarios for the kinetics of the reaction are addressed.
