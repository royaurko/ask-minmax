We consider a wireless device-to-device (D2D) network where the nodes have
cached information from a library of possible files. Inspired by the current
trend in the standardization of the D2D mode for 4th generation wireless
networks, we restrict to one-hop communication: each node place a request to a
file in the library, and downloads from some other node which has the requested
file in its cache through a direct communication link, without going through a
base station. We describe the physical layer communication through a simple
"protocol-model", based on interference avoidance (independent set scheduling).
For this network we define the outage-throughput tradeoff problem and
characterize the optimal scaling laws for various regimes where both the number
of nodes and the files in the library grow to infinity.
