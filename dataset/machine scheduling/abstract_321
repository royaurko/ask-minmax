The downlink transmission in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems has been extensively studied from both communication-theoretic and
information-theoretic perspectives. Most of these papers assume
perfect/imperfect channel knowledge. In general, the problem of channel
training and estimation is studied separately. However, in interference-limited
communication systems with high mobility, this problem is tightly coupled with
the problem of maximizing throughput of the system. In this paper, scheduling
and pre-conditioning based schemes in the presence of reciprocal channel are
considered to address this. In the case of homogeneous users, a scheduling
scheme is proposed and an improved lower bound on the sum capacity is derived.
The problem of choosing training sequence length to maximize net throughput of
the system is studied. In the case of heterogeneous users, a modified
pre-conditioning method is proposed and an optimized pre-conditioning matrix is
derived. This method is combined with a scheduling scheme to further improve
net achievable weighted-sum rate.
