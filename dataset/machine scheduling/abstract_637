This paper addresses the impact of Virtual Memory Streaming (VMS) technique
in provisioning virtual machines (VMs) in cloud environment. VMS is a scaling
virtualization technology that allows different virtual machines rapid scale,
high performance, and increase hardware utilization. Traditional hypervisors do
not support true no-downtime live migration, and its lack of memory
oversubscription can hurt the economics of a private cloud deployment by
limiting the number of VMs on each host. VMS brings together several advanced
hypervisor memory management techniques including granular page sharing,
dynamic memory footprint management, live migration, read caching, and a unique
virtual machine cloning capability. An architecture model is described,
together with a proof-of-concept implementation, that VMS dynamically scaling
of virtualized infrastructure with true live migration and cloning of VMs. This
paper argues that VMS for Cloud allows requiring significantly reduced server
memory and reducing the time for virtualized resource scaling by instantly
adding more virtual machines.
