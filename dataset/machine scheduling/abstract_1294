Simultaneous multiuser beamforming in multiantenna downlink channels can
entail dirty paper (DP) precoding (optimal and high complexity) or linear
precoding (suboptimal and low complexity) approaches. The system performance is
typically characterized by the sum capacity with homogenous users with perfect
channel state information at the transmitter. The sum capacity performance
analysis requires the exact probability distributions of the user
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) or signal-to-interference plus noise ratios
(SINRs). The standard techniques from order statistics can be sufficient to
obtain the probability distributions of SNRs for DP precoding due to the
removal of known interference at the transmitter. Derivation of such
probability distributions for linear precoding techniques on the other hand is
much more challenging. For example, orthogonal beamforming techniques do not
completely cancel the interference at the user locations, thereby requiring the
analysis with SINRs. In this paper, we derive the joint probability
distributions of the user SINRs for two orthogonal beamforming methods combined
with user scheduling: adaptive orthogonal beamforming and orthogonal linear
beamforming. We obtain compact and unified solutions for the joint probability
distributions of the scheduled users' SINRs. Our analytical results can be
applied for similar algorithms and are verified by computer simulations.
