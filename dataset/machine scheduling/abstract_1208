We introduce an iterative solution to the problem of interference alignment
(IA) over MIMO channels based on a message-passing formulation. We propose a
parameterization of the messages that enables the computation of IA precoders
by a min-sum algorithm over continuous variable spaces -- under this
parameterization, suitable approximations of the messages can be computed in
closed-form. We show that the iterative leakage minimization algorithm of
Cadambe et al. is a special case of our message-passing algorithm, obtained for
a particular schedule. Finally, we show that the proposed algorithm compares
favorably to iterative leakage minimization in terms of convergence speed, and
discuss a distributed implementation.
