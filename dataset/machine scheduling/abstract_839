We describe a machine learning method for predicting the value of a
real-valued function, given the values of multiple input variables. The method
induces solutions from samples in the form of ordered disjunctive normal form
(DNF) decision rules. A central objective of the method and representation is
the induction of compact, easily interpretable solutions. This rule-based
decision model can be extended to search efficiently for similar cases prior to
approximating function values. Experimental results on real-world data
demonstrate that the new techniques are competitive with existing machine
learning and statistical methods and can sometimes yield superior regression
performance.
