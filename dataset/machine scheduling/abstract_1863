In the era of deep learning several unsupervised models have been developed
to capture the key features in unlabeled handwritten data. Popular among them
is the Restricted Boltzmann Machines RBM. However, due to the novelty in
handwritten multidialect data, the RBM may fail to generate an efficient
representation. In this paper we propose a generative model, the Mode
Synthesizing Machine MSM for on-line representation of real life handwritten
multidialect language data. The MSM takes advantage of the hierarchical
representation of the modes of a data distribution using a two-point error
update to learn a sequence of representative multidialects in a generative way.
Experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the MSM over the RBM
with the former attaining much lower error values than the latter on both
independent and mixed data set.
