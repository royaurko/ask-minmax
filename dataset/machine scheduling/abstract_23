Energy efficiency has become an important measurement of scheduling
algorithms in virtualized data centers. One of the challenges of
energy-efficient scheduling algorithms, however, is the trade-off between
minimizing energy consumption and satisfying quality of service (e.g.
performance, resource availability on time for reservation requests). We
consider resource needs in the context of virtualized data centers of a private
cloud system, which provides resource leases in terms of virtual machines (VMs)
for user applications. In this paper, we propose heuristics for scheduling VMs
that address the above challenge. On performance evaluation, simulated results
have shown a significant reduction on total energy consumption of our proposed
algorithms compared with an existing First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling
algorithm with the same fulfillment of performance requirements. We also
discuss the improvement of energy saving when additionally using migration
policies to the above mentioned algorithms.
