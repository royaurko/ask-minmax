We give the first algorithm for testing the feasibility of a system of
sporadic real-time tasks on a set of identical processors, solving one major
open problem in the area of multiprocessor real-time scheduling [S.K. Baruah
and K. Pruhs, Journal of Scheduling, 2009]. We also investigate the related
notion of schedulability and a notion that we call online feasibility. Finally,
we show that discrete-time schedules are as powerful as continuous-time
schedules, which answers another open question in the above mentioned survey.
