Possible surface brightness selection effects in the redshift catalogs of the
Canada-France Redshift Survey are investigated through comparisons of
subsamples of the data. Our analyses demonstrate that the securing of redshifts
is independent of possible biases arising from surface brightness effects
and/or differing galaxy morphologies and orientations. The unusual geometry of
the mask designs for our spectroscopic observations also do not produce any
significant bias. There is however a bias at the highest and lowest redshifts,
especially for absorption-line galaxies at z > 1 and z < 0.2, due to the
adopted spectral range (4250A to 8500A). Apart from the latter, we conclude
that our sample of identified galaxies is an unbiased subsample of the original
photometric catalogue and is essentially limited by I-band flux density ($17.5
\leq I_{AB} \leq 22.5$). Finally, spectroscopic data for 273 objects in the
0300+00 CFRS field are presented.
