Attack detection problems in the smart grid are posed as statistical learning
problems for different attack scenarios in which the measurements are observed
in batch or online settings. In this approach, machine learning algorithms are
used to classify measurements as being either secure or attacked. An attack
detection framework is provided to exploit any available prior knowledge about
the system and surmount constraints arising from the sparse structure of the
problem in the proposed approach. Well-known batch and online learning
algorithms (supervised and semi-supervised) are employed with decision and
feature level fusion to model the attack detection problem. The relationships
between statistical and geometric properties of attack vectors employed in the
attack scenarios and learning algorithms are analyzed to detect unobservable
attacks using statistical learning methods. The proposed algorithms are
examined on various IEEE test systems. Experimental analyses show that machine
learning algorithms can detect attacks with performances higher than the attack
detection algorithms which employ state vector estimation methods in the
proposed attack detection framework.
