Mass loss is a fundamental, observationally well-established feature of AGB
stars but many aspects of this process still remain to be understood. To date,
self-consistent dynamical models of dust-driven winds reproducing the observed
mass-loss rates seem only possible for M-type stars if the grains in the close
circumstellar environment grow to larger sizes than previously assumed. In
order to study the grain-size distribution where the mass loss is initiated,
high-spatial-resolution interferometry observations are necessary. We have
observed two M-type stars using the VLTI/MIDI instrument to constrain the
dust-grain sizes through modeling the 10-micron silicate feature. Complementary
observations are scheduled and we will present preliminary results.
