An absolute lower bound on the number of templates needed to keep the fitting
factor above a prescribed minimal value $\Gamma$ in correlator bank detection
of (newtonian) gravitational wave chirps from unknown inspiraling compact
binary sources is derived, resorting to the theory of quasi-bandlimited
functions in the $L^\infty$ norm. An explicit nearly-minimum redundant
cardinal-interpolation formula for the (reduced, noncoherent) correlator is
introduced. Its computational burden and statistical properties are compared to
those of the plain lattice of (reduced, noncoherent) correlators, for the same
$\Gamma$. Extension to post-newtonian models is outlined.
