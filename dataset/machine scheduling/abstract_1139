We report on the results of optical studies of the newly discovered
superconductor Cd$_2$Re$_2$O$_7$ in the normal state. We show that the compound
has an exotic metallic state at low temperature. The optical conductivity
spectrum exhibits two distinct features: a sharp renormalized resonance mode at
zero frequency and a broad mid-infrared excitation band. Detailed analysis
reveals a moderate enhancement of the effective mass at low temperature and low
frequency.
