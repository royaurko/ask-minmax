This paper focuses on services and applications provided to mobile users
using airborne computing infrastructure. We present concepts such as
drones-as-a-service and fly-in,fly-out infrastructure, and note data management
and system design issues that arise in these scenarios. Issues of Big Data
arising from such applications, optimising the configuration of airborne and
ground infrastructure to provide the best QoS and QoE, situation-awareness,
scalability, reliability, scheduling for efficiency, interaction with users and
drones using physical annotations are outlined.
