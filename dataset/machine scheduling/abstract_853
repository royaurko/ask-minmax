We consider a scenario that involves a machine gun, the bullets it fires and
a moving target, considered from the rest frame of the machine gun and from the
rest frame of the target respectively. Involving the special relativity via its
two postulates and the time dilation formula we derive the relativistic
velocity addition law showing that it leads to the Lorentz transformations for
the space-time coordinates of the same event.
