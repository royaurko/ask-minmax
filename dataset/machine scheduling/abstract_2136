The NA61/SHINE at the CERN SPS is a new experiment to study hadron production
in p+p p+A, h+A and A+A interactions. The main goal of the NA61 ion program is
to explore the phase diagram (T - mu_B) of strongly interacting matter. In
particular, we plan to study the properties of the onset of deconfinement and
to search for the signatures of the critical point. A two-dimensional scan of
the phase diagram will be performed by varying the energy (13A-158A GeV) and
system size (p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Ca, Xe+La) of collisions. This paper summarizes the
status and plans of the NA61/SHINE ion program. In particular the detector
upgrades, data taking schedule and the first results on spectra and
correlations are discussed.
