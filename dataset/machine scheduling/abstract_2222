MicroBooNE is a neutrino experiment located on axis in the Booster Neutrino
Beamline, at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, scheduled to begin data
collection in 2014. The MicroBooNE detector consists of two main components: a
large liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC), and a light collection
system. Thirty two 8-inch diameter cryogenic photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) will
detect the scintillation light generated in the liquid argon. In this article,
we describe the basic features of the system and current status of MicroBooNE
light collection system.
