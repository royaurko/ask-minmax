For wireless systems in which randomly arriving devices attempt to transmit a
fixed payload to a central receiver, we develop a framework to characterize the
system throughput as a function of arrival rate and per-user data rate. The
framework considers both coordinated transmission (where devices are scheduled)
and uncoordinated transmission (where devices communicate on a random access
channel and a provision is made for retransmissions). Our main contribution is
a novel characterization of the optimal throughput for the case of
uncoordinated transmission and a strategy for achieving this throughput that
relies on overlapping transmissions and joint decoding. Simulations for a
noise-limited cellular network show that the optimal strategy provides a factor
of four improvement in throughput compared to slotted aloha. We apply our
framework to evaluate more general system-level designs that account for
overhead signaling. We demonstrate that, for small payload sizes relevant for
machine-to-machine (M2M) communications (200 bits or less), a one-stage
strategy, where identity and data are transmitted optimally over the random
access channel, can support at least twice the number of devices compared to a
conventional strategy, where identity is established over an initial
random-access stage and data transmission is scheduled.
