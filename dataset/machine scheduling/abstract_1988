This article reviews the progress of atomic force microscopy (AFM) in
ultra-high vacuum, starting with its invention and covering most of the recent
developments. Today, dynamic force microscopy allows to image surfaces of
conductors \emph{and} insulators in vacuum with atomic resolution. The mostly
used technique for atomic resolution AFM in vacuum is frequency modulation AFM
(FM-AFM). This technique, as well as other dynamic AFM methods, are explained
in detail in this article. In the last few years many groups have expanded the
empirical knowledge and deepened the theoretical understanding of FM-AFM.
Consequently, the spatial resolution and ease of use have been increased
dramatically. Vacuum AFM opens up new classes of experiments, ranging from
imaging of insulators with true atomic resolution to the measurement of forces
between individual atoms.
