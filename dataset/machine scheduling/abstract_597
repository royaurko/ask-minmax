Although modern supercomputers are composed of multicore machines, one can
find scientists that still execute their legacy applications which were
developed to monocore cluster where memory hierarchy is dedicated to a sole
core. The main objective of this paper is to propose and evaluate an algorithm
that identify an efficient blocksize to be applied on MPI stencil computations
on multicore machines. Under the light of an extensive experimental analysis,
this work shows the benefits of identifying blocksizes that will dividing data
on the various cores and suggest a methodology that explore the memory
hierarchy available in modern machines.
