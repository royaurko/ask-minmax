In cellular systems, virtual multiple-input multiple-output (V-MIMO)
technology promises to achieve performance gains comparable to conventional
MIMO. In this paper, we propose cooperative relay selection algorithm based on
machine learning techniques. Willingness of user to cooperate in V-MIMO depends
on his current battery power, time and day along with incentives offered by
service provider. Every user has different criterion to participate in V-MIMO,
but allows a specific behavior pattern. Therefore, it is required to predict
willing users in the neighborhood of source user (SU), before selecting users
as cooperative nodes. Only inactive users belonging to Virtual Antenna Array
(VAA) cell of SU are assumed to cooperate. This reduces control overheads in
cooperative node discovery. In this paper, we employ prediction algorithm using
two machine learning techniques i.e. ANN and SVM to find out inactive willing
users within VAA cell. The parameters such as MSE, accuracy, precision and
recall are calculated to evaluate performance of ANN and SVM model. Prediction
using ANN has MSE of 3% with average accuracy of 97% (variance 0.37), whereas
SVM has MSE of 2.58% with average accuracy of 97.56% (variance 0.17). We also
observe that proposed prediction method reduces the node discovery time by
approximately 29%.
