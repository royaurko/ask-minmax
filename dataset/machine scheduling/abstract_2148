Sequential and Quantum Monte Carlo methods, as well as genetic type search
algorithms can be interpreted as a mean field and interacting particle
approximations of Feynman-Kac models in distribution spaces. The performance of
these population Monte Carlo algorithms is strongly related to the stability
properties of nonlinear Feynman-Kac semigroups. In this paper, we analyze these
models in terms of Dobrushin ergodic coefficients of the reference Markov
transitions and the oscillations of the potential functions. Sufficient
conditions for uniform concentration inequalities w.r.t. time are expressed
explicitly in terms of these two quantities. We provide an original
perturbation analysis that applies to annealed and adaptive FK models, yielding
what seems to be the first results of this kind for these type of models.
Special attention is devoted to the particular case of Boltzmann-Gibbs
measures' sampling. In this context, we design an explicit way of tuning the
number of Markov Chain Monte Carlo iterations with temperature schedule. We
also propose and analyze an alternative interacting particle method based on an
adaptive strategy to define the temperature increments.
