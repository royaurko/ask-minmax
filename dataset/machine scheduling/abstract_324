We analyze scheduling algorithms for multiuser communication systems with
users having multiple antennas and linear receivers. When there is no feedback
of channel information, we consider a common round robin scheduling algorithm,
and derive new exact and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximum sum-rate
results for the maximum ratio combining (MRC) and minimum mean squared error
(MMSE) receivers. We also present new analysis of MRC, zero forcing (ZF) and
MMSE receivers in the low SNR regime. When there are limited feedback
capabilities in the system, we consider a common practical scheduling scheme
based on signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) feedback at the
transmitter. We derive new accurate approximations for the maximum sum-rate,
for the cases of MRC, ZF and MMSE receivers. We also derive maximum sum-rate
scaling laws, which reveal that the maximum sum-rate of all three linear
receivers converge to the same value for a large number of users, but at
different rates.
