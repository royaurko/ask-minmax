We discuss a general technique that can be used to form a differentiable
bound on the optima of non-differentiable or discrete objective functions. We
form a unified description of these methods and consider under which
circumstances the bound is concave. In particular we consider two concrete
applications of the method, namely sparse learning and support vector
classification.
