In this paper, we present some results regarding the size complexity of
Accepting Networks of Evolutionary Processors with Filtered Connections
(ANEPFCs). We show that there are universal ANEPFCs of size 10, by devising a
method for simulating 2-Tag Systems. This result significantly improves the
known upper bound for the size of universal ANEPFCs which is 18.
  We also propose a new, computationally and descriptionally efficient
simulation of nondeterministic Turing machines by ANEPFCs. More precisely, we
describe (informally, due to space limitations) how ANEPFCs with 16 nodes can
simulate in O(f(n)) time any nondeterministic Turing machine of time complexity
f(n). Thus the known upper bound for the number of nodes in a network
simulating an arbitrary Turing machine is decreased from 26 to 16.
