In the paper "Relating Strong Behavioral Equivalences for Processes with
Nondeterminism and Probabilities" to appear in TCS, we present a comparison of
behavioral equivalences for nondeterministic and probabilistic processes. In
particular, we consider strong trace, failure, testing, and bisimulation
equivalences. For each of these groups of equivalences, we examine the
discriminating power of three variants stemming from three approaches that
differ for the way probabilities of events are compared when nondeterministic
choices are resolved via deterministic schedulers. The established
relationships are summarized in a so-called spectrum. However, the equivalences
we consider in that paper are only a small subset of those considered in the
original spectrum of equivalences for nondeterministic systems introduced by
Rob van Glabbeek. In this companion paper we we enlarge the spectrum by
considering variants of trace equivalences (completed-trace equivalences),
additional decorated-trace equivalences (failure-trace, readiness, and
ready-trace equivalences), and variants of bisimulation equivalences (kernels
of simulation, completed-simulation, failure-simulation, and ready-simulation
preorders). Moreover, we study how the spectrum changes when randomized
schedulers are used instead of deterministic ones.
