Sorting is one of the classic problems of computer science. Whilst well
understood on sequential machines, the diversity of architectures amongst
parallel systems means that algorithms do not perform uniformly on all
platforms. This document describes the implementation of a radix based
algorithm for sorting positive integers on a Fujitsu AP1000 Supercomputer,
which was constructed as an entry in the Joint Symposium on Parallel Processing
(JSPP) 1994 Parallel Software Contest (PSC94). Brief consideration is also
given to a full radix sort conducted in parallel across the machine.
