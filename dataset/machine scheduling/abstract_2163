Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Intensive sessions are scheduled to
provide operational Universal Time (UT1) determinations with low latency. UT1
estimates obtained from these observations heavily depend on the model of the
celestial pole motion used during data processing. However, even the most
accurate precession-nutation model, IAU 2000/2006, is not accurate enough to
realize the full potential of VLBI observations. To achieve the highest
possible accuracy in UT1 estimates, a celestial pole offset (CPO), which is the
difference between the actual and modelled precession-nutation angles, should
be applied. Three CPO models are currently available for users. In this paper,
these models have been tested and the differences between UT1 estimates
obtained with those models are investigated. It has been shown that neglecting
CPO modelling during VLBI UT1 Intensive processing causes systematic errors in
UT1 series of up to 20 microarcseconds. It has been also found that using
different CPO models causes the differences in UT1 estimates reaching 10
microarcseconds. Obtained results are applicable to the satellite data
processing as well.
