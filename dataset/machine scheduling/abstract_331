Opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes are proposed for multiuser
MIMO-SDMA downlink systems with linear combining in this work. Signals received
from all antennas of each mobile terminal (MT) are linearly combined to improve
the {\em effective} signal-to-noise-interference ratios (SINRs). By exploiting
limited feedback on the effective SINRs, the base station (BS) schedules
simultaneous data transmission on multiple beams to the MTs with the largest
effective SINRs. Utilizing the extreme value theory, we derive the asymptotic
system throughputs and scaling laws for the proposed scheduling and beamforming
schemes with different linear combining techniques. Computer simulations
confirm that the proposed schemes can substantially improve the system
throughput.
