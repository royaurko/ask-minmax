This article considers application of genetic algorithms for finite machine
synthesis. The resulting genetic finite state machines synthesis algorithm
allows for creation of machines with less number of states and within shorter
time. This makes it possible to use hardware-oriented genetic finite machines
synthesis algorithm in autonomous systems on reconfigurable platforms.
