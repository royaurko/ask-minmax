Computational Grids are a new trend in distributed computing systems. They
allow the sharing of geographically distributed resources in an efficient way,
extending the boundaries of what we perceive as distributed computing. Various
sciences can benefit from the use of grids to solve CPU-intensive problems,
creating potential benefits to the entire society. Job scheduling is an
integrated part of parallel and distributed computing. It allows selecting
correct match of resource for a particular job and thus increases the job
throughput and utilization of resources. Job should be scheduled in an
automatic way to make the system more reliable, accessible and less sensitive
to subsystem failures. This paper provides a survey on various heuristic
algorithms, used for scheduling in grid.
