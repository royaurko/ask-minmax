The work presented in this paper aims at restricting the input parameter
values of the semi-analytical model used in GALICS and MOMAF, so as to derive
which parameters influence the most the results, e.g., star formation, feedback
and halo recycling efficiencies, etc. Our approach is to proceed empirically:
we run lots of simulations and derive the correct ranges of values. The
computation time needed is so large, that we need to run on a grid of
computers. Hence, we model GALICS and MOMAF execution time and output files
size, and run the simulation using a grid middleware: DIET. All the complexity
of accessing resources, scheduling simulations and managing data is harnessed
by DIET and hidden behind a web portal accessible to the users.
