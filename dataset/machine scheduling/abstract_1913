As part of a 4-year Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (CosPA) Research
Excellence Initiative in Taiwan, AMiBA $-$ a 19-element dual-channel 85-105 GHz
interferometer array is being specifically built to search for high redshift
clusters of galaxies via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect (SZE). In addition, AMiBA
will have full polarization capabilities, in order to probe the polarization
properties of the Cosmic Microwave Background. AMiBA, to be sited on Mauna Kea
in Hawaii or in Chile, will reach a sensitivity of $\sim 1$ mJy or 7$\mu$K in 1
hour. The project involves extensive international scientific and technical
collaborations. The construction of AMiBA is scheduled to starting operating in
early 2004.
