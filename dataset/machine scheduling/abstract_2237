Recently, researchers in answer set programming and constraint programming
spent significant efforts in the development of hybrid languages and solving
algorithms combining the strengths of these traditionally separate fields.
These efforts resulted in a new research area: constraint answer set
programming (CASP). CASP languages and systems proved to be largely successful
at providing efficient solutions to problems involving hybrid reasoning tasks,
such as scheduling problems with elements of planning. Yet, the development of
CASP systems is difficult, requiring non-trivial expertise in multiple areas.
This suggests a need for a study identifying general development principles of
hybrid systems. Once these principles and their implications are well
understood, the development of hybrid languages and systems may become a
well-established and well-understood routine process. As a step in this
direction, in this paper we conduct a case study aimed at evaluating various
integration schemas of CASP methods.
