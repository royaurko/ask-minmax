We propose here a method to estimate a delay from a time series taking
advantage of analysis of random walks with delay. This method is applicable to
a time series coming out of a system which is or can be approximated as a
linear feedback system with delay and noise. We successfully test the method
with a time series generated by discrete Langevin equation with delay.
