The increased affordability of whole genome sequencing has motivated its use
for phenotypic studies. We address the problem of learning interpretable models
for discrete phenotypes from whole genomes. We propose a general approach that
relies on the Set Covering Machine and a k-mer representation of the genomes.
We show results for the problem of predicting the resistance of Pseudomonas
Aeruginosa, an important human pathogen, against 4 antibiotics. Our results
demonstrate that extremely sparse models which are biologically relevant can be
learnt using this approach.
