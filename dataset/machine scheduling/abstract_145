We consider the problem of scheduling packets of different lengths via a
directed communication link prone to jamming errors. Dynamic packet arrivals
and errors are modelled by an adversary. We focus on estimating relative
throughput of online scheduling algorithms, that is, the ratio between the
throughputs achieved by the algorithm and the best scheduling for the same
arrival and error patterns. This framework allows more accurate analysis of
performance of online scheduling algorithms, even in worst-case arrival and
error scenarios. We design an online algorithm for scheduling packets of
arbitrary lengths, achieving optimal relative throughput in the range (1/3,1/2]
(the exact value depends on packet lengths). In other words, for any arrival
and jamming patterns, our solution gives throughput which is no more than c
times worse than the best possible scheduling for these patters, where c in [2;
3) is the inverse of relative throughput. Another algorithm we design makes use
of additional resources in order to achieve relative throughput 1, that is, it
achieves at least as high throughput as the best schedule without such
resources, for any arrival and jamming patterns. More precisely, we show that
if the algorithm can run with double speed, i.e., with twice higher frequency,
then its relative throughput is 1. This demonstrates that throughput of the
best online scheduling algorithms scales well with resource augmentation.
