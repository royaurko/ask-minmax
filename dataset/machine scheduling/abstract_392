One of the roots of evolutionary computation was the idea of Turing about
unorganized machines. The goal of this work is the development of foundations
for evolutionary computations, connecting Turing's ideas and the contemporary
state of art in evolutionary computations. To achieve this goal, we develop a
general approach to evolutionary processes in the computational context,
building mathematical models of computational systems, functioning of which is
based on evolutionary processes, and studying properties of such systems.
Operations with evolutionary machines are described and it is explored when
definite classes of evolutionary machines are closed with respect to basic
operations with these machines. We also study such properties as linguistic and
functional equivalence of evolutionary machines and their classes, as well as
computational power of evolutionary machines and their classes, comparing of
evolutionary machines to conventional automata, such as finite automata or
Turing machines.
