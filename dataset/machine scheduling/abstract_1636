We introduce a new approach to enable an open and public parallel machine
which is accessible for multi users with multi jobs belong to different blocks
running at the same time. The concept is required especially for parallel
machines which are dedicated for public use as implemented at the LIPI Public
Cluster. We have deployed the simplest technique by running multi daemons of
parallel processing engine with different configuration files specified for
each user assigned to access the system, and also developed an integrated
system to fully control and monitor the whole system over web. A brief
performance analysis is also given for Message Parsing Interface (MPI) engine.
It is shown that the proposed approach is quite reliable and affect the whole
performances only slightly.
