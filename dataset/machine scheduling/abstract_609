Machine Translation is one of the research fields of Computational
Linguistics. The objective of many MT Researchers is to develop an MT System
that produce good quality and high accuracy output translations and which also
covers maximum language pairs. As internet and Globalization is increasing day
by day, we need a way that improves the quality of translation. For this
reason, we have developed a Classifier based Text Simplification Model for
English-Hindi Machine Translation Systems. We have used support vector machines
and Na\"ive Bayes Classifier to develop this model. We have also evaluated the
performance of these classifiers.
