We consider the problem of joint link scheduling and power control for
wireless networks with average transmission power constraints. Due to the high
computational complexity of the optimal policies, we extend the class of greedy
link scheduling policies to handle average power constraints. We develop a
greedy link scheduling and power control scheme GECS, with provable performance
guarantees.
  We show that the performance of our greedy scheduler can be characterized
using the Local Pooling Factor (LPF) of a network graph, which has been
previously used to characterize the stability of the Greedy Maximal Scheduling
(GMS) policy for wireless networks. We also simulate the performance of GECS on
wireless network, and compare its performance to another candidate greedy link
scheduling and power control policy.
