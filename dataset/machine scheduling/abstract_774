In 2005 Li et al. gave a phi-competitive deterministic online algorithm for
scheduling of packets with agreeable deadlines with a very interesting
analysis. This is known to be optimal due to a lower bound by Hajek. We claim
that the algorithm by Li et al. can be slightly simplified, while retaining its
competitive ratio. Then we introduce randomness to the modified algorithm and
argue that the competitive ratio against oblivious adversary is at most 4/3.
Note that this still leaves a gap between the best known lower bound of 5/4 by
Chin et al. for randomised algorithms against oblivious adversary.
