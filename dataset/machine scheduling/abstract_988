A concept of randomness for infinite time register machines (ITRMs) is
defined and studied. In particular, we show that for this notion of randomness,
computability from mutually random reals implies computability and that an
analogue of van Lambalgen's theorem holds. This is then applied to obtain
results on the structure of ITRM-degrees. Finally, we consider autoreducibility
for ITRMs and show that randomness implies non-autoreducibility.
