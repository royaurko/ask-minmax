The scalar sector of the electroweak theory can be probed by a mu^+mu^-
collider S channel resonance machine. We give arguments for when such a machine
may be needed and when this information could be obtained by the LHC detector.
A very interesting case is the possibility that several scalar particles are in
the same mass range for the supersymmetric Higgs bosons h, H, and A, which
would definitely require such a machine. The Higgs factory could follow the
construction of a neutrino factory.
