The Third Infoscape refers to the information and knowledge generated through
the myriads of micro-histories, through the progressive, emergent and
polyphonic sedimentation of the expressions of the daily lives of city
dwellers. To all effects, with the development of wireless sensors, of smart
dust1, and with the possibility to engage human beings in urban sensing
processes, the dimension of virtuality collapses. Heading towards a state which
is basically comparable to the one of telepathy (among human beings, human
beings and machines, machines and machines...), reconfiguring urban ecologies
so that mapping virtuality or physicality would not be needed anymore, and
replacing this need with the possibility to create recombinant inventories of
the telepathic migration of dusts, of the myriads of pulverized sensors which
are disseminated, diffused. We can imagine information mutating into landscape,
delineating an urban space which is not determined by distance and time, but
from the transformation of densities and presences.
