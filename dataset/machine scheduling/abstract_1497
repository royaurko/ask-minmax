Energy harvesting or power harvesting or energy scavenging is a process where
energy is derived from external sources (e.g. solar power, thermal energy, wind
energy, salinity gradients, kinetic energy etc.), captured, and stored for
small, wireless autonomous devices, like those used in wearable electronics and
wireless sensor networks. This paper is focused to applications of Energy
Harvesting in Wireless Sensor Networks. This is going to help the ever growing
M2M (Machine to Machine) field where there is an exponential growth of
intelligent devices and automatic control of these is of paramount importance.
