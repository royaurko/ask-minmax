Linear dependent types allow to precisely capture both the extensional
behaviour and the time complexity of lambda terms, when the latter are
evaluated by Krivine's abstract machine. In this work, we show that the same
paradigm can be applied to call-by-value evaluation. A system of linear
dependent types for Plotkin's PCF is introduced, called dlPCFV, whose types
reflect the complexity of evaluating terms in the so-called CEK machine. dlPCFV
is proved to be sound, but also relatively complete: every true statement about
the extensional and intentional behaviour of terms can be derived, provided all
true index term inequalities can be used as assumptions.
