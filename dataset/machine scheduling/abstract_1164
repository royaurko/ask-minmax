Phonon frequency moments and thermodynamic functions (electrostatic and
vibrational parts of the free energy, internal energy, and heat capacity) are
calculated for bcc and fcc Coulomb crystals in the harmonic approximation with
a fractional accuracy within one part on 10^5. Temperature dependence of
thermodynamic functions is fitted by analytic formulas with an accuracy of a
few parts in 10^5. The static-lattice (Madelung) part of the free energy is
calculated with an accuracy about 10^{-12}. The Madelung constant and frequency
moments of hcp crystals are also computed.
