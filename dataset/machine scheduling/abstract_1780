This paper presents a new technique for data slicing of distributed programs
running on a hierarchy of machines. Data slicing can be realized as a program
transformation that partitions heaps of machines in a hierarchy into
independent regions. Inside each region of each machine, pointers preserve the
original pointer structures in the original heap hierarchy. Each heap component
of the base type (e.g., the integer type) goes only to a region of one of the
heaps. The proposed technique has the shape of a system of inference rules. In
addition, this paper presents a simply structure type system to decide type
soundness of distributed programs. Using this type system, a mathematical proof
that the proposed slicing technique preserves typing properties is outlined in
this paper as well.
