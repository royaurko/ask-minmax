Photoelectron (PES) spectra from aluminum cluster anions (from 12 to 15
atoms) at various temperature regimes, were studied using ab-initio molecular
dynamics simulations and experimentally. The calculated PES spectra, obtained
via shifting of the simulated electronic densities of states by the
self-consistently determined values of the asymptotic exchange-correlation
potential, agree well with the measured ones, allowing reliable structural
assignments and theoretical estimation of the clusters' temperatures.
