We present a sparse linear system solver that is based on a multifrontal
variant of Gaussian elimination, and exploits low-rank approximation of the
resulting dense frontal matrices. We use hierarchically semiseparable (HSS)
matrices, which have low-rank off-diagonal blocks, to approximate the frontal
matrices. For HSS matrix construction, a randomized sampling algorithm is used
together with interpolative decompositions. The combination of the randomized
compression with a fast ULV HSS factorization leads to a solver with lower
computational complexity than the standard multifrontal method for many
applications, resulting in speedups up to 7 fold for problems in our test
suite. The implementation targets many-core systems by using task parallelism
with dynamic runtime scheduling. Numerical experiments show performance
improvements over state-of-the-art sparse direct solvers. The implementation
achieves high performance and good scalability on a range of modern shared
memory parallel systems, including the Intel Xeon Phi (MIC). The code is part
of a software package called STRUMPACK -- STRUctured Matrices PACKage, which
also has a distributed memory component for dense rank-structured matrices.
