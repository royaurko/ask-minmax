The coercivity and resistivity of a Pt/Co/AlOx/Pt junction are measured under
sustained voltage application. High bias voltages of either polarity are
determined to cause a strongly enhanced, reversible coercivity modification
compared to low voltages. Time-resolved measurements show a logarithmic
development of the coercive field in this regime, which continues over a period
as long as thirty minutes. Furthermore, the resistance of the dielectric
barrier is found to change strongly and reversibly on the same time scale,
suggesting an electrochemical process is taking place within the dielectric. It
is argued that the migration of oxygen vacancies at the magnet/oxide interface
could explain both the resistance variation and the enhanced electric field
effect at high voltages. A thermal fluctuation aftereffect model is applied to
account for the observed logarithmic dependence.
