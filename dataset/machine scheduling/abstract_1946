The Plane of our Galaxy is regularly observed by the INTEGRAL satellite by
means of scheduled scans. We present here results from the IBIS/ISGRI
instrument using data from the first two Galactic Plane Scans performed at the
end of the Performance Verification phase, while INTEGRAL was pointed towards
the Cygnus region.
  Considering the predicted IBIS sensitivity, we expected three persistent
sources to be detectable: Cyg X--1, Cyg X--3, Cyg X--2, in order of decreasing
intensity in the hard-X energy range (>15 keV). In addition to these sources,
our analysis revealed two more transient sources, confirming the unprecedented
IBIS sensitivity. For each exposure (~2200 s) of the two scans, we report on
detected source fluxes, variabilities and localisation accuracies.
