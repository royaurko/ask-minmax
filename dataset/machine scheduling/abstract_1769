We discuss the recently reported discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in the
framework of the neutron star-neutron star (NS+NS) or neutron star-black hole
(NS+BH) binary merger model. We concentrate on what we consider to be an issue
of greatest importance: what is the NS merger rate given that the FRB rate
(1/1000 yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy) is inconsistent with gamma-ray burst rate as
discussed by Thornton and should be significantly higher. We show that there is
no discrepancy between NS merger rate and observed FRB rates in the framework
of the Scenario Machine population synthesis - for a kick velocity of 100-150
km s$^{-1}$ an average NS merger rate is 1/500-1/2000 yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy up
to z = 0.5-1. Based on the Scenario Machine NS merger rate estimates, we
discuss the lack of positive detections on the ground-based interferometers,
considering the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory.
