We show that any transversally complete Riemannian foliation F of dimension
one on any possibly non-compact manifold M is tense; namely, (M,F) admits a
Riemannian metric such that the mean curvature form of F is basic. This is a
partial generalization of a result of Dominguez, which says that any Riemannian
foliation on any compact manifold is tense. Our proof is based on some results
of Molino and Sergiescu, and it is simpler than the original proof by
Dominguez. As an application, we generalize some well known results including
Masa's characterization of tautness.
