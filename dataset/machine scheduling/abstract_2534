This paper describes a time-series-based classification approach to identify
similarities between bio-medical-based situations. The proposed approach allows
classifying collections of time-series representing bio-medical measurements,
i.e., situations, regardless of the type, the length and the quantity of the
time-series a situation comprised of.
