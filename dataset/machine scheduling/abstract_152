High Speed computing meets ever increasing real-time computational demands
through the leveraging of flexibility and parallelism. The flexibility is
achieved when computing platform designed with heterogeneous resources to
support multifarious tasks of an application where as task scheduling brings
parallel processing. The efficient task scheduling is critical to obtain
optimized performance in heterogeneous computing Systems (HCS). In this paper,
we brought a review of various application scheduling models which provide
parallelism for homogeneous and heterogeneous computing systems. In this paper,
we made a review of various scheduling methodologies targeted to high speed
computing systems and also prepared summary chart. The comparative study of
scheduling methodologies for high speed computing systems has been carried out
based on the attributes of platform & application as well. The attributes are
execution time, nature of task, task handling capability, type of host &
computing platform. Finally a summary chart has been prepared and it
demonstrates that the need of developing scheduling methodologies for
Heterogeneous Reconfigurable Computing Systems (HRCS) which is an emerging high
speed computing platform for real time applications.
