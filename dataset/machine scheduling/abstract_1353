The problem of known signal detection in Additive White Gaussian Noise is
considered. In previous work, a new detection scheme was introduced by the
contributors, and it was demonstrated that optimum performance cannot be reached in
a real implementation. In this paper we analyse Support Vector Machines (SVM)
as an alternative, evaluating the results in terms of Probability of detection
curves for a fixed Probability of false alarm.
