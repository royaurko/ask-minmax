We present iSAPP (Imperative Static Analyser for Probabilistic Polynomial
Time), a complexity verifier tool that is sound and extensionally complete for
the Probabilistic Polynomial Time (PP) complexity class. iSAPP works on an
imperative programming language for stack machines. The certificate of
polynomiality can be built in polytime, with respect to the number of stacks
used.
