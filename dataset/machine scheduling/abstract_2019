The MARS15 Monte Carlo code capabilities to deal with time-consuming deep
penetration shielding problems and other computationally tough tasks in
accelerator, detector and shielding applications, have been enhanced by a
parallel processing option. It has been developed, implemented and tested on
the Fermilab Accelerator Division Linux cluster and network of Sun
workstations. The code uses MPI. It is scalable and demonstrates good
performance. The general architecture of the code, specific uses of message
passing, and effects of a scheduling on the performance and fault tolerance are
described.
