Techniques and strategies for discovering and measuring the properties of
Higgs bosons via $s$-channel production at a $\mu^+\mu^-$ collider, and the
associated requirements for the machine and detector, are discussed in detail.
The unique feature of $s$-channel production is that, with good energy
resolution, the mass, total width and partial widths of a Higgs boson can be
directly measured with remarkable accuracy in most cases. For the expected
machine parameters and luminosity the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson $\hsm$,
with mass $\lsim 2\mw$, the light $\hl$ of the minimal supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM), and the heavier MSSM Higgs bosons (the CP-odd $\ha$ and the
CP-even $\hh$) can all be studied in the $s$-channel, with the heavier states
accessible up to the maximal $\sqrt s$ over a large fraction of the MSSM
parameter space. In addition, it may be possible to discover the $\ha$ and
$\hh$ by running the collider at full energy and observing excess events in the
bremsstrahlung tail at lower energy. The integrated luminosity, beam resolution
and machine/detector features required to distinguish between the $\hsm$ and
$\hl$ are delineated.
