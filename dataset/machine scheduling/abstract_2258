In this paper, we consider a multi-cell multi-user MISO broadcast channel.
The system operates according to the opportunistic beamforming framework in a
multi-cell environment with variable number of transmit beams (may
alternatively be referred as the transmission rank) at each base station. The
maximum number of co-scheduled users in a cell is equal to its transmission
rank, thus increasing it will have the effect of increasing the multiplexing
gain. However, this will simultaneously increase the amount of interference in
the network, which will decrease the rate of communication. This paper focuses
on optimally setting the transmission rank at each base station such that a set
of Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, that will ensure a guaranteed minimum
rate per beam at each base station, is not violated. Expressions representing
the achievable region of transmission ranks are obtained considering different
network settings. The achievable transmission rank region consists of all
achievable transmission rank tuples that satisfy the QoS constraints. Numerical
results are also presented to provide further insights on the feasibility
problem.
