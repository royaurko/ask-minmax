We consider the following special case of minimizing makespan. A set of jobs
$J$ and a set of machines $M$ are given. Each job $j \in J$ can be scheduled on
a machine from a subset $M_j$ of $M$. The processing time of $j$ is the same on
all machines in $M_j.$ The jobs are of two sizes, namely $b$ (big) and $s$
(small). We present a polynomial-time algorithm that approximates the value of
the optimal makespan within a factor of 1.883 and some further improvements
when every job can be scheduled on at most two machines.
