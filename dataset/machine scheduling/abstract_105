IaaS clouds invest substantial capital in operating their data centers.
Reducing the cost of resource provisioning, is their forever pursuing goal.
Computing resource trading among multiple IaaS clouds provide a potential for
IaaS clouds to utilize cheaper resources to fulfill their jobs, by exploiting
the diversities of different clouds' workloads and operational costs. In this
paper, we focus on studying the IaaS clouds' cost reduction through computing
resource trading among multiple IaaS clouds. We formulate the global cost
minimization problem among multiple IaaS clouds under cooperative scenario
where each individual cloud's workload and cost information is known. Taking
into consideration jobs with disparate lengths, a non-preemptive approximation
algorithm for leftover job migration and new job scheduling is designed. Given
to the selfishness of individual clouds, we further design a randomized double
auction mechanism to elicit clouds' truthful bidding for buying or selling
virtual machines. We evaluate our algorithms using trace-driven simulations.
