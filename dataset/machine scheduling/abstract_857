One of the possible mechanisms for acoustic emission of growing micro-cracks
under conditions of the material machining by com-pressed abrasive has been
theoretically studied. Physical ground of this mechanism is the dislocation
creep in the field of instant contact temperature on stage of micro-cutting
with appearance of the wedge-shaped cavity. It has been shown that the energy
density for radiated acoustic wave at the moment when the cavity is opened
essentially depends on parameters of the material abrasive machining.
