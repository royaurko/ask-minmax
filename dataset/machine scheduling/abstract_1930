PKS 2155--304 is one of the brightest blazars in the X-ray band. It was
repeatedly monitored with BeppoSax during three long campaigns of about 2 days
each in November of 1996, 1997 and 1999. The source underwent different states
of intensity and was clearly variable with successive flares detected. This
paper presents temporal and spectral analysis to study the X-ray variability
trends for a blazar. The rich phenomenology is interpreted in the context of a
model where relativistic electrons are accelerated through internal shocks
taking place in the jets. The most important parameter turns out to be the
initial time interval between the two shells ejected from the central engine to
produce the flare, which may determine the structure of the shock and in turn
the physical quantities of the emitting region to reproduce the observed trends
of the X-ray variability (abridged).
