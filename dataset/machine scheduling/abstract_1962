In the 1970s, the Narrabri intensity interferometer was used to measure 32
stellar diameters; some as small as 0.4 milli-arc-seconds (mas). The
interferometer consisted of a pair of 6.5m telescopes with relatively crude
optics, similar to those currently in use as Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
(ACT). We explore the possibility of implementing a modern intensity
interferometer on an ACT array. Developments in fast digital signal processing
technology now make such a system relatively easy to implement, and provide
improved sensitivity. Allowing measurements at short wavelength (<400nm), with
long baselines (> 100m), which are still challenging for Michelson
interferometers, present ACT arrays could be used to probe angular structures
as small as ~0.2mas, and smaller with large array projects already being
discussed. This would provide measurements of stellar diameters, binary
systems, circumstellar environments and, possibly, stellar surface features.
ACT arrays could be used as intensity interferometers during bright moon
periods, providing valuable scientific output for little expense and no impact
on the gamma-ray observing schedule.
