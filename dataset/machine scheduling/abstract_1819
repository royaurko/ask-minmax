Although stochastic approximation learning methods have been widely used in
the machine learning literature for over 50 years, formal theoretical analyses
of specific machine learning algorithms are less common because stochastic
approximation theorems typically possess assumptions which are difficult to
communicate and verify. This paper presents a new stochastic approximation
theorem for state-dependent noise with easily verifiable assumptions applicable
to the analysis and design of important deep learning algorithms including:
adaptive learning, contrastive divergence learning, stochastic descent
expectation maximization, and active learning.
