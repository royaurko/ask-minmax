Alghoritms: HIEROCRYPT-3, CAMELLIA and ANUBIS, GRAND CRU, NOEKEON, NUSH, Q,
RC6, SAFER++128, SC2000, SHACAL were requested for the submission of block
ciphers (high level block cipher) to NESSIE (New European Schemes for
Signatures, Integrity, and Encryption) project. The main purpose of this
project was to put forward a portfolio of strong cryptographic primitives of
various types. The NESSIE project was a three year long project and has been
divided into two phases. The first was finished in June 2001r. CAMELLIA, RC6,
SAFER++128 and SHACAL were accepted for the second phase of the evaluation
process. HIEROCRYPT-3 had key schedule problems, and there were attacks for up
to 3,5 rounds out of 6, at least hardware implementations of this cipher were
extremely slow [12]. HIEROCRYPT-3 was not selected to Phase II. CAMELLIA was
selected as an algorithm suggested for future standard. In the paper we present
the hardware implementations these two algorithms with 128-bit blocks and
128-bit keys, using ALTERA devices and their comparisons.
