Reinhardt's conjecture, a formalization of the statement that a truthful
knowing machine can know its own truthfulness and mechanicalness, was proved by
Carlson using sophisticated structural results about the ordinals and
transfinite induction just beyond the first epsilon number. We prove a weaker
version of the conjecture, by elementary methods and transfinite induction up
to a smaller ordinal.
