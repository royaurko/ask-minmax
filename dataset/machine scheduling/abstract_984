When I first encountered PAC-Bayesian concentration inequalities they seemed
to me to be rather disconnected from good old-fashioned results like
Hoeffding's and Bernstein's inequalities. But, at least for one flavour of the
PAC-Bayesian bounds, there is actually a very close relation, and the main
innovation is a continuous version of the union bound, along with some
ingenious applications. Here's the gist of what's going on, presented from a
machine learning perspective.
