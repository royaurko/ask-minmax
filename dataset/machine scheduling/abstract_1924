MONS is the scientific project on the Danish Roemer satellite mission, which
is being developed as part of the Danish Small Satellite Programme. The
principal goal is to study solar-like oscillations in around 20 bright stars,
with a precision that in the best cases will be limited only by the intrinsic
stellar `noise'. The baseline orbit, a so-called Molniya orbit, allows access
to essentially the entire sky during the planned 2-year mission. The main
instrument is a short-focus reflecting telescope with an aperture of 32 cm,
making two-colour measurements. A focused Field Monitor will be used to detect
and correct for possible faint variable stars of substantial amplitude near the
main target. In addition the Field Monitor, and the Star Trackers on the
platform, may be used to observe a broad range of variable phenomena. The
project has concluded the Systems Definition Phase by a successful review, and
launch is scheduled for the middle of 2005.
