Purpose: To derive a clinically-practical margin formula between clinical
target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) for single-fraction
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).Methods: In previous publications on the margin
between the CTV and the PTV, a Gaussian function with zero mean was assumed for
the systematic error and the ma-chine systematic error was completely ignored.
In this work we adopted a Dirac delta function for the machine system-atic
error for a given machine with nonzero mean systematic error. Mathematical
formulas for calculating the CTV-PTV margin for single-fraction SRS treatments
were proposed. Results: Margins for single fraction treatments were derived
such that the CTVs received the prescribed dose in 95% of the SRS patients. The
margin defined in this study was machine specific and accounted for nonzero
mean systematic error. The differences between our formulas and a previously
published formula were discussed. Conclusion: Clinical margin formulas were
proposed for deter-mining the margin between the CTV and the PTV in SRS
treatments. Previous margin's recipes, being derived specifi-cally for
conventional treatments, may be inappropriate for single-fraction SRS and could
result in geometric miss of the target and even treatment failure for machines
possessing of large systematic errors.
