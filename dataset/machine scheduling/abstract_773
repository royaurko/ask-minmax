This paper proposes an adaptive multi-mode transmission strategy to improve
the spectral efficiency achieved in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
broadcast channel with delayed and quantized channel state information. The
adaptive strategy adjusts the number of active users, denoted as the
transmission mode, to balance transmit array gain, spatial division
multiplexing gain, and residual inter-user interference. Accurate closed-form
approximations are derived for the achievable rates for different modes, which
help identify the active mode that maximizes the average sum throughput for
given feedback delay and channel quantization error. The proposed transmission
strategy is combined with round-robin scheduling, and is shown to provide
throughput gain over single-user MIMO at moderate signal-to-noise ratio. It
only requires feedback of instantaneous channel state information from a small
number of users. With a feedback load constraint, the proposed algorithm
provides performance close to that achieved by opportunistic scheduling with
instantaneous feedback from a large number of users.
