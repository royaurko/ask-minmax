Real time systems are systems in which there is a commitment for timely
response by the computer to external stimuli. Real time applications have to
function correctly even in presence of faults. Fault tolerance can be achieved
by either hardware or software or time redundancy. Safety-critical applications
have strict time and cost constraints, which means that not only faults have to
be tolerated but also the constraints should be satisfied. Deadline scheduling
means that the taskwith the earliest required response time is processed. The
most common scheduling algorithms are :Rate Monotonic(RM) and Earliest deadline
first(EDF).This paper deals with the interaction between the fault tolerant
strategy and the EDF real time scheduling strategy.
