One of the main issues in the design of sensor networks is energy efficient
communication of time-critical data. Energy wastage can be caused by failed
packet transmission attempts at each node due to channel dynamics and
interference. Therefore transmission control techniques that are unaware of the
channel dynamics can lead to suboptimal channel use patterns. In this paper we
propose a transmission controller that utilizes different "grades" of channel
side information to schedule packet transmissions in an optimal way, while
meeting a deadline constraint for all packets waiting in the transmission
queue. The wireless channel is modeled as a finite-state Markov channel. We are
specifically interested in the case where the transmitter has low-grade channel
side information that can be obtained based solely on the ACK/NAK sequence for
the previous transmissions. Our scheduler is readily implementable and it is
based on the dynamic programming solution to the finite-horizon transmission
control problem. We also calculate the information theoretic capacity of the
finite state Markov channel with feedback containing different grades of
channel side information including that, obtained through the ACK/NAK sequence.
We illustrate that our scheduler achieves a given throughput at a power level
that is fairly close to the fundamental limit achievable over the channel.
