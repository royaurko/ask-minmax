Threats from the internet, particularly malicious software (i.e., malware)
often use cryptographic algorithms to disguise their actions and even to take
control of a victim's system (as in the case of ransomware). Malware and other
threats proliferate too quickly for the time-consuming traditional methods of
binary analysis to be effective. By automating detection and classification of
cryptographic algorithms, we can speed program analysis and more efficiently
combat malware.
  This thesis will present several methods of leveraging machine learning to
automatically discover and classify cryptographic algorithms in compiled binary
programs.
  While further work is necessary to fully evaluate these methods on real-world
binary programs, the results in this paper suggest that machine learning can be
used successfully to detect and identify cryptographic primitives in compiled
code. Currently, these techniques successfully detect and classify
cryptographic algorithms in small single-purpose programs, and further work is
proposed to apply them to real-world examples.
