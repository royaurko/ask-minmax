We carry out a comparative performance study of multi-core CPUs, GPUs and
Intel Xeon Phi (Many Integrated Core - MIC) with a microscopy image analysis
application. We experimentally evaluate the performance of computing devices on
core operations of the application. We correlate the observed performance with
the characteristics of computing devices and data access patterns, computation
complexities, and parallelization forms of the operations. The results show a
significant variability in the performance of operations with respect to the
device used. The performances of operations with regular data access are
comparable or sometimes better on a MIC than that on a GPU. GPUs are more
efficient than MICs for operations that access data irregularly, because of the
lower bandwidth of the MIC for random data accesses. We propose new
performance-aware scheduling strategies that consider variabilities in
operation speedups. Our scheduling strategies significantly improve application
performance compared to classic strategies in hybrid configurations.
