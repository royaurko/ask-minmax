e-Motions is an Eclipse-based visual timed model transformation framework
with a Real-Time Maude semantics that supports the usual Maude formal analysis
methods, including simulation, reachability analysis, and LTL model checking.
e-Motions is characterized by a novel and powerful set of constructs for
expressing timed behaviors. In this paper we illustrate the use of these
constructs --- and thereby implicitly investigate their suitability to define
real-time systems in an intuitive way --- to define and formally analyze two
prototypical and very different real-time systems: (i) a simple round trip time
protocol for computing the time it takes a message to travel from one node to
another, and back; and (ii) the EDF scheduling algorithm.
