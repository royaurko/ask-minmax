Recently Java programming environment has become so popular. Java programming
language is a language that is designed to be portable enough to be executed in
wide range of computers ranging from cell phones to supercomputers. Computer
programs written in Java are compiled into Java Byte code instructions that are
suitable for execution by a Java Virtual Machine implementation. Java virtual
Machine is commonly implemented in software by means of an interpreter for the
Java Virtual Machine instruction set. As an object oriented language, Java
utilizes the concept of objects. Our idea is to identify the candidate objects'
references in a Java environment through hierarchical cluster analysis using
reference stack and execution stack.
