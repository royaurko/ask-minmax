Quantum corrections to the conductivity allow experimental assessment of
electronic coherence in metals. We consider whether independent measurements of
different corrections are quantitatively consistent, particularly in systems
with spin-orbit or magnetic impurity scattering. We report weak localization
and time-dependent universal conductance fluctuation data in quasi-one- and
two-dimensional AuPd wires between 2 K and 20 K. The data inferred from both
methods are in excellent quantitative agreement, implying that precisely the
same coherence length is relevant to both corrections.
