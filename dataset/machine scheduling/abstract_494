This paper studies the problem of relay-assisted user scheduling for downlink
wireless transmission. The base station or access point employs hybrid
automatic-repeat-request (HARQ) with the assistance of a set of fixed relays to
serve a set of mobile users. By minimizing a cost function of the queue lengths
at the base station and the number of retransmissions of the head-of-line
packet for each user, the base station can schedule an appropriate user in each
time slot and an appropriate transmitter to serve it. It is shown that a
priority-index policy is optimal for a linear cost function with packets
arriving according to a Poisson process and for an increasing convex cost
function where packets must be drained from the queues at the base station.
