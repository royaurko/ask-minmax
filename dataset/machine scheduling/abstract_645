Opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes with reduced feedback are
proposed for MIMO-OFDMA downlink systems. Unlike the conventional beamforming
schemes in which beamforming is implemented solely by the base station (BS) in
a per-subcarrier fashion, the proposed schemes take advantages of a novel
channel decomposition technique to perform beamforming jointly by the BS and
the mobile terminal (MT). The resulting beamforming schemes allow the BS to
employ only {\em one} beamforming matrix (BFM) to form beams for {\em all}
subcarriers while each MT completes the beamforming task for each subcarrier
locally. Consequently, for a MIMO-OFDMA system with $Q$ subcarriers, the
proposed opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes require only one BFM
index and $Q$ supportable throughputs to be returned from each MT to the BS, in
contrast to $Q$ BFM indices and $Q$ supportable throughputs required by the
conventional schemes. The advantage of the proposed schemes becomes more
evident when a further feedback reduction is achieved by grouping adjacent
subcarriers into exclusive clusters and returning only cluster information from
each MT. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed reduced-feedback schemes.
