This paper deals with the impact of fault prediction techniques on
checkpointing strategies. We suppose that the fault-prediction system provides
prediction windows instead of exact predictions, which dramatically complicates
the analysis of the checkpointing strategies. We propose a new approach based
upon two periodic modes, a regular mode outside prediction windows, and a
proactive mode inside prediction windows, whenever the size of these windows is
large enough. We are able to compute the best period for any size of the
prediction windows, thereby deriving the scheduling strategy that minimizes
platform waste. In addition, the results of this analytical evaluation are
nicely corroborated by a comprehensive set of simulations, which demonstrate
the validity of the model and the accuracy of the approach.
