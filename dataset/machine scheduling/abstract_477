The problem of scheduling sensor transmissions for the detection of
correlated random fields using spatially deployed sensors is considered. Using
the large deviations principle, a closed-form expression for the error exponent
of the miss probability is given as a function of the sensor spacing and
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is shown that the error exponent has a distinct
characteristic: at high SNR, the error exponent is monotonically increasing
with respect to sensor spacing, while at low SNR there is an optimal spacing
for scheduled sensors.
