We wish to present a mirrored language structure (MLS) and four logic rules
determined by this structure for the model of a computable Oracle Turing
machine. MLS has novel features that are of considerable biological and
computational significance. It suggests an algorithm of relation learning and
recognition (RLR) that enables the deterministic computers to simulate the
mechanism of the Oracle Turing machine, or P = NP in a mathematical term.
