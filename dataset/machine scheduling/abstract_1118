We summarize the observed properties of the CHVC population, which provide
strong evidence for source distances in the range 200-1000 kpc. At these
distances, the population corresponds to strongly dark-matter dominated
sub-dwarf galaxies still accreting onto the more massive Local Group systems.
Recent searches for faint associated stellar populations have revealed
red-giant candidates for which follow-up spectroscopy is scheduled. A sensitive
HI survey for CHVC counterparts in the NGC 628 galaxy group has allowed
tentative detection of 40 candidates, for which confirming observations have
been approved. Many open issues should be resolved by observational programs
within the coming years.
