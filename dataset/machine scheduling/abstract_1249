The traditional virtual machine building and and deployment process is
centered around the virtual machine hard disk image. The packages comprising
the VM operating system are carefully selected, hard disk images are built for
a variety of different hypervisors, and images have to be distributed and
decompressed in order to instantiate a virtual machine. Within the HEP
community, the CernVM File System has been established in order to decouple the
distribution from the experiment software from the building and distribution of
the VM hard disk images.
  We show how to get rid of such pre-built hard disk images altogether. Due to
the high requirements on POSIX compliance imposed by HEP application software,
CernVM-FS can also be used to host and boot a Linux operating system. This
allows the use of a tiny bootable CD image that comprises only a Linux kernel
while the rest of the operating system is provided on demand by CernVM-FS. This
approach speeds up the initial instantiation time and reduces virtual machine
image sizes by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, security updates can be
distributed instantaneously through CernVM-FS. By leveraging the fact that
CernVM-FS is a versioning file system, a historic analysis environment can be
easily re-spawned by selecting the corresponding CernVM-FS file system
snapshot.
