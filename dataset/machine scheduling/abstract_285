Embedded hard real time systems require substantial amount of emergency
processing power for the management of large scale systems like a nuclear power
plant under the threat of an earth quake or a future transport systems under a
peril. In order to meet a fully coordinated supervisory control of multiple
domains of a large scale system, it requires the scenario of engaging
multiprocessor real time design. There are various types of scheduling schemes
existing for meeting the critical task assignment in multiple processor
environments and it requires the tracking of faulty conditions of the subsystem
to avoid system underperformance from failure patterns. Hybrid scheduling
usually engages a combined scheduling philosophy comprising of a static
scheduling of a set of tasks and a highly pre-emptive scheduling for another
set of tasks in different situations of process control. There are instances
where highly critical tasks need to be introduced at a least expected
catastrophe and it cannot be ensured to meet all deadline in selected
processors because of the arrival pattern of such tasks and they bear low
tolerance of time to meet the required target. In such circumstances an
effective switching of processors for this set of task is feasible and we
describe a method to achieve this effectively.
