We analyze opportunistic schemes for transmission scheduling from one of $n$
homogeneous queues whose channel states fluctuate independently. Considered
schemes consist of the LCQ policy, which transmits from a longest connected
queue in the entire system, and its low-complexity variants that transmit from
a longest queue within a randomly chosen subset of connected queues. A
Markovian model is studied where mean packet transmission time is $n^{-1}$ and
packet arrival rate is $\lambda<1$ per queue. Transient and equilibrium
distributions of queue occupancies are obtained in the limit as the system size
$n$ tends to infinity.
