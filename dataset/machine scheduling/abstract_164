In this work, we design a deleting machine and shown that for some given
condition on machine parameters, it gives slightly better result than P-B
deleting machine [5,6]. Also it is shown that for some particular values of the
machine parameters it acts like Pati-Braunstein deleting machine. We also study
the combined effect of cloning and deleting machine, where at first the cloning
is done by some standard cloning machines such as Wootters-Zurek [1] and
Buzek-Hillery [2] cloning machine and then the copy mode is deleted by
Pati-Braunstein deleting machine or our prescribed deleting machine. After that
we examine the distortion of the input state and the fidelity of deletion .
