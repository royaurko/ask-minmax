We introduce a new approach to take into account the memory architecture and
the memory mapping in High- Level Synthesis for data intensive applications. We
formalize the memory mapping as a set of constraints for the synthesis, and
defined a Memory Constraint Graph and an accessibility criterion to be used in
the scheduling step. We use a memory mapping file to include those memory
constraints in our HLS tool GAUT. It is possible, with the help of GAUT, to
explore a wide range of solutions, and to reach a good tradeoff between time,
power-consumption, and area.
