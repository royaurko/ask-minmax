Most of energy efficiency and carbon reduction initiatives and concepts
attempt to regulate and optimize machines behavior, and therefore, human
behavior itself is left neglected. Although most of energy and resource
consumption is the result of machines functioning and behavior (including
domesticated animals such as cows), these behaviors themselves are actually in
answer to humans demands and needs, and therefore, can be considered the
indirect results of humans behavior. Resolving the source of problems, i.e.,
the unhealthy human behavior, not only reduces these footprints including
energy and water consumption, and GHG emissions, it also helps increasing the
quality of life in society. Here, we propose an approach which focuses on
adjusting humans behavior toward eliminating unnecessary demand on the machines
that consequently lowers the consumption. This goal is achieved by creating a
social environment in which directed and selective interactions help humans to
adjust to healthier behavior. The solution consists of human-friendly
interfaces and also artificial intelligence software in order to learn and
emulate human interactions.
