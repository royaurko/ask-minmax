This paper describes a consequence of the more general results of a previous
paper which is of independent interest. We construct a functor from the
category of dendroidal sets, which models the theory of infinity-operads, into
the category of E-infinity-spaces. Applying May's infinite loop space machine
for E-infinity-spaces then gives an infinite loop space machine for
infinity-operads. We show that our machine exhibits the homotopy theory of
E-infinity-spaces as a localization of the homotopy theory of infinity-operads.
