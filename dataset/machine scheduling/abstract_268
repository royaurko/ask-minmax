This report presents an algorithm to statically schedule live and strongly
connected Marked Graphs (MG). The proposed algorithm computes the best
execution where the execution rate is maximal and place sizes are minimal. The
proposed algorithm provides transition schedules represented as binary words.
These words are chosen to be balanced. The contributions of this paper is the
proposed algorithm itself along with the characterization of the best execution
of any MG.
