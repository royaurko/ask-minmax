The LHC detectors are well into their construction phase. The LHC schedule
shows first beam to ATLAS and CMS in 2007. Because the LHC accelerator has
begun to plan for a ten fold increase in LHC design luminosity (the SLHC or
super LHC) it is none too soon to begin to think about the upgrades which will
be required of the present LHC detectors. In particular, the tracking systems
of ATLAS and CMS will need to be completely rebuilt. Given the time needed to
do the R&D, make prototypes, and construct the new detectors and given the
accelerator schedule for the SLHC, work needs to begin rather soon.
