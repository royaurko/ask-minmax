Protein machines often exhibit long range interplay between different sites
in order to achieve their biological tasks. We investigate and characterize the
non--linear energy localization and the basic mechanisms of energy transfer in
protein devices. By studying two different model protein machines, with
different biological functions, we show that genuinely non--linear phenomena
are responsible for energy transport between the different machine sites
involved in the biological functions. The energy transfer turns out to be
extremely efficient from an energetic point of view: by changing the energy
initially provided to the model device, we identify a well defined range of
energies where the time for the energy transport to occur is minimal and the
amount of transferred energy is maximum. Furthermore, by introducing an
implicit solvent, we show that the energy is localized on the internal residues
of the protein structure, thus minimizing the dissipation.
