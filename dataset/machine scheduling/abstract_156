For a closed-loop system, which has a contention-based multiple access
network on its sensor link, the Medium Access Controller (MAC) may discard some
packets when the traffic on the link is high. We use a local state-based
scheduler to select a few critical data packets to send to the MAC. In this
paper, we analyze the impact of such a scheduler on the closed-loop system in
the presence of traffic, and show that there is a dual effect with state-based
scheduling. In general, this makes the optimal scheduler and controller hard to
find. However, by removing past controls from the scheduling criterion, we find
that certainty equivalence holds. This condition is related to the classical
result of Bar-Shalom and Tse, and it leads to the design of a scheduler with a
certainty equivalent controller. This design, however, does not result in an
equivalent system to the original problem, in the sense of Witsenhausen.
Computing the estimate is difficult, but can be simplified by introducing a
symmetry constraint on the scheduler. Based on these findings, we propose a
dual predictor architecture for the closed-loop system, which ensures
separation between scheduler, observer and controller. We present an example of
this architecture, which illustrates a network-aware event-triggering
mechanism.
