We show explicitly that traversable wormholes requiring exotic matter in
4-dimensions nevertheless have acceptable stress-tensors obeying reasonable
energy conditions in higher dimensions if the wormholes are regarded as being
embedded in higher dimensional space-times satisfying Einstein's field
equations. From the 4-dimensional perspective, the existence of higher
dimensions may thus facilitate wormhole and time-machine constructions through
access to "exotic matter".
