Cloud Computing is the latest blooming technology in the era of Computer
Science and Information Technology domain. There is an enormous pool of data
centres, which are termed as Clouds where the services and associated data are
being deployed and users need a constant Internet connection to access them.
One of the highlights in Cloud is the delivering of applications or services in
an on-demand environment. One of the most promising areas in Cloud scheduling
is Scheduling of workflows which is intended to match the request of the user
to the appropriate resources. There are several algorithms to automate the
workflows in a way to satisfy the Quality of service (QoS) of the user among
which deadline is considered as a major criterion, i.e. Satisfying the needs of
the user with minimized cost and within the minimum stipulated time. This paper
surveys various workflow scheduling algorithms that have a deadline as its
criterion.
