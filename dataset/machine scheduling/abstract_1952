Chandra serendipitously observed the eclipsing (80 deg < i < 84 deg)
intermediate polar, XY Arietis (=H0253+193), in two separate but continuous
observations five weeks apart. XY Ari was in a quiescent state during both
observations. We pursue the study of phase-resolved spectra for this system
focusing on the Fe K lines. From the combined and separate data sets, we
readily detect emission lines of iron near 6.4, 6.7, and 6.9 keV at better than
99% significance in contrast to previous results. We confirm the orbit-phased
sinusoidal absorption column behavior first observed with Ginga as well as a
sinusoid-like behavior as a function of spin phase. The presence of the 6.4,
6.7, and 6.9 keV lines requires different ionization states with xi <2 (6.4
keV) and xi \sim$3.5-4 (6.7 and 6.9 keV) that must vary with phase. We also
detect emission lines at 3.25, 4.8, and 5.4 keV that are not instrumental in
origin. The 4.8 keV line may be identified as Ca XIX (4.832 keV) and the 3.25
keV line may be Ar I K, but the 5.4 keV line has no obvious identification.
