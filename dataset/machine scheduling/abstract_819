In this paper with the aid of genetic algorithm and fuzzy theory, we present
a hybrid job scheduling approach, which considers the load balancing of the
system and reduces total execution time and execution cost. We try to modify
the standard Genetic algorithm and to reduce the iteration of creating
population with the aid of fuzzy theory. The main goal of this research is to
assign the jobs to the resources with considering the VM MIPS and length of
jobs. The new algorithm assigns the jobs to the resources with considering the
job length and resources capacities. We evaluate the performance of our
approach with some famous cloud scheduling models. The results of the
experiments show the efficiency of the proposed approach in term of execution
time, execution cost and average Degree of Imbalance (DI).
