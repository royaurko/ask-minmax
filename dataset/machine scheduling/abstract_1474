Artificial Intelligence began as a field probing some of the most fundamental
questions of science - the nature of intelligence and the design of intelligent
artifacts. But it has grown into a discipline that is deeply entwined with
commerce and society. Today's AI technology, such as expert systems and
intelligent assistants, pose some difficult questions of risk, trust and
accountability. In this paper, we present these concerns, examining them in the
context of historical developments that have shaped the nature and direction of
AI research. We also suggest the exploration and further development of two
paradigms, human intelligence-machine cooperation, and a sociological view of
intelligence, which might help address some of these concerns.
