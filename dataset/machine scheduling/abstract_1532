A wide variety of problems in machine learning, including exemplar
clustering, document summarization, and sensor placement, can be cast as
constrained submodular maximization problems. Unfortunately, the resulting
submodular optimization problems are often too large to be solved on a single
machine. We develop a simple distributed algorithm that is embarrassingly
parallel and it achieves provable, constant factor, worst-case approximation
guarantees. In our experiments, we demonstrate its efficiency in large problems
with different kinds of constraints with objective values always close to what
is achievable in the centralized setting.
