Improved knowledge of diffuse Galactic emission is important to maximize the
scientific return from scheduled CMB anisotropy missions. Cross-correlation of
microwave maps with maps of the far-IR dust continuum show a ubiquitous
microwave emission component whose spatial distribution is traced by far-IR
dust emission. The spectral index of this emission, beta_{radio} = -2.2 (+0.5
-0.7) is suggestive of free-free emission but does not preclude other
candidates. Comparison of H-alpha and microwave results show that both data
sets have positive correlations with the far-IR dust emission. Microwave data,
however, are consistently brighter than can be explained solely from free-free
emission traced by H-alpha. This ``anomalous'' microwave emission can be
explained as electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. The
anomalous component at 53 GHz is 2.5 times as bright as the free-free emission
traced by H-alpha, providing an approximate normalization for models with
significant spinning dust emission.
