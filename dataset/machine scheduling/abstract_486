The aim of this research is twofold: Firstly, to model and solve a complex
nurse scheduling problem with an integer programming formulation and
evolutionary algorithms. Secondly, to detail a novel statistical method of
comparing and hence building better scheduling algorithms by identifying
successful algorithm modifications. The comparison method captures the results
of algorithms in a single figure that can then be compared using traditional
statistical techniques. Thus, the proposed method of comparing algorithms is an
objective procedure designed to assist in the process of improving an
algorithm. This is achieved even when some results are non-numeric or missing
due to infeasibility. The final algorithm outperforms all previous evolutionary
algorithms, which relied on human expertise for modification.
