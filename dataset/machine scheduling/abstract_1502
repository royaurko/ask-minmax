This paper adapts a recently developed regularized stochastic version of the
Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton method for the
solution of support vector machine classification problems. The proposed method
is shown to converge almost surely to the optimal classifier at a rate that is
linear in expectation. Numerical results show that the proposed method exhibits
a convergence rate that degrades smoothly with the dimensionality of the
feature vectors.
