We show the equivalence between a probabilistic Turing machine and the time
evolution of a one-dimensional Ising model, the Glauber model in one dimension,
equilibrium positions representing the results of computations of the Turing
machine. This equivalence permits to map a physical system on a computational
system providing in this way an evaluation of the entropy at the end of
computation. The result agrees with Landauer limit.
