We consider the following problem for various infinite time machines. If a
real is computable relative to large set of oracles such as a set of full
measure or just of positive measure, a comeager set, or a nonmeager Borel set,
is it already computable? We show that the answer is independent from ZFC for
ordinal time machines (OTMs) with and without ordinal parameters and give a
positive answer for most other machines. For instance, we consider, infinite
time Turing machines (ITTMs), unresetting and resetting infinite time register
machines (wITRMs, ITRMs), and \alpha-Turing machines for countable admissible
ordinals \alpha.
