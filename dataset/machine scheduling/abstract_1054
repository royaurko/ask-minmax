We describe discrete restricted Boltzmann machines: probabilistic graphical
models with bipartite interactions between visible and hidden discrete
variables. Examples are binary restricted Boltzmann machines and discrete naive
Bayes models. We detail the inference functions and distributed representations
arising in these models in terms of configurations of projected products of
simplices and normal fans of products of simplices. We bound the number of
hidden variables, depending on the cardinalities of their state spaces, for
which these models can approximate any probability distribution on their
visible states to any given accuracy. In addition, we use algebraic methods and
coding theory to compute their dimension.
