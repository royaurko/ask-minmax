Glauber dynamics is a powerful tool to generate randomized, approximate
solutions to combinatorially difficult problems. It has been used to analyze
and design distributed CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) scheduling
algorithms for multi-hop wireless networks. In this paper we derive bounds on
the mixing time of a generalization of Glauber dynamics where multiple links
are allowed to update their states in parallel and the fugacity of each link
can be different. The results can be used to prove that the average queue
length (and hence, the delay) under the parallel Glauber dynamics based CSMA
grows polynomially in the number of links for wireless networks with
bounded-degree interference graphs when the arrival rate lies in a fraction of
the capacity region. We also show that in specific network topologies, the
low-delay capacity region can be further improved.
