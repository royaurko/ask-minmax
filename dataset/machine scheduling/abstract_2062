We consider a point process $i+\xi_i$, where $i\in \bZ$ and the $\xi_{i}$'s
are i.i.d. random variables with variance $\sigma^{2}$. This process, with a
suitable rescaling of the distribution of $\xi_i$'s, converges to the Poisson
process in total variation for large $\sigma$. We then study a simple queueing
system with our process as arrival process, and we provide a complete
analytical description of the system. Although the arrival process is very
similar to the Poisson process, due to negative autocorrelation the resulting
queue is very different from the Poisson case. We found interesting connections
of this model with the statistical mechanics of Fermi particles. This model is
motivated by air traffic systems.
