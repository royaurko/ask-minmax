We discuss the power and limitation of various "advice," when it is given
particularly to weak computational models of one-tape linear-time Turing
machines and one-way finite (state) automata. Of various advice types, we
consider deterministically-chosen advice (not necessarily algorithmically
determined) and randomly-chosen advice (according to certain probability
distributions). In particular, we show that certain weak machines can be
significantly enhanced in computational power when randomized advice is
provided in place of deterministic advice.
