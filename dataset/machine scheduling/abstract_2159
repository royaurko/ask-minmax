The development of robot control programs is a complex task. Many robots are
different in their electrical and mechanical structure which is also reflected
in the software. Specific robot software environments support the program
development, but are mainly text-based and usually applied by experts in the
field with profound knowledge of the target robot. This paper presents a
graphical programming environment which aims to ease the development of robot
control programs. In contrast to existing graphical robot programming
environments, our approach focuses on the composition of parallel action
sequences. The developed environment allows to schedule independent robot
actions on parallel execution lines and provides mechanism to avoid
side-effects of parallel actions. The developed environment is
platform-independent and based on the model-driven paradigm. The feasibility of
our approach is shown by the application of the sequencer to a simulated
service robot and a robot for educational purpose.
