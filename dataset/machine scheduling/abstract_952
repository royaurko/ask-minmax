We make a connection between classical polytopes called zonotopes and Support
Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. We combine this connection with the ellipsoid
method to give some new theoretical results on training SVMs. We also describe
some special properties of soft margin C-SVMs as parameter C goes to infinity.
