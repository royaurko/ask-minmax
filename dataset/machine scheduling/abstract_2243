Correcting for the sky signature usually requires supplementary calibration
data which are very expensive in terms of telescope time. In addition, the
scheduling flexibility is restricted as these data have to be taken usually
directly before/after the science observations due to the high variability of
the telluric absorption which depends on the state and the chemical composition
of the atmosphere at the time of observations. Therefore, a tool for sky
correction, which does not require this supplementary calibration data, saves a
significant amount of valuable telescope time and increases its efficiency. We
developed a software package aimed at performing telluric feature corrections
on the basis of synthetic absorption spectra.
