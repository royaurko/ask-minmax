Since computer was invented, people are using many devices to interact with
computer. Initially there were keyboard, mouse etc. but with the advancement of
technology, new ways are being discovered that are quite usual and natural to
the humans like stylus, touch-enable systems. In the current age of technology,
user is expected to touch the machine interface to give input. Hand gesture is
such a way to interact with machines where natural bare hand is used to
communicate without touching machine interface. It gives a feeling to user that
he is interacting in natural way to some human, not with traditional machines.
This paper presents a technique where user needs not to touch the machine
interface to draw on screen. Here hand finger draws shapes on monitor like
stylus, without touching the monitor. This method can be used in many
applications including games. The finger was used as an input device that acts
like paint-brush or finger-stylus and is used to make shapes in front of the
camera. Fingertip extraction and motion tracking were done in Matlab with real
time constraints. This work is an early attempt to replace stylus with the
natural finger without touching screen.
