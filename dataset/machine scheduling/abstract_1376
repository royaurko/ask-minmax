The current status of the 2mrad crossing angle layout for the ILC is
reviewed. The scheme developed in the UK and France is described and the
performance discussed for a TeV machine. Secondly, the scheme developed at SLAC
and BNL is then studied and modified for a TeV machine. We find that both
schemes can handle the higher energy beam with modifications, and share many
common features.
