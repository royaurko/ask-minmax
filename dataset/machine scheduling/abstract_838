In this paper I will discuss the properties of the Algorithmic Complexity,
presenting the most relevant properties. The related concept of logical depth
is also introduced. These properties will be used to study the problem of
learning from example, paying a special attention to machine learning. We
introduce the propensity of a machine to learn a rule and we use it define the
intelligence of a machine.
