The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a primitive kernel in numerous fields of
science and engineering. OpenFFT is an open-source parallel package for 3-D
FFTs, built on a communication-optimal domain decomposition method for
achieving minimal volume of communication. In this paper, we analyze and tune
the performance of OpenFFT, paying a particular attention to tuning of
communication that dominates the run time of large-scale calculations. We first
analyze its performance on different machines for an understanding of the
behaviors of the package and machines. Based on the performance analysis, we
develop six communication methods for performing communication with the aim of
covering varied calculation scales on a variety of computational platforms.
OpenFFT is then augmented with an auto-tuning of communication to select the
best method in run time depending on their performance. Numerical results
demonstrate that the optimized OpenFFT is able to deliver relatively good
performance in comparison with other state-of-the-art packages at different
computational scales on a number of parallel machines.
