We investigate the mutation-selection dynamics for an evolutionary
computation model based on Turing Machines that we introduced in a previous
article.
  The use of Turing Machines allows for very simple mechanisms of code growth
and code activation/inactivation through point mutations. To any value of the
point mutation probability corresponds a maximum amount of active code that can
be maintained by selection and the Turing machines that reach it are said to be
at the error threshold. Simulations with our model show that the Turing
machines population evolve towards the error threshold.
  Mathematical descriptions of the model point out that this behaviour is due
more to the mutation-selection dynamics than to the intrinsic nature of the
Turing machines. This indicates that this result is much more general than the
model considered here and could play a role also in biological evolution.
