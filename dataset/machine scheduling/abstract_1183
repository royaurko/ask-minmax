We give a description of the construction of Chevalley supergroups, providing
some explanatory examples. We avoid the discussion of the $A(1,1)$, $P(3)$ and
$Q(n)$ cases, for which our construction holds, but the exposition becomes more
complicated. We shall not in general provide complete proofs for our
statements, instead we will make an effort to convey the key ideas underlying
our construction. A fully detailed account of our work is scheduled to appear
later.
