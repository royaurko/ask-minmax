Recent advances in machine learning make it possible to design efficient
prediction algorithms for data sets with huge numbers of parameters. This paper
describes a new technique for "hedging" the predictions output by many such
algorithms, including support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, kernel
nearest neighbours, and by many other state-of-the-art methods. The hedged
predictions for the labels of new objects include quantitative measures of
their own accuracy and reliability. These measures are provably valid under the
assumption of randomness, traditional in machine learning: the objects and
their labels are assumed to be generated independently from the same
probability distribution. In particular, it becomes possible to control (up to
statistical fluctuations) the number of erroneous predictions by selecting a
suitable confidence level. Validity being achieved automatically, the remaining
goal of hedged prediction is efficiency: taking full account of the new
objects' features and other available information to produce as accurate
predictions as possible. This can be done successfully using the powerful
machinery of modern machine learning.
