The development of cryogenic technology and high temperature superconducting
(HTS) materials has seen continued interest worldwide in the development of HTS
machines since the late 1980s. In this paper, the contributors present a conceptual
design of a 2.5 MW class synchronous motor. The structure of the motor is
specified and the motor performance is analyzed via a three-dimensional model
using the finite element method (FEM). Rotor optimization is carried out to
decrease the harmonic components in the air gap field generated by HTS tapes.
Based on the results of this 3D simulation, the determination of the operating
conditions and load angle is discussed with consideration to the HTS material
properties. The economic viability of air-core and iron-core designs is
compared. The results show that this type of HTS machine has the potential to
achieve an economic, efficient and effective machine design, which operates at
a low load angle, and this design process provides a practical way to simulate
and analyze the performance of such machines.
