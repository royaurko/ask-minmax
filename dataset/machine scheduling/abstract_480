For a multiple antenna system, we compute the asymptotic distribution of
antenna selection gain when the transmitter selects the transmit antenna with
the strongest channel. We use this to asymptotically estimate the underlying
channel capacity distributions, and demonstrate that unlike
multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the channel for antenna
selection systems hardens at a slower rate, and thus a significant multiuser
scheduling gain can exist - O(1/ log m) for channel selection as opposed to
O(1/ sqrt{m}) for MIMO, where m is the number of transmit antennas.
Additionally, even without this scheduling gain, it is demonstrated that
transmit antenna selection systems outperform open loop MIMO systems in low
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) regimes, particularly for a
small number of receive antennas. This may have some implications on wireless
system design, because most of the users in modern wireless systems have low
SINRs
