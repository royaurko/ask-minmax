In this work we consider battery powered portable systems which either have
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or voltage and frequency scalable
processors as their main processing element. An application is modeled in the
form of a precedence task graph at a coarse level of granularity. We assume
that for each task in the task graph several unique design-points are available
which correspond to different hardware implementations for FPGAs and different
voltage-frequency combinations for processors. It is assumed that performance
and total power consumption estimates for each design-point are available for
any given portable platfrom, including the peripheral components such as memory
and display power usage. We present an iterative heuristic algorithm which
finds a sequence of tasks along with an appropriate design-point for each task,
such that a deadline is met and the amount of battery energy used is as small
as possible. A detailed illustrative example along with a case study of a
real-world application of a robotic arm controller which demonstrates the
usefulness of our algorithm is also presented.
