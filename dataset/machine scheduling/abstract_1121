Carbon-12 and carbon-13 abundances are measured in eleven red-giant members
of the globular cluster Omega Centauri via observations of first-overtone CO
bands near 2.3 microns. The mean value for the entire sample is <12C/13C>= 4.3
+/-0.4, with nine giants equal, within the errors, to the equilibrium ration of
12C/13C= 3.5. No correlation is found within Omega Cen between 12C/13C and the
abundance of iron. The relation between 12C/13C and other abundance ratios,
such as [O/Fe], {Na/Fe], or [Al/Fe] are also discussed.
