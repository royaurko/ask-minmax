We have initiated a three-year project to find supernovae (SNe) in a
well-defined sample of high-density southern Abell clusters with redshifts
$z\leq0.08$. These observations will provide a volume-limited sample of SNe Ia
to more than a magnitude below their peak brightness, and will enable us to:
(1) measure the luminosity function of SNe, (2) further explore the correlation
of light curve shape with the absolute luminosity of SNe Ia to better
understand SNe Ia as distance indicators, (3) measure SN rates, (4) measure the
bulk motion of the Local Group using SNe Ia, and (5) directly compare SN Ia
distances to brightest cluster galaxy distances. We use the MaCHO wide-field
2-color imager on the 1.3m telescope at Mount Stromlo to routinely monitor
$\sim 12$ clusters per week. We describe our technique for target selection and
scheduling search observations, and for finding and identifying SN candidates.
We also describe the results from the first year of our program, including the
detection of 19 SNe, several RR-Lyrae variables, and hundreds of asteroids.
