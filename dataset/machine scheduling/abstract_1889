We present the results of a near-infrared narrowband imaging survey of
planetary nebulae. Objects were selected in a way that complements similar
surveys done at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. No new detections of
molecular hydrogen emission were made. The H2 is frequently found to be
extended, except in young, visibly compact objects. Our results are consistent
with the already determined correlation of H2 emission with planetary nebula
morphological type. Filamentary and other kinds of structures are clearly
resolved in many nebulae.
