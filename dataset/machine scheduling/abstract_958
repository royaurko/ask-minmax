Using barebone PC components and NIC's, we construct a linux cluster which
has 2-dimensional mesh structure. This cluster has smaller footprint, is less
expensive, and use less power compared to conventional linux cluster. Here, we
report our experience in building such a machine and discuss our current
lattice project on the machine.
