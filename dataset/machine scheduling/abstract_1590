Two of the emerging trends in wireless cellular systems are Device-to-Device
(D2D) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. D2D enables efficient reuse
of the licensed spectrum to support localized transmissions, while M2M
connections are often characterized by fixed and low transmission rates. D2D
connections can be instrumental in localized aggregation of uplink M2M traffic
to a more capable cellular device, before being finally delivered to the Base
Station (BS). In this paper we show that a fixed M2M rate is an enabler of
efficient Machine-Type D2D underlay operation taking place simultaneously with
another \emph{downlink} cellular transmission. In the considered scenario, a BS
$B$ transmits to a user $U$, while there are $N_M$ Machine-Type Devices (MTDs)
attached to $U$, all sending simultaneously to $U$ and each using the same rate
$R_M$. While assuming that $B$ knows the channel $B-U$, but not the interfering
channels from the MTDs to $U$, we prove that there is a positive downlink rate
that can always be decoded by $U$, leading to zero-outage of the downlink
signal. This is a rather surprising consequence of the features of the multiple
access channel and the fixed rate $R_M$. We also consider the case of a
simpler, single-user decoder at $U$ with successive interference cancellation.
However, with single-user decoder, a positive zero-outage rate exists only when
$N_M=1$ and is zero when $N_M>1$. This implies that joint decoding is
instrumental in enabling fixed-rate underlay operation.
