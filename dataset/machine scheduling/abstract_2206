Base station (BS) cooperation can turn unwanted interference to useful signal
energy for enhancing system performance. In the cooperative downlink,
zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) with a simple scheduler is well known to obtain
nearly the performance of the capacity-achieving dirty-paper coding. However,
the centralized ZFBF approach is prohibitively complex as the network size
grows. In this paper, we devise message passing algorithms for realizing the
regularized ZFBF (RZFBF) in a distributed manner using belief propagation. In
the proposed methods, the overall computational cost is decomposed into many
smaller computation tasks carried out by groups of neighboring BSs and
communications is only required between neighboring BSs. More importantly, some
exchanged messages can be computed based on channel statistics rather than
instantaneous channel state information, leading to significant reduction in
computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithms converge quickly to the exact RZFBF and much faster compared to
conventional methods.
