I describe ongoing work on development of Bayesian methods for exploring
periodically varying phenomena in astronomy, addressing two classes of sources:
pulsars, and extrasolar planets (exoplanets). For pulsars, the methods aim to
detect and measure periodically varying signals in data consisting of photon
arrival times, modeled as non-homogeneous Poisson point processes. For
exoplanets, the methods address detection and estimation of planetary orbits
using observations of the reflex motion "wobble" of a host star, including
adaptive scheduling of observations to optimize inferences.
