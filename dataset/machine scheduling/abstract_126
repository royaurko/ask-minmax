Aneka is an Application Platform-as-a-Service (Aneka PaaS) for Cloud
Computing. It acts as a framework for building customized applications and
deploying them on either public or private Clouds. One of the key features of
Aneka is its support for provisioning resources on different public Cloud
providers such as Amazon EC2, Windows Azure and GoGrid. In this chapter, we
will present Aneka platform and its integration with one of the public Cloud
infrastructures, Windows Azure, which enables the usage of Windows Azure
Compute Service as a resource provider of Aneka PaaS. The integration of the
two platforms will allow users to leverage the power of Windows Azure Platform
for Aneka Cloud Computing, employing a large number of compute instances to run
their applications in parallel. Furthermore, customers of the Windows Azure
platform can benefit from the integration with Aneka PaaS by embracing the
advanced features of Aneka in terms of multiple programming models, scheduling
and management services, application execution services, accounting and pricing
services and dynamic provisioning services. Finally, in addition to the Windows
Azure Platform we will illustrate in this chapter the integration of Aneka PaaS
with other public Cloud platforms such as Amazon EC2 and GoGrid, and virtual
machine management platforms such as Xen Server. The new support of
provisioning resources on Windows Azure once again proves the adaptability,
extensibility and flexibility of Aneka.
