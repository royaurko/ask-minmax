We present an overview of Top Quark Physics - from what has been learned so
far at the Tevatron, to the searches that lie ahead at present and future
colliders. We summarize the richness of the measurements and discuss their
possible impact on our understanding of the Standard Model by pointing out
their key elements and limitations. When possible, we discuss how the top quark
may provide a connection to new or unexpected physics.
