UML state machines are widely used to specify dynamic systems behaviours.
However its semantics is described informally, thus preventing the application
of model checking techniques that could guarantee the system safety. In a
former work, we proposed a formalisation of non-concurrent UML state machines
using coloured Petri nets, so as to allow for formal verification. In this
paper, we report our experience to implement this translation in an automated
manner using the model-to-text transformation tool Acceleo. Whereas Acceleo
provides interesting features that facilitated our translation process, it also
suffers from limitations uneasy to overcome.
