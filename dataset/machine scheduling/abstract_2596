Analyzing Big Data can help corporations to im-prove their efficiency. In
this work we present a new vision to derive Value from Big Data using a
Semantic Hierarchical Multi-label Classification called Semantic HMC based in a
non-supervised Ontology learning process. We also proposea Semantic HMC
process, using scalable Machine-Learning techniques and Rule-based reasoning.
