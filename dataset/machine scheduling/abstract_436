The activities, in project scheduling, can be represented graphically in two
different ways, by either assigning the activities to the nodes 'AoN' directed
acyclic graph (dag) or to the arcs 'AoA dag'. In this paper, a new algorithm is
proposed for generating, for a given project scheduling problem, an
Activity-on-Arc dag starting from the Activity-on-Node dag using the concepts
of line graphs of graphs.
