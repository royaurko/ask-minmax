The era of the Internet of things, machine-to-machine and human to machine
computing has heralded the development of a modern-day smart industry in which
humanoids can co-operate,co-exist and interact seamlessly.Currently, there are
many projects in this area of smart communication and thus giving rise to an
industry electrified by smart things.In this paper we present a novel smart
database management system (dbms),GOptimaEmbed, for intelligent querying of
databases in device constrained embedded systems. The system uses genetic
algorithms as main search engine and simplifies the query process using stored
in-memory model based on an invented device dependent
Short-messaging-Structured Query Language SMS SQL schema translator. In
addition, querying is done over the air using integrated GSM module in the
smart space. The system has been applied to querying a plant database and
results were quite satisfactory.
