We provide a simple proof of a computable analogue to the Jayne Rogers
Theorem from descriptive set theory. The difficulty of the proof is delegated
to a simulation result pertaining to non-deterministic type-2 machines. Thus,
we demonstrate that developments in computational models can have applications
in fields thought to be far removed from it.
