The assembly of RecA on single-stranded DNA is measured and interpreted as a
stochastic finite-state machine that is able to discriminate fine differences
between sequences, a basic computational operation. RecA filaments efficiently
scan DNA sequence through a cascade of random nucleation and disassembly events
that is mechanistically similar to the dynamic instability of microtubules.
This iterative cascade is a multistage kinetic proofreading process that
amplifies minute differences, even a single base change. Our measurements
suggest that this stochastic Turing-like machine can compute certain integral
transforms.
