We prove that every computably enumerable (c.e.) random real is provable in
Peano Arithmetic (PA) to be c.e. random. A major step in the proof is to show
that the theorem stating that "a real is c.e. and random iff it is the halting
probability of a universal prefix-free Turing machine" can be proven in PA. Our
proof, which is simpler than the standard one, can also be used for the
original theorem.
  Our positive result can be contrasted with the case of computable functions,
where not every computable function is provably computable in PA, or even more
interestingly, with the fact that almost all random finite strings are not
provably random in PA.
  We also prove two negative results: a) there exists a universal machine whose
universality cannot be proved in PA, b) there exists a universal machine $U$
such that, based on $U$, PA cannot prove the randomness of its halting
probability.
  The paper also includes a sharper form of the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem, as well
as a formal proof of this theorem written with the proof assistant Isabelle.
