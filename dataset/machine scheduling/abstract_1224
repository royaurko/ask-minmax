In this paper, we consider limited feedback systems for FDD large-scale
(massive) MIMO. A new codebook-based framework for multiuser (MU) MIMO downlink
systems is introduced and then compared with an ideal non-codebook based
system. We are particularly interested in the less-known finite-rate feedback
regime where the number $M$ of transmit antennas and the number of users are of
the same order of magnitude and $M$ is large but finite, which is a typical
scenario of large-scale MIMO. We provide new findings in this regime and
identify some benefits of the new framework in terms of scheduling gain and
downlink dedicated pilot overhead.
