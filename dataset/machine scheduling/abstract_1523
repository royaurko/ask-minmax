In this paper, we continue the efforts of the Computational Theory of
Intelligence (CTI) by extending concepts to include computational processes in
terms of Genetic Algorithms (GA's) and Turing Machines (TM's). Active, Passive,
and Hybrid Computational Intelligence processes are also introduced and
discussed. We consider the ramifications of the assumptions of CTI with regard
to the qualities of reproduction and virility. Applications to Biology,
Computer Science and Cyber Security are also discussed.
