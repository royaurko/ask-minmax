The minimization of transmission completion time for a given number of bits
per user in an energy harvesting communication system, where energy harvesting
instants are known in an offline manner is considered. An achievable rate
region with structural properties satisfied by the 2-user AWGN Broadcast
Channel capacity region is assumed. It is shown that even though all data are
available at the beginning, a non-negative amount of energy from each energy
harvest is deferred for later use such that the transmit power starts at its
lowest value and rises as time progresses. The optimal scheduler ends the
transmission to both users at the same time. Exploiting the special structure
in the problem, the iterative offline algorithm, FlowRight, from earlier
literature, is adapted and proved to solve this problem. The solution has
polynomial complexity in the number of harvests used, and is observed to
converge quickly on numerical examples.
