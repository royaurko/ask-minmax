The energy consumption issue in distributed computing systems has become
quite critical due to environmental concerns. In response to this, many
energy-aware scheduling algorithms have been developed primarily by using the
dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) capability incorporated in recent
commodity processors. The majority of these algorithms involve two passes:
schedule generation and slack reclamation. The latter is typically achieved by
lowering processor frequency for tasks with slacks. In this article, we study
the latest papers in this area and develop them. This study has been evaluated
based on results obtained from experiments with 1,500 randomly generated task
graphs.
