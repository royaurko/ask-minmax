We give small universal Turing machines with state-symbol pairs of (6, 2),
(3, 3) and (2, 4). These machines are weakly universal, which means that they
have an infinitely repeated word to the left of their input and another to the
right. They simulate Rule 110 and are currently the smallest known weakly
universal Turing machines.
