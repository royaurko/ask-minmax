Using the recently introduced universal computing model, called orchestrated
machine, that represents computations in a dissipative environment, we consider
a new kind of interpretation of Turing's Imitation Game. In addition we raise
the question whether the intelligence may show fractal properties. Then we
sketch a vision of what robotic cars are going to do in the future. Finally we
give the specification of an artificial life game based on the concept of
orchestrated machines. The purpose of this paper is to start the search for
possible relationships between these different topics.
