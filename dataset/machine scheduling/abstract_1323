The possible low-frequency radio emission from the progenitors of gamma ray
bursts can experience a delay from tens of seconds to hours on the way to the
observer due to the dispersion in galactic and extragalactic plasma, and thus
reach the observer as a radio afterglow of the burst. This opens a unique
possibility (peculiar "Time Machine") of seeing what happened in that place
before the catastrophe.
