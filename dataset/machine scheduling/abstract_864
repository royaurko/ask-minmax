We define Oracle-Type-2-Machine capable of writing infinite oracle queries.
In contrast to finite oracle queries, this extends the realm of
oracle-computable functions into the discontinuous realm. Our definition is
conservative; access to a computable oracle does not increase the computational
power.
  Other models of real hypercomputation such as Ziegler's (finitely) revising
computation or Type-2-Nondeterminism are shown to be special cases of
Oracle-Type-2-Machines. Our approach offers an intuitive definition of the
weakest machine model capable to simulate both Type-2-Machines and BSS
machines.
