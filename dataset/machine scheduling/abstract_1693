Vibration measurements have been used to reliably diagnose performance
problems in machinery and related mechanical products. A vibration data
collector can be used effectively to measure and analyze the machinery
vibration content in gearboxes, engines, turbines, fans, compressors, pumps and
bearings. Ideally, a machine will have little or no vibration, indicating that
the rotating components are appropriately balanced, aligned, and well
maintained. Quick analysis and assessment of the vibration content can lead to
fault diagnosis and prognosis of a machine's ability to continue running. The
aim of this research used vibration measurements to pinpoint mechanical defects
such as (unbalance, misalignment, resonance, and part loosening), consequently
diagnosis all necessary process for engineers and technicians who desire to
understand the vibration that exists in structures and machines.
