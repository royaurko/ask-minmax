Starting from essentially flat nanometer-thick Fe films, epitaxially grown at
room temperature on W(110) surfaces, we used carefully tuned annealing
schedules to produce periodic arrays of nanoscale ferromagnetic wires. The
structural transition from continuous films to nanowire arrays is accompanied
with an in-plane 90 degree rotation of the spontaneous magnetization. Using
spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy to map the local magnetization
directions while annealing, we studied the role of the dewetting mechanism on
the self-organization and magnetization reorientation processes.
