Optimising black-box functions is important in many disciplines, such as
tuning machine learning models, robotics, finance and mining exploration.
Bayesian optimisation is a state-of-the-art technique for the global
optimisation of black-box functions which are expensive to evaluate. At the
core of this approach is a Gaussian process prior that captures our belief
about the distribution over functions. However, in many cases a single Gaussian
process is not flexible enough to capture non-stationarity in the objective
function. Consequently, heteroscedasticity negatively affects performance of
traditional Bayesian methods. In this paper, we propose a novel prior model
with hierarchical parameter learning that tackles the problem of
non-stationarity in Bayesian optimisation. Our results demonstrate substantial
improvements in a wide range of applications, including automatic machine
learning and mining exploration.
