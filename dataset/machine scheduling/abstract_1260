Many datasets can be viewed as a noisy sampling of an underlying topological
space. Topological data analysis aims to understand and exploit this underlying
structure for the purpose of knowledge discovery. A fundamental tool of the
discipline is persistent homology, which captures underlying data-driven,
scale-dependent homological information. A representation in a "persistence
diagram" concisely summarizes this information. By giving the space of
persistence diagrams a metric structure, a class of effective machine learning
techniques can be applied. We modify the persistence diagram to a "persistence
image" in a manner that allows the use of a wider set of distance measures and
extends the list of tools from machine learning which can be utilized. It is
shown that several machine learning techniques, applied to persistence images
for classification tasks, yield high accuracy rates on multiple data sets.
Furthermore, these same machine learning techniques fare better when applied to
persistence images than when applied to persistence diagrams. We discuss
sensitivity of the classification accuracy to the parameters associated to the
approach. An application of persistence image based classification to a data
set arising from applied dynamical systems is presented to further illustrate.
