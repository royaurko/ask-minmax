The 40-year-old Fermilab Proton Source machines, constituted by the
Pre-Injector, Linac and the synchrotron Booster, have been the workhorse of the
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). During this time, the High
Energy Physics Program has demanded an increase in proton throughput,
especially during the past decade with the beginning of the neutrino program at
Fermilab. In order to achieve a successful program, major upgrades and changes
were made in Booster. Once again, the Proton Source has been charged to double
their beam throughput, while maintain the present residual activation levels,
to meet the laboratory Intensity Frontier program goals until new machines are
built and operational to replace the Proton Source machines. This paper
discusses the present performance of Booster and the plans involved in reaching
even higher intensities.
