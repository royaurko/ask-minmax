Ensuring the security of computers is a non-trivial task, with many
techniques used by malicious users to compromise these systems. In recent years
a new threat has emerged in the form of networks of hijacked zombie machines
used to perform complex distributed attacks such as denial of service and to
obtain sensitive data such as password information. These zombie machines are
said to be infected with a 'bot' - a malicious piece of software which is
installed on a host machine and is controlled by a remote attacker, termed the
'botmaster of a botnet'. In this work, we use the biologically inspired
Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) to detect the existence of a single bot on a
compromised host machine. The DCA is an immune-inspired algorithm based on an
abstract model of the behaviour of the dendritic cells of the human body. The
basis of anomaly detection performed by the DCA is facilitated using the
correlation of behavioural attributes such as keylogging and packet flooding
behaviour. The results of the application of the DCA to the detection of a
single bot show that the algorithm is a successful technique for the detection
of such malicious software without responding to normally running programs.
