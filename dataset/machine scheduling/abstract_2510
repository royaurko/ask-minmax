In 1975, Courzon and Ahlborn studied a Carnot engine with thermal losses and
got an expression for its efficiency that described better the performance of
actual heat machines than the traditional result due to Carnot. In their
original derivation, time appears explicitly and this is disappointing in the
framework of classical thermodynamics. In this note a derivation is given
without any explicit reference to time.
