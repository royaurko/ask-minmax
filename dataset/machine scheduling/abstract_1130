We study Bose-Einstein condensation phenomenon in a two-dimensional (2D)
system of bosons subjected to an harmonic oscillator type confining potential.
The interaction among the 2D bosons is described by a delta-function in
configuration space. Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation within the two-fluid
model we calculate the condensate fraction, ground state energy, and specific
heat of the system. Our results indicate that interacting bosons have similar
behavior to those of an ideal system for weak interactions.
