Appointment scheduling is a problem faced daily by many individuals and
organizations. Cooperating agent systems have been developed to partially
automate this task. In order to extend the circle of participants as far as
possible we advocate the use of natural language transmitted by e-mail. We
describe COSMA, a fully implemented German language server for existing
appointment scheduling agent systems. COSMA can cope with multiple dialogues in
parallel, and accounts for differences in dialogue behaviour between human and
machine agents. NL coverage of the sublanguage is achieved through both
corpus-based grammar development and the use of message extraction techniques.
