We exploit (co)inductive specifications and proofs to approach the evaluation
of low-level programs for the Unlimited Register Machine (URM) within the Coq
system, a proof assistant based on the Calculus of (Co)Inductive Constructions
type theory. Our formalization allows us to certify the implementation of
partial functions, thus it can be regarded as a first step towards the
development of a workbench for the formal analysis and verification of both
converging and diverging computations.
