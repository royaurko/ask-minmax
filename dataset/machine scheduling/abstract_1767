Retrieve information resources made by the machine processing may refer to
multiple sources. A personal web as part of information resources in the
Internet requires a feature that can be understood by computer machines.
Therefore, in this paper an ontology semantic web approach is used to map the
resources in a meaningful scheme. In the design of concept, resources on the
web are viewed as documents that have some property and ownership. Domain
interest or web scope is used to describe a classification of resources that
navigate into relevant documents. If instances are completed to the concept,
then the ontology file can be loaded and shared as annotation on personal web.
This allows computer machine to query multiple ontology from different personal
webs that use it.
