A number of systems in recent times suffer from attacks like DDoS and Ping of
Death. Such attacks result in loss of critical system resources and CPU cycles,
as these compromised systems behave in an abnormal manner. The effect of such
abnormalities is worse in case of compromised systems handling financial
transaction, since it leads to severe monetary losses. In this paper we propose
a system that uses the Replicated State Machine approach to detect abnormality
in system usage. The suggested system is based on PAXOS algorithm, an algorithm
for solving the consensus problem in a network of unreliable processors.
