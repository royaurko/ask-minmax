This paper presents new results concerning the observer design for wide
classes of nonlinear systems with both sampled and delayed measurements. By
using a small gain approach we provide sufficient conditions, which involve
both the delay and the sampling period, ensuring exponential convergence of the
observer system error. The proposed observer is robust with respect to
measurement errors and perturbations of the sampling schedule. Moreover, new
results on the robust global exponential state predictor design problem are
provided, for wide classes of nonlinear systems.
