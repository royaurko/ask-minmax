In this paper, analytical assessment of overlay-inband device-to-device (D2D)
communications is investigated, under cellular-network-assisted (coordinated)
scheduling. To this end, a simple scheduling scheme is assumed that takes into
account only local (per cell) topological information of the D2D links.
Stochastic geometry tools are utilized in order to obtain analytical
expressions for the interferers density as well as the D2D link
signal-to-interference-ratio distribution. The analytical results accuracy is
validated by comparison with simulations. In addition, the analytical
expressions are employed for efficiently optimizing the parameters of a
cellular system with overlay D2D communications. It is shown that coordinated
scheduling of D2D transmissions enhances system performance both in terms of
average user rate as well as maximum allowable D2D link distance.
