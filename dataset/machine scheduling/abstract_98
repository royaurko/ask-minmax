In the initial phase of the Swiss Light Source, four insertion devices will
be installed. The control system for all the ID's follows an uniform concept to
allow a rapid installation schedule, while at the same time allowing for a
variety in operational requirements. The components of the control system
include the gap drive system with encoders, temperature monitoring, beam
position monitoring, power supply controllers for corrector magnets [1] and a
timing module [2]. The gap drive system requirements range from micron-level
accuracy to driving double undulators in synchronism with each other and also
with the other beamline elements. The local synchronism is achieved with a
tightly coupled system having an intelligent motor controller and the global
synchronism by extending the machine timing distribution to the insertion
devices and the beamlines with the capability to add beamline-specific timing
events. [1] A.Luedeke et.al.,'Digital Power supplies for the Swiss Light
