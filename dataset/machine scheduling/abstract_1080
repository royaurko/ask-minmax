We show that multiple machine learning algorithms can match human performance
in classifying transient imaging data from the SDSS supernova survey into real
objects and artefacts. This is a first step in any transient science pipeline
and is currently still done by humans, but future surveys such as LSST will
necessitate fully machine-enabled solutions. Using features trained from
eigenimage analysis (PCA) of single-epoch g, r, and i-difference images we can
reach a completeness (recall) of 96%, while only incorrectly classifying at
most 18% of artefacts as real objects, corresponding to a precision (purity) of
84%. In general random forests performed best, followed by the k-nearest
neighbour and the SkyNet artificial neural net algorithms, compared to other
methods such as naive Bayes and kernel SVM. Our results show that PCA-based
machine learning can match human success levels and can naturally be extended
by including multiple epochs of data, transient colours and host galaxy
information which should allow for significant further improvements, especially
at low signal to noise.
