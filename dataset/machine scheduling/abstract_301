We consider computations of a Turing machine under noise that causes
consecutive violations of the machine's transition function. Given a constant
upper bound B on the size of bursts of faults, we construct a Turing machine
M(B) subject to faults that can simulate any fault-free machine under the
condition that bursts are not closer to each other than V for an appropriate V
= O(B^2).
