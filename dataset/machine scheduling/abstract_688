We present a methodology for the global sampled-data stabilization of systems
with a compact absorbing set and input/measurement delays. The methodology is
based on the Inter-Sample-Predictor, Observer, Predictor, Delay-Free Controller
(ISP-O-P-DFC) scheme and the stabilization is robust to perturbations of the
sampling schedule. The obtained results are novel even for the delay-free case.
