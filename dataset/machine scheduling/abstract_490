We consider an online scheduling problem, motivated by the issues present at
the joints of networks using ATM and TCP/IP. Namely, IP packets have to broken
down to small ATM cells and sent out before their deadlines, but cells
corresponding to different packets can be interwoven. More formally, we
consider the online scheduling problem with preemptions, where each job j is
revealed at release time r_j, has processing time p_j, deadline d_j and weight
w_j. A preempted job can be resumed at any time. The goal is to maximize the
total weight of all jobs completed on time. Our main result are as follows: we
prove that if all jobs have processing time exactly k, the deterministic
competitive ratio is between 2.598 and 5, and when the processing times are at
most k, the deterministic competitive ratio is Theta(k/log k).
