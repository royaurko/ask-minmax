We survey some work concerned with small universal Turing machines, cellular
automata, tag systems, and other simple models of computation. For example it
has been an open question for some time as to whether the smallest known
universal Turing machines of Minsky, Rogozhin, Baiocchi and Kudlek are
efficient (polynomial time) simulators of Turing machines. These are some of
the most intuitively simple computational devices and previously the best known
simulations were exponentially slow. We discuss recent work that shows that
these machines are indeed efficient simulators. In addition, another related
result shows that Rule 110, a well-known elementary cellular automaton, is
efficiently universal. We also discuss some old and new universal program size
results, including the smallest known universal Turing machines. We finish the
survey with results on generalised and restricted Turing machine models
including machines with a periodic background on the tape (instead of a blank
symbol), multiple tapes, multiple dimensions, and machines that never write to
their tape. We then discuss some ideas for future work.
