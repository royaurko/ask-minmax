A universal a priori semimeasure (also known as "algorithmic probability") is
defined as the transformation, by a given universal monotone Turing machine, of
the uniform measure on the infinite strings. We show in this paper that the
class of universal a priori semimeasures can equivalently be defined as the
class of transformations, by all compatible universal monotone Turing machines,
of any nonatomic computable measure in place of the uniform measure.
