Clusters, grids, and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have emerged as popular
paradigms for next generation parallel and distributed computing. The
management of resources and scheduling of applications in such large-scale
distributed systems is a complex undertaking. In order to prove the
effectiveness of resource brokers and associated scheduling algorithms, their
performance needs to be evaluated under different scenarios such as varying
number of resources and users with different requirements. In a grid
environment, it is hard and even impossible to perform scheduler performance
evaluation in a repeatable and controllable manner as resources and users are
distributed across multiple organizations with their own policies. To overcome
this limitation, we have developed a Java-based discrete-event grid simulation
toolkit called GridSim. The toolkit supports modeling and simulation of
heterogeneous grid resources (both time- and space-shared), users and
application models. It provides primitives for creation of application tasks,
mapping of tasks to resources, and their management. To demonstrate suitability
of the GridSim toolkit, we have simulated a Nimrod-G like grid resource broker
and evaluated the performance of deadline and budget constrained cost- and
time-minimization scheduling algorithms.
