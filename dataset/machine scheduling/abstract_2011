Recent performance of Fermilab's Tevatron has exceeded this year's design
goals and further accelerator upgrades are underway. The high-luminosity period
which follows these improvements is known as Run IIb. The D0 experiment is in
the midst of a comprehensive upgrade program designed to enable it to thrive
with much higher data rate and occupancy. Extensive modifications of and
additions to all levels of the trigger and the silicon tracker are in progress.
All upgrade projects are on schedule for installation in the 2005 shutdown.
