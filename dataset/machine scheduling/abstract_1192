The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors will be installed starting in
2011, with completion scheduled for 2015. The new detectors will improve the
strain sensitivity of current instruments by a factor of ten, with a
thousandfold increase in the observable volume of space. Here we describe the
design and limiting noise sources of these second generation, long-baseline,
laser interferometers.
