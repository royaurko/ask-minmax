This paper proposes a general framework for probabilistic certification of
cancer therapies. The certification is defined in terms of two key issues which
are the tumor contraction and the lower admissible bound on the circulating
lymphocytes which is viewed as indicator of the patient health. The
certification is viewed as the ability to guarantee with a predefined high
probability the success of the therapy over a finite horizon despite of the
unavoidable high uncertainties affecting the dynamic model that is used to
compute the optimal scheduling of drugs injection. The certification paradigm
can be viewed as a tool for tuning the treatment parameters and protocols as
well as for getting a rational use of limited or expensive drugs. The proposed
framework is illustrated using the specific problem of combined
immunotherapy/chemotherapy of cancer.
