NASA's Swift satellite has completed ten years of amazing discoveries in time
domain astronomy. Its primary mission is to chase gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but
due to its scheduling flexibility it has subsequently become a prime discovery
machine for new types of behavior. The list of major discoveries in GRBs and
other transients includes the long-lived X-ray afterglows and flares from GRBs,
the first accurate localization of short GRBs, the discovery of GRBs at high
redshift (z>8), supernova shock break-out from SN Ib, a jetted tidal disruption
event, an ultra-long class of GRBs, high energy emission from flare stars,
novae and supernovae with unusual characteristics, magnetars with glitches in
their spin periods, and a short GRB with evidence of an accompanying kilonova.
Swift has developed a dynamic synergism with ground based observatories. In a
few years gravitational wave observatories will come on-line and provide
exciting new transient sources for Swift to study.
