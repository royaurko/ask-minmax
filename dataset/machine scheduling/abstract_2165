We propose a novel approach to utilize low-cadence photometric surveys for
exoplanetary transit search. Even if transits are undetectable in the survey
database alone, it can still be useful for finding preferred times for directed
follow-up observations that will maximize the chances to detect transits. We
demonstrate the approach through a few simulated cases. These simulations are
based on the Hipparcos Epoch Photometry data base, and the transiting planets
whose transits were already detected there. In principle, the approach we
propose will be suitable for the directed follow-up of the photometry from the
planned Gaia mission, and it can hopefully significantly increase the yield of
exoplanetary transits detected, thanks to Gaia.
