Virtual machine (VM) placement is very important for cloud platforms. While
techniques, such as live virtual machine migration, are very useful to balance
the load in the data centers, they are expensive operations. In this position
paper, we propose to minimize the chance of the load hot spots in the data
center by applying the workload patterns of the VMs in the virtual machine
placement algorithms - place VMs that require a lot of same type of resource
across different physical servers. In this way, the resource competition of VMs
on the same physical server is significantly mitigated. Meanwhile, we also
consider the priorities of applications and VMs in our virtual machine
placement algorithms.
