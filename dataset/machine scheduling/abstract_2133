The Diffuse X-rays from the Local galaxy (DXL) mission is an approved
sounding rocket project with a first launch scheduled around December 2012. Its
goal is to identify and separate the X-ray emission generated by solar wind
charge exchange from that of the local hot bubble to improve our understanding
of both. With 1,000 cm2 proportional counters and grasp of about 10 cm2 sr both
in the 1/4 and 3/4 keV bands, DXL will achieve in a 5-minute flight what cannot
be achieved by current and future X-ray satellites.
