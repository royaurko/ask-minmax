In many areas of machine learning, it becomes necessary to find the
eigenvector decompositions of large matrices. We discuss two methods for
reducing the computational burden of spectral decompositions: the more
venerable Nystom extension and a newly introduced algorithm based on random
projections. Previous work has centered on the ability to reconstruct the
original matrix. We argue that a more interesting and relevant comparison is
their relative performance in clustering and classification tasks using the
approximate eigenvectors as features. We demonstrate that performance is task
specific and depends on the rank of the approximation.
