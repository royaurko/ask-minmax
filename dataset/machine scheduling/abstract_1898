Properties of normal galactic star formation, including the density
dependence, threshold density, turbulent scaling relations, and clustering
properties, are applied to the formation of galactic bulges. One important
difference is that the bulge potential well is too deep to have allowed
self-regulation or blow-out by the pressures from young stars, unlike galactic
disks or dwarf galaxies. As a result, bulge formation should have been at the
maximum rate, which is such that most of the gas would get converted into stars
in only a few dynamical time scales, or ~10^8 years. The gas accretion phase
can be longer than this, but once the critical density is reached, which
depends primarily on the total virial density from dark matter, the formation
of stars in the bulge should have been extremely rapid. Such three-dimensional
star formation should also have formed many clusters, like normal disk star
formation today. Some of these clusters may have survived as old globulars, but
most got dispersed, although they might still be observable as concentrated
streams in phase space.
