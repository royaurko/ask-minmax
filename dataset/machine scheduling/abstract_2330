Motivated by damage due to heating in sensor operation, we consider the
throughput optimal offline data scheduling problem in an energy harvesting
transmitter such that the resulting temperature increase remains below a
critical level. We model the temperature dynamics of the transmitter as a
linear system and determine the optimal transmit power policy under such
temperature constraints as well as energy harvesting constraints over an AWGN
channel. We first derive the structural properties of the solution for the
general case with multiple energy arrivals. We show that the optimal power
policy is piecewise monotone decreasing with possible jumps at the energy
harvesting instants. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal solution
in the single energy arrival case. We show that, in the single energy arrival
case, the optimal power is monotone decreasing, the resulting temperature is
monotone increasing, and both remain constant after the temperature hits the
critical level. We then generalize the solution for the multiple energy arrival
case.
