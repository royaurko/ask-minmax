We are studying the electron scattering process e p to e' p' gamma in order
to obtain information on the genuine virtual Compton scattering (VCS) process
gamma^* N to gamma N. In addition to the two kinematical variables of real
Compton scattering, e.g. the scattering angle theta and the energy omega' of
the outgoing photon, the invariant amplitude for VCS depends on a third
kinematical variable, which we choose as the absolute value of the
three-momentum transfer to the nucleon. The structure-dependent coefficients in
the VCS amplitude therefore acquire a momentum dependence and are termed
``generalized polarizabilities'' of the nucleon in analogy to real Compton
scattering. Utilizing the heavy baryon formalism of chiral perturbation theory
we present predictions for the momentum dependence of the ``generalized
polarizabilities'' and discuss the VCS response functions to be measured in the
scheduled electron scattering experiments.
