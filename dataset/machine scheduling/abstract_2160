This review focuses on nuclear reactions in astrophysics and, more
specifically, on reactions with light ions (nucleons and alpha particles)
proceeding via the strong interaction. It is intended to present the basic
definitions essential for studies in nuclear astrophysics, to point out the
differences between nuclear reactions taking place in stars and in a
terrestrial laboratory, and to illustrate some of the challenges to be faced in
theoretical and experimental studies of those reactions. The discussion
revolves around the relevant quantities for astrophysics, which are the
astrophysical reaction rates. The sensitivity of the reaction rates to the
uncertainties in the prediction of various nuclear properties is explored and
some guidelines for experimentalists are also provided.
