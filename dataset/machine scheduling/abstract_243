Scheduling is the central concept used frequently in Operating System. It
helps in choosing the processes for execution. Round Robin (RR) is one of the
most widely used CPU scheduling algorithm. But, its performance degrades with
respect to context switching, which is an overhead and it occurs during each
scheduling. Overall performance of the system depends on choice of an optimal
time quantum, so that context switching can be reduced. In this paper, we have
proposed a new variant of RR scheduling algorithm, known as Dynamic Quantum
with Readjusted Round Robin (DQRRR) algorithm. We have experimentally shown
that performance of DQRRR is better than RR by reducing number of context
switching, average waiting time and average turn around time.
