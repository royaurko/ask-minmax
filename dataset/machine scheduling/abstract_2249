We investigate the outflux of ions through the channels in a cell membrane.
The channels undergo an open/close cycle according to a periodic schedule. Our
study is based both on theoretical considerations relying on homogenization
theory, and on Monte Carlo numerical simulations. We examine the onset of a
limiting boundary behavior characterized by a constant ratio between the
outflux and the local density, in the thermodynamics limit. The focus here is
on the issue of selectivity, that is on the different behavior of the ion
currents through the channel in the cases of the selected and non-selected
species.
