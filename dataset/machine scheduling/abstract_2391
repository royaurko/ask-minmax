Industrial high speed laser operations the use of delta parallel robots
potentially offers many benefits due to their structural stiffness and limited
moving masses. This paper deals with a particular Delta, developed for high
speed laser cutting. Parallel delta robot has numerous advantages in comparison
with serial robots Higher stiffness and connected with that a lower mass of
links the possibility of transporting heavier loads, and higher accuracy. The
main drawback is however a smaller workspace. Hence there exists an interest
for the research concerning the workspace of robots.In industrial cutting tool
maximum do not have more prescribe measurement to cut so that in This paper is
oriented to parallel kinematic robots definition description of their specific
application of laser cutting comparison of robots made by different producers
and determination of velocity and acceleration parameters kinematic analysis
inverse and forward kinematic. It brings information about development of Delta
robot. The production of laser cutting machines began thirty years ago. The
progress was very fast and at present time every year over 3000 laser cutting
machines is installed in the world. Laser cutting is one of the largest
applications of lasers in metal working industry.
