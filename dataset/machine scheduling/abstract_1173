A fundamental problem in distributed computing is the task of cooperatively
executing a given set of $t$ tasks by $p$ processors where the communication
medium is dynamic and subject to failures. The dynamics of the communication
medium lead to groups of processors being disconnected and possibly reconnected
during the entire course of the computation furthermore tasks can have
dependencies among them. In this paper, we present a randomized algorithm whose
competitive ratio is dependent on the dynamics of the communication medium and
also on the nature of the dependencies among the tasks.
