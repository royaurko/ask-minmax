Determinantal point process have recently been used as models in machine
learning and this has raised questions regarding the characterizations of
conditional independence. In this paper we investigate characterizations of
conditional independence. We describe some conditional independencies through
the conditions on the kernel of a determinantal point process, and show many
can be obtained using the graph induced by a kernel of the $L$-ensemble.
