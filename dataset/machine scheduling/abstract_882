We review recent work on wormhole geometries in the context of modified
theories of gravity, in particular, in f(R) gravity and with a nonminimal
curvature-matter coupling, and in the recently proposed hybrid metric-Palatini
theory. In principle, the normal matter threading the throat can be shown to
satisfy the energy conditions and it is the higher order curvatures terms that
sustain these wormhole geometries. We also briefly review the conversion of
wormholes into time-machines, explore several of the time travel paradoxes and
possible remedies to these intriguing side-effects in wormhole physics.
