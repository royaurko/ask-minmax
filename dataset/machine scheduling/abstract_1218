Custom memory organization are challenging task in the area of VLSI design.
This study aims to design high speed and low power consumption memory for
embedded system. Synchronous SRAM has been proposed and analyzed using various
simulators. Xilinx simulator simulates the Synchronous SRAM memories which can
perform efficient read/write capability for embedded systems. Xinix tool also
provide the access time that required selecting a word and reading it.
Synchronous Static RAM which has easily read /writes capability and performs
scheduled read /writes operation in efficient manner.
