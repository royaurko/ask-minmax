Current approaches in pulse detection use domain transformations so as to
concentrate frequency related information that can be distinguishable from
noise. In real cases we do not know when the pulse will begin, so we need a
time search process in which time windows are scheduled and analysed. Each
window can contain the pulsed signal (either complete or incomplete) and / or
noise. In this paper a simple search process will be introduced, allowing the
algorithm to process more information, upgrading the capabilities in terms of
probability of detection (Pd) and probability of false alarm (Pfa).
