This work studies some aspects of the computational power of fully
asynchronous cellular automata (ACA). We deal with some notions of simulation
between ACA and Turing Machines. In particular, we characterize the updating
sequences specifying which are "universal", i.e., allowing a (specific family
of) ACA to simulate any TM on any input. We also consider the computational
cost of such simulations.
