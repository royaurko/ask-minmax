Telescope networks are gaining traction due to their promise of higher
resource utilization than single telescopes and as enablers of novel
astronomical observation modes. However, as telescope network sizes increase,
the possibility of scheduling them completely or even semi-manually disappears.
In an earlier paper, a step towards software telescope scheduling was made with
the specification of the Reservation formalism, through the use of which
astronomers can express their complex observation needs and preferences. In
this paper we build on that work. We present a solution to the discretized
version of the problem of scheduling a telescope network. We derive a solvable
integer linear programming (ILP) model based on the Reservation formalism. We
show computational results verifying its correctness, and confirm that our
Gurobi-based implementation can address problems of realistic size. Finally, we
extend the ILP model to also handle the novel observation requests that can be
specified using the more advanced Compound Reservation formalism.
