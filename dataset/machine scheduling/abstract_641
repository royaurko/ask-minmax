The nature of clinical data makes it difficult to quickly select, tune and
apply machine learning algorithms to clinical prognosis. As a result, a lot of
time is spent searching for the most appropriate machine learning algorithms
applicable in clinical prognosis that contains either binary-valued or
multi-valued attributes. The study set out to identify and evaluate the
performance of machine learning classification schemes applied in clinical
prognosis of post-operative life expectancy in the lung cancer patients.
Multilayer Perceptron, J48, and the Naive Bayes algorithms were used to train
and test models on Thoracic Surgery datasets obtained from the University of
California Irvine machine learning repository. Stratified 10-fold
cross-validation was used to evaluate baseline performance accuracy of the
classifiers. The comparative analysis shows that multilayer perceptron
performed best with classification accuracy of 82.3%, J48 came out second with
classification accuracy of 81.8%, and Naive Bayes came out the worst with
classification accuracy of 74.4%. The quality and outcome of the chosen machine
learning algorithms depends on the ingenuity of the clinical miner.
