This paper introduces a combined approach for the recovery of a timetable by
rescheduling trips and vehicle circulations for a rail-based transportation
system subject to disruptions. We propose a novel event-based integer
programming (IP) model. Features include shifting and canceling of trips as
well as modifying the vehicle schedules by changing or truncating the
circulations. The objective maximizes the number of recovered trips, possibly
with delay, while guaranteeing a conflict-free new timetable for the estimated
time window of the disruption. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach
through experiments for real-life test instances of relevant size, arising from
the subway system of Vienna. We focus on scenarios in which one direction of
one track is blocked, and trains have to be scheduled through this bottleneck.
Solving these instances is made possible by contracting parts of the underlying
event-activity graph; this allows a significant size reduction of the IP.
Usually, the solutions found within one minute are of good quality and can be
used as good estimates of recovery plans in an online context.
