We consider the downlink of a cellular network with multiple cells and
multi-antenna base stations, including a realistic distance-dependent pathloss
model, clusters of cooperating cells, and general "fairness" requirements.
Beyond Monte Carlo simulation, no efficient computation method to evaluate the
ergodic throughput of such systems has been presented so far. We propose an
analytic solution based on the combination of large random matrix results and
convex optimization. The proposed method is computationally much more efficient
than Monte Carlo simulation and provides surprisingly accurate approximations
for the actual finite-dimensional systems, even for a small number of users and
base station antennas. Numerical examples include 2-cell linear and
three-sectored 7-cell planar layouts, with no inter-cell cooperation, sector
cooperation, or full inter-cell cooperation.
