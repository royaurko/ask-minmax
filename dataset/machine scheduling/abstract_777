We generalize several schedule matching theorems of Baiou-Balinski (Math.
Oper. Res., 27 (2002), 485) and Alkan-Gale (J. Econ. Th. 112 (2003), 289) by
applying a fixed point method of Fleiner (Math. Oper. Res., 28 (2003), 103).
Thanks to a more general construction of revealing choice maps we develop an
algorithm to solve rather complex matching problems. The flexibility and
efficiency of our approach is illustrated by various examples. We also revisit
the mathematical structure of the matching theory by comparing various
definitions of stable sets and various classes of choice maps. We demonstrate,
by several examples, that the revealing property of the choice maps is the most
suitable one to ensure the existence of stable matchings; both from the
theoretical and the practical point of view.
