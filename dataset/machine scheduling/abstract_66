We consider a strategic game, where players submit jobs to a machine that
executes all jobs in a way that minimizes energy while respecting the given
eadlines. The energy consumption is then charged to the players in some way.
Each player wants to minimize the sum of that charge and of their job's
deadline ultiplied by a priority weight. Two charging schemes are studied, the
proportional cost share which does not always admit pure Nash equilibria, and
the arginal cost share, which does always admit pure Nash equilibria, at the
price of overcharging by a constant factor.
