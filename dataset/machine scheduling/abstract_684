Hans Duistermaat was scheduled to lecture in the 2010 School on Poisson
Geometry at IMPA, but passed away suddenly. This is a record of a talk I gave
at the 2010 Conference on Poisson Geometry (the week after the School) to share
some of my memories of him and to give a brief assessment of his impact on the
subject.
