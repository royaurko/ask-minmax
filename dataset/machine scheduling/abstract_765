Many SOCs today contain both digital and analog embedded cores. Even though
the test cost for such mixed-signal SOCs is significantly higher than that for
digital SOCs, most prior research in this area has focused exclusively on
digital cores. We propose a low-cost test development methodology for
mixed-signal SOCs that allows the analog and digital cores to be tested in a
unified manner, thereby minimizing the overall test cost. The analog cores in
the SOC are wrapped such that they can be accessed using a digital test access
mechanism (TAM). We evaluate the impact of the use of analog test wrappers on
area overhead and test time. To reduce area overhead, we present an analog test
wrapper optimization technique, which is then combined with TAM optimization in
a cost-oriented heuristic approach for test scheduling. We also demonstrate the
feasibility of using analog wrappers by presenting transistor-level simulations
for an analog wrapper and a representative core. We present experimental
results on test scheduling for an ITC'02 benchmark SOC that has been augmented
with five analog cores.
