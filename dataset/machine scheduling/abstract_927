Quantum heat machines (QHMs) models generally assume a weak coupling to the
baths. This supposition is grounded in the separability principle between
systems and allows the derivation of the evolution equation for this case. In
the weak coupling regime, the machine's output is limited by the coupling
strength, restricting their application. Seeking to overcome this limitation,
we here analyze QHMs in the virtually unexplored strong coupling regime, where
separability, as well as other standard thermodynamic assumptions, may no
longer hold. We show that strongly coupled QHMs may be as efficient as their
weakly coupled counterparts. In addition, we find a novel turnover behavior
where their output saturates and disappears in the limit of ultra-strong
coupling.
