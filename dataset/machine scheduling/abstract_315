Computational Grids, coupling geographically distributed resources such as
PCs, workstations, clusters, and scientific instruments, have emerged as a next
generation computing platform for solving large-scale problems in science,
engineering, and commerce. However, application development, resource
management, and scheduling in these environments continue to be a complex
undertaking. In this article, we discuss our efforts in developing a resource
management system for scheduling computations on resources distributed across
the world with varying quality of service. Our service-oriented grid computing
system called Nimrod-G manages all operations associated with remote execution
including resource discovery, trading, scheduling based on economic principles
and a user defined quality of service requirement. The Nimrod-G resource broker
is implemented by leveraging existing technologies such as Globus, and provides
new services that are essential for constructing industrial-strength Grids. We
discuss results of preliminary experiments on scheduling some parametric
computations using the Nimrod-G resource broker on a world-wide grid testbed
that spans five continents.
