During the products design, the design office defines dimensional and
geometrical parameters according to the use criteria and the product
functionality. The manufacturing department must integrate the manufacturing
and the workpiece position dispersions during the choice of tools and machines
operating modes and parameters values to respect the functional constraints. In
this paper, we suggest to model the turning dispersions taking into account not
only geometrical specifications of position or orientation but also the
experience of method actors. A representation using the principle of know-how
maps in two or three dimensions is privileged. The most interesting aspect is
that these maps include tacit and explicit knowledge. An experimental study
realized on a machine tool (HES 300) allows to elaborate knowledge maps
especially for the turning process.
