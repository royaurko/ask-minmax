This paper describes the workspace and the inverse and direct kinematic
analysis of the VERNE machine, a serial/parallel 5-axis machine tool designed
by Fatronik for IRCCyN. This machine is composed of a three-degree-of-freedom
(DOF) parallel module and a two-DOF serial tilting table. The parallel module
consists of a moving platform that is connected to a fixed base by three
non-identical legs. This feature involves (i) a simultaneous combination of
rotation and translation for the moving platform, which is balanced by the
tilting table and (ii) workspace whose shape and volume vary as a function of
the tool length. This paper summarizes results obtained in the context of the
European projects NEXT ("Next Generation of Productions Systems").
