Given a hierarchical plan (or schedule) with uncertain task times, we may
need to determine the probability that a given plan will satisfy a given
deadline. This problem is shown to be NP-hard for series-parallel hierarchies.
We provide a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for it. Computing the
expected makespan of an hierarchical plan is also shown to be NP-hard. We
examine the approximation bounds empirically and demonstrate where our scheme
is superior to sampling and to exact computation.
