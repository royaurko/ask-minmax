We have observed the Galactic supernova remnant G16.7+0.1 for 13 ks using the
EPIC cameras aboard the XMM-Newton X-ray Observatory, producing the first X-ray
image of the remnant. This composite radio remnant has a core radio flux
density of only 100 mJy, making it one of the faintest radio synchrotron
nebulae yet detected, although the core-to-shell flux ratio at 6 cm is typical
of the growing class of composite remnants. Our image is seriously contaminated
by bright arcs produced by singly reflected X-rays from the X-ray binary GX17+2
which lies just outside the field of view, providing an interesting data
analysis challenge. Nonetheless, the remnant's synchrotron core is clearly
detected. We report on the spectrum and intensity of the core emission as well
as on our search for emission from the thermal shell, and describe the
constraints these observations provide on the remnant's distance, age, and
central pulsar properties.
