This paper explores and clarifies several issues surrounding Zeno machines
and the issue of running a Turing machine for infinite time. Without a minimum
hypothetical bound on physical conditions, any magical machine can be created,
and therefore, a thesis on the bound is formulated. This paper then proves that
the halting problem algorithm for every Turing-recognizable program and every
input cannot be devised whatever method is used to exploit infinite
running-time of Turing machine.
