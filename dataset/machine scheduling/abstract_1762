This thesis expands upon an existing system called Golondrina that performs
autonomic workload management among a cluster of hardware nodes running
operating system-level virtualization. Golondrina works by identifying
localized resource stress situations and attempting to dissipate them by
reallocating system resources and, if necessary, migrating or replicating
virtual machines. It is predicted that, using Golondrina, efficiency of similar
systems can be further improved by achieving greater resource utilization on
the hardware nodes while maintaining resource availability for each virtual
machine.
  The following topics are discussed: virtualization technologies and
associated challenges relating to resource management, the architecture and
design of Golondrina, intelligent resource reallocation based on predefined
policies, and preliminary results demonstrating the effects of a memory
resource management policy on the performance of a web application hosted in a
virtual environment.
  This research makes a significant contribution to the study of virtualized
data centres since currently no other system considers virtual machine
replication and dynamic memory reallocation as an approach to workload
management.
