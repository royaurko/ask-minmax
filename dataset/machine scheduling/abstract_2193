This work considers communication over Gaussian interference channels with
processing energy cost, which explicitly takes into account the energy expended
for processing when transmitters are on. In the presence of processing energy
cost, transmitting all the time as in the conventional no-cost case is no
longer optimal. For a two-user Gaussian interference channel with processing
energy cost, assuming that the on-off states of transmitters are not utilized
for signaling, several transmission schemes with varying complexities are
proposed and their sum rates are compared with an interference-free upper
bound. Moreover, the very strong interference regime, under which interference
does not incur any rate penalty, is identified and shown to be larger than the
case of no processing energy cost for certain scenarios of interest. Also,
extensions to a three-user cascade Gaussian Z interference channel with
processing energy cost are provided, where scheduling of user transmissions
based on the channel set-up is investigated.
