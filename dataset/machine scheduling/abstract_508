An ab-initio numerical study of the density-dependent, evolutionary stable
dispersal strategy is presented. The simulations are based on a simple
discretei generation island model with four processes: reproduction, dispersal,
competition and local catastrophe. We do not impose any a priori constraints on
the dispersal schedule, allowing the entire schedule to evolve. We find that
the system converges at long times to a unique nontrivial dispersal schedule
such that the dispersal probability is a monotonically increasing function of
the density. We have explored the dependence of the selected dispersal strategy
on the various system parameters: mean number of offspring, site carrying
capacity, dispersal cost and system size. A few general scaling laws are seen
to emerge from the data.
