This paper gives an introduction to the layout of the CLIC Machine Detector
Interface as it has been defined for the CLIC Conceptual Design Report. We
concentrate on the specific case of the CLIC_SiD detector, although the
push-pull concept for two detectors has been included in the design. Some
recent work and developments are described as well. However, for the details we
refer to the detailed technical talks at this conference.
