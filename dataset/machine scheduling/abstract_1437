Luminosity spectrum and accelerator background levels strongly influence the
experimental conditions and have an important impact on detector design. The
expected rates of the main beam-beam products at CLIC 3 TeV CM energy, taking
into account for machine imperfections, are computed. Among the other
machine-induced background the photon fans from the Incoherent Synchrotron
Radiation (ISR) photons emitted in the final doublet are evaluated.
