Tool condition monitoring (TCM) systems can improve productivity and ensure
workpiece quality, yet, there is a lack of reliable TCM solutions for
small-batch or one-off manufacturing of industrial parts. TCM methods which
include the characteristics of the cut seem to be particularly suitable for
these demanding applications. In the first section of this paper, three
process-based indicators have been retrieved from literature dealing with TCM.
They are analysed using a cutting force model and experiments are carried out
in industrial conditions. Specific transient cuttings encountered during the
machining of the test part reveal the indicators to be unreliable.
Consequently, in the second section, a versatile in-process monitoring method
is suggested. Based on experiments carried out under a range of different
cutting conditions, an adequate indicator is proposed: the relative radial
eccentricity of the cutters is estimated at each instant and characterizes the
tool state. It is then compared with the previous tool state in order to detect
cutter breakage or chipping. Lastly, the new approach is shown to be reliable
when implemented during the machining of the test part.
