The explosive increase in data demand coupled with the rapid deployment of
various wireless access technologies have led to the increase of number of
multi-homed or multi-interface enabled devices. Fully exploiting these
interfaces has motivated researchers to propose numerous solutions that
aggregate their available bandwidths to increase overall throughput and satisfy
the end-user's growing data demand. These solutions, however, have faced a
steep deployment barrier that we attempt to overcome in this paper. We propose
a Deployable Bandwidth Aggregation System (DBAS) for multi-interface enabled
devices. Our system does not introduce any intermediate hardware, modify
current operating systems, modify socket implementations, nor require changes
to current applications or legacy servers. The DBAS architecture is designed to
automatically estimate the characteristics of applications and dynamically
schedule various connections or packets to different interfaces. Since our main
focus is deployability, we fully implement DBAS on the Windows operating system
and evaluate various modes of operation. Our implementation and simulation
results show that DBAS achieves throughput gains up to 193% compared to current
operating systems, while operating as an out-of-the-box standard Windows
executable, highlighting its deployability and ease of use.
