This paper proposes a fully distributed Demand-Side Management system for
Smart Grid infrastructures, especially tailored to reduce the peak demand of
residential users. In particular, we use a dynamic pricing strategy, where
energy tariffs are function of the overall power demand of customers. We
consider two practical cases: (1) a fully distributed approach, where each
appliance decides autonomously its own scheduling, and (2) a hybrid approach,
where each user must schedule all his appliances. We analyze numerically these
two approaches, showing that they are characterized practically by the same
performance level in all the considered grid scenarios. We model the proposed
system using a non-cooperative game theoretical approach, and demonstrate that
our game is a generalized ordinal potential one under general conditions.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective best response strategy that is
proved to converge in a few steps to a pure Nash Equilibrium, thus
demonstrating the robustness of the power scheduling plan obtained without any
central coordination of the operator or the customers. Numerical results,
obtained using real load profiles and appliance models, show that the
system-wide peak absorption achieved in a completely distributed fashion can be
reduced up to 55%, thus decreasing the capital expenditure (CAPEX) necessary to
meet the growing energy demand.
