Predictive maintenance is directed towards recognizing the earliest
significant changes in machinery condition. Contrasted with protective
condition monitoring in which fast response is the primary requirement,
predictive monitoring is not limited by time and may use a greather range of
complex characteristics. Vibration analysis has long been used for the
detection and identification of machine tool condition. Main focus is to
identify a procedure to obtain eigenvalue frequencies for machine tool spindle
using tracking analysis.
