We describe an adaptation of the simulated annealing algorithm to
nonparametric clustering and related probabilistic models. This new algorithm
learns nonparametric latent structure over a growing and constantly churning
subsample of training data, where the portion of data subsampled can be
interpreted as the inverse temperature beta(t) in an annealing schedule. Gibbs
sampling at high temperature (i.e., with a very small subsample) can more
quickly explore sketches of the final latent state by (a) making longer jumps
around latent space (as in block Gibbs) and (b) lowering energy barriers (as in
simulated annealing). We prove subsample annealing speeds up mixing time N^2 ->
N in a simple clustering model and exp(N) -> N in another class of models,
where N is data size. Empirically subsample-annealing outperforms naive Gibbs
sampling in accuracy-per-wallclock time, and can scale to larger datasets and
deeper hierarchical models. We demonstrate improved inference on million-row
subsamples of US Census data and network log data and a 307-row hospital rating
dataset, using a Pitman-Yor generalization of the Cross Categorization model.
