We summarize methods and plans to monitor and calibrate photometric
observations with our autonomous, robotic network of 2m, 1m and 40cm
telescopes. These are sited globally to optimize our ability to observe
time-variable sources. Wide field "context" cameras are aligned with our
network telescopes and cycle every 2 minutes through BVriz filters, spanning
our optical range. We measure instantaneous zero-point offsets and transparency
(throughput) against calibrators in the 5-12m range from the all-sky Tycho2
catalog, and periodically against primary standards. Similar measurements are
made for all our science images, with typical fields of view of 0.5 degrees.
These are matched against Landolt, Stetson and Sloan standards, and against
calibrators in the 10-17m range from the all-sky APASS catalog. Such
measurements provide pretty good instantaneous flux calibration, often to
better than 5%, even in cloudy conditions. Zero-point and transparency
measurements can be used to characterize, monitor and inter-compare sites and
equipment. When accurate calibrations of Target against Standard fields are
required, monitoring measurements can be used to select truly photometric
periods when accurate calibrations can be automatically scheduled and
performed.
