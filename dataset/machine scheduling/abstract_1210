In Artificial Intelligence, planning refers to an area of research that
proposes to develop systems that can automatically generate a result set, in
the form of an integrated decision-making system through a formal procedure,
known as plan. Instead of resorting to the scheduling algorithms to generate
plans, it is proposed to operate the automatic learning by decision tree to
optimize time. In this paper, we propose to build a classification model by
induction graph from a learning sample containing plans that have an associated
set of descriptors whose values change depending on each plan. This model will
then operate for classifying new cases by assigning the appropriate plan.
