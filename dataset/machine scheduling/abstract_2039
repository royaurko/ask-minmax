Observations of a doubly driven V system probed to a fourth level in an N
configuration are reported. A dressed state analysis is also presented. The
expected three-peak spectrum is explored in a cold rubidium sample in a
magneto-optic trap. Good agreement is found between the dressed state theory
and the experimental spectra once light shifts and uncoupled absorptions in the
rubidium system are taken into account.
