We propose ARock, an asynchronous parallel algorithmic framework for finding
a fixed point to a nonexpansive operator. In the framework, a set of agents
(machines, processors, or cores) update a sequence of randomly selected
coordinates of the unknown variable in an asynchronous parallel fashion. As
special cases of ARock, novel algorithms for linear systems, convex
optimization, machine learning, distributed and decentralized optimization are
introduced.
  We show that if the operator has a fixed point and is nonexpansive, then with
probability one, the sequence of points generated by ARock converges to a fixed
point. Stronger convergence properties such as linear convergence are obtained
under stronger conditions. Very promising numerical performance of ARock has
been observed. Considering the paper length, we present the numerical results
of solving linear equations and sparse logistic regression problems.
