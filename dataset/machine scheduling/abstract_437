Parallel tempering is a generic Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method
which allows good mixing with multimodal target distributions, where
conventional Metropolis-Hastings algorithms often fail. The mixing properties
of the sampler depend strongly on the choice of tuning parameters, such as the
temperature schedule and the proposal distribution used for local exploration.
We propose an adaptive algorithm which tunes both the temperature schedule and
the parameters of the random-walk Metropolis kernel automatically. We prove the
convergence of the adaptation and a strong law of large numbers for the
algorithm. We illustrate the performance of our method with examples. Our
empirical findings indicate that the algorithm can cope well with different
kind of scenarios without prior tuning.
