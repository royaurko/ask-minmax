We have measured dielectric properties of Ca$_{1+x}$Cu$_{3-x}$Ti$_4$O$_{12}$
($x$ = 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.9 and 3), and have found that
Ca$_2$Cu$_2$Ti$_4$O$_{12}$ (a composite of CaCu$_3$Ti$_4$O$_{12}$ and
CaTiO$_3$) exhibits a high dielectric constant of 1800 with a low dissipation
factor of 0.02 below 100 kHz from 220 to 300 K. These are comparable to (or
even better than) those of the Pb/Ba-based ceramics, which could be attributed
to a barrier layer of CaTiO$_3$ on the surface of the CaCu$_3$Ti$_4$O$_{12}$
grains. The composite dielectric ceramics reported here are environmentally
benign as they do not contain Ba/Pb.
