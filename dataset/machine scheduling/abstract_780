In this paper I have study to Reduce the time Complexity of Earliest Deadline
First (EDF), a global scheduling scheme for Earliest Deadline First in Real
Time System tasks on a Multiprocessors system. Several admission control
algorithms for Earliest Deadline First (EDF) are presented, both for hard and
soft real-time tasks. The average performance of these admission control
algorithms is compared with the performance of known partitioning schemes. I
have applied some modification to the global Earliest Deadline First (EDF)
algorithms to decrease the number of task migration and also to add
predictability to its behavior. The Aim of this work is to provide a
sensitivity analysis for task deadline context of multiprocessor system by
using a new approach of EFDF (Earliest Feasible Deadline First) algorithm. In
order to decrease the number of migrations we prevent a job from moving one
processor to another processor if it is among the m higher priority jobs.
Therefore, a job will continue its execution on the same processor if possible
(processor affinity). The result of these comparisons outlines some situations
where one scheme is preferable over the other. Partitioning schemes are better
suited for hard real-time systems, while a global scheme is preferable for soft
real-time systems.
