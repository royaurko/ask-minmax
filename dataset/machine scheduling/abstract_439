In this paper, we have proposed a new variant of Round Robin scheduling
algorithm by executing the processes according to the new calculated Fit Factor
f and using the concept of dynamic time quantum. We have compared the
performance of our proposed Fittest Job First Dynamic Round Robin(FJFDRR)
algorithm with the Priority Based Static Round Robin(PBSRR) algorithm.
Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than
PBSRR in terms of reducing the number of context switches, average waiting time
and average turnaround time.
