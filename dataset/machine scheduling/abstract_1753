Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems are powerful search tools in
image databases that have been little applied to hyperspectral images.
Relevance feedback (RF) is an iterative process that uses machine learning
techniques and user's feedback to improve the CBIR systems performance. We
pursued to expand previous research in hyperspectral CBIR systems built on
dissimilarity functions defined either on spectral and spatial features
extracted by spectral unmixing techniques, or on dictionaries extracted by
dictionary-based compressors. These dissimilarity functions were not suitable
for direct application in common machine learning techniques. We propose to use
a RF general approach based on dissimilarity spaces which is more appropriate
for the application of machine learning algorithms to the hyperspectral
RF-CBIR. We validate the proposed RF method for hyperspectral CBIR systems over
a real hyperspectral dataset.
