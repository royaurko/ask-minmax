Individual pulses from pulsars have intensity-phase profiles that differ
widely from pulse to pulse, from the average profile, and from phase to phase
within a pulse. Widely accepted explanations for pulsar radio emission and its
time variability do not exist. Here, by analysing data near the peak of the
Vela pulsar's average profile, we show that Vela's variability corresponds to
lognormal field statistics, consistent with the prediction of stochastic growth
theory (SGT) for a purely linear system close to marginal stability. Vela's
variability is therefore a direct manifestation of an SGT state and the field
statistics constrain the emission mechanism to be linear (either direct or
indirect), ruling out nonlinear mechanisms like wave collapse. Field statistics
are thus a powerful, potentially widely applicable tool for understanding
variability and constraining mechanisms and source characteristics of coherent
astrophysical and space emissions.
