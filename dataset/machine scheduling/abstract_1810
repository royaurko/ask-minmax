Building machine translation (MT) test sets is a relatively expensive task.
As MT becomes increasingly desired for more and more language pairs and more
and more domains, it becomes necessary to build test sets for each case. In
this paper, we investigate using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to make MT
test sets cheaply. We find that MTurk can be used to make test sets much
cheaper than professionally-produced test sets. More importantly, in
experiments with multiple MT systems, we find that the MTurk-produced test sets
yield essentially the same conclusions regarding system performance as the
professionally-produced test sets yield.
