We present a practical and provably-secure multimode communication scheme in
the presence of a passive eavesdropper. The scheme is based on a random
scheduling approach that hides the identity of the transmitter from the
eavesdropper. This random scheduling leads to ambiguity at the eavesdropper
with regard to the origin of the transmitted frame. We present the details of
the technique and analyze it to quantify the secrecy-fairness-overhead
trade-off. Implementation of the scheme over Crossbow Telosb motes, equipped
with CC2420 radio chips, shows that the scheme can achieve significant secrecy
gain with vanishing outage probability. In addition, it has significant
overhead advantage over direct extensions to two-nodes schemes. The technique
also has the advantage of allowing inactive nodes to leverage sleep mode to
further save energy.
