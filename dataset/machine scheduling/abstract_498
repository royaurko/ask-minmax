We study the so-called the traveling tournament problem (TTP), to find an
optimal tournament schedule. Differently from the original TTP, in which the
total travel distance of all the participants is the objective function to
minimize, we instead seek to maximize the fairness of the round robin
tournament schedule of the Korean Baseball League. The standard deviation of
the travel distances of teams is defined as the energy function, and the
Metropolis Monte-Carlo method combined with the simulated annealing technique
is applied to find the ground state configuration. The resulting tournament
schedule is found to satisfy all the constraint rules set by the Korean
Baseball Organization, but with drastically increased fairness in traveling
distances.
