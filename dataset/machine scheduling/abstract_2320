The MIT SuperCloud database management system allows for rapid creation and
flexible execution of a variety of the latest scientific databases, including
Apache Accumulo and SciDB. It is designed to permit these databases to run on a
High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC) platform as seamlessly as any other
HPCC job. It ensures the seamless migration of the databases to the resources
assigned by the HPCC scheduler and centralized storage of the database files
when not running. It also permits snapshotting of databases to allow
researchers to experiment and push the limits of the technology without
concerns for data or productivity loss if the database becomes unstable.
