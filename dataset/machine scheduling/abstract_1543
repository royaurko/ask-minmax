We characterize when the level sets of a continuous quasi-monotone functional
defined on a suitable convex subset of a normed space can be uniquely
represented by a family of bounded continuous functionals. Furthermore, we
investigate how regularly these functionals depend on the parameterizing level.
Finally, we show how this question relates to the recent problem of property
elicitation that simultaneously attracted interest in machine learning,
statistical evaluation of forecasts, and finance.
