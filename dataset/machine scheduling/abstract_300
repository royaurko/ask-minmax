This article aims at providing signal machines as small as possible able to
perform any computation (in the classical understanding). After presenting
signal machines, it is shown how to get universal ones from Turing machines,
cellular-automata and cyclic tag systems. Finally a halting universal signal
machine with 13 meta-signals and 21 collision rules is presented.
