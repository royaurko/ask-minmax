Recently, a negative interplay has been shown to arise when scheduling/AQM
techniques and low-priority congestion control protocols are used together:
namely, AQM resets the relative level of priority among congestion control
protocols. This work explores this issue by (i) studying a fluid model that
describes system dynamics of heterogeneous congestion control protocols
competing on a bottleneck link governed by AQM and (ii) proposing a system
level solution able to reinstate priorities among protocols.
