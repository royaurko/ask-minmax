X-ray observations with the ROSAT High Resolution Imager (HRI) often have
spatial smearing on the order of 10 arcsec (Morse 1994). This degradation of
the intrinsic resolution of the instrument (5 arcsec) can be attributed to
errors in the aspect solution associated with the wobble of the space craft or
with the reacquisition of the guide stars. We have developed a set of IRAF/PROS
and MIDAS/EXSAS routines to minimize these effects. Our procedure attempts to
isolate aspect errors that are repeated through each cycle of the wobble. The
method assigns a 'wobble phase' to each event based on the 402 second period of
the ROSAT wobble. The observation is grouped into a number of phase bins and a
centroid is calculated for each sub-image. The corrected HRI event list is
reconstructed by adding the sub-images which have been shifted to a common
source position. This method has shown approx. 30% reduction of the full width
half maximum (FWHM) of an X-ray observation of the radio galaxy 3C 120.
Additional examples are presented.
