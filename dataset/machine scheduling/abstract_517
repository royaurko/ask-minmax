Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been widely explored for forest fire
detection, which is considered a fatal threat throughout the world. Energy
conservation of sensor nodes is one of the biggest challenges in this context
and random scheduling is frequently applied to overcome that. The performance
analysis of these random scheduling approaches is traditionally done by
paper-and-pencil proof methods or simulation. These traditional techniques
cannot ascertain 100% accuracy, and thus are not suitable for analyzing a
safety-critical application like forest fire detection using WSNs. In this
paper, we propose to overcome this limitation by applying formal probabilistic
analysis using theorem proving to verify scheduling performance of a real-world
WSN for forest fire detection using a k-set randomized algorithm as an energy
saving mechanism. In particular, we formally verify the expected values of
coverage intensity, the upper bound on the total number of disjoint subsets,
for a given coverage intensity, and the lower bound on the total number of
nodes.
