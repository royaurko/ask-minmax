For the past 60 years, Research in machine translation is going on. For the
development in this field, a lot of new techniques are being developed each
day. As a result, we have witnessed development of many automatic machine
translators. A manager of machine translation development project needs to know
the performance increase/decrease, after changes have been done in his system.
Due to this reason, a need for evaluation of machine translation systems was
felt. In this article, we shall present the evaluation of some machine
translators. This evaluation will be done by a human evaluator and by some
automatic evaluation metrics, which will be done at sentence, document and
system level. In the end we shall also discuss the comparison between the
evaluations.
