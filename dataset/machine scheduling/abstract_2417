We propose an extensive analysis of the behavior of majority votes in binary
classification. In particular, we introduce a risk bound for majority votes,
called the C-bound, that takes into account the average quality of the voters
and their average disagreement. We also propose an extensive PAC-Bayesian
analysis that shows how the C-bound can be estimated from various observations
contained in the training data. The analysis intends to be self-contained and
can be used as introductory material to PAC-Bayesian statistical learning
theory. It starts from a general PAC-Bayesian perspective and ends with
uncommon PAC-Bayesian bounds. Some of these bounds contain no Kullback-Leibler
divergence and others allow kernel functions to be used as voters (via the
sample compression setting). Finally, out of the analysis, we propose the MinCq
learning algorithm that basically minimizes the C-bound. MinCq reduces to a
simple quadratic program. Aside from being theoretically grounded, MinCq
achieves state-of-the-art performance, as shown in our extensive empirical
comparison with both AdaBoost and the Support Vector Machine.
