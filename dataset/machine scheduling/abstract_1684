This paper is an experimental exploration of the relationship between the
runtimes of Turing machines and the length of proofs in formal axiomatic
systems. We compare the number of halting Turing machines of a given size to
the number of provable theorems of first-order logic of a given size, and the
runtime of the longest-running Turing machine of a given size to the proof
length of the most-difficult-to-prove theorem of a given size. It is suggested
that theorem provers are subject to the same non-linear tradeoff between time
and size as computer programs are, affording the possibility of determining
optimal timeouts and waiting times in automatic theorem proving. I provide the
statistics for some small choices of parameters for both of these systems.
