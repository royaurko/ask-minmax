The nature and complexity of software have changed significantly in the last
few decades. With the easy availability of computing power, deeper and broader
applications are made. It has been extremely necessary to produce good quality
software with high precession of reliability right in the first place. Olden
day's software errors and bugs were fixed at a later stage in the software
development. Today to produce high quality reliable software and to keep a
specific time schedule is a big challenge. To cope up the challenge many
concepts, methodology and practices of software engineering have been evolved
for developing reliable software. Better methods of controlling the process of
software production are underway. One of such methods to assess the software
reliability is using control charts. In this paper we proposed an NHPP based
control mechanism by using order statistics with cumulative quantity between
observations of failure data using mean value function of exponential
distribution.
