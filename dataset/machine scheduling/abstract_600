State-machine replication, a fundamental approach to fault tolerance,
requires replicas to execute commands deterministically, which usually results
in sequential execution of commands. Sequential execution limits performance
and underuses servers, which are increasingly parallel (i.e., multicore). To
narrow the gap between state-machine replication requirements and the
characteristics of modern servers, researchers have recently come up with
alternative execution models. This paper surveys existing approaches to
parallel state-machine replication and proposes a novel optimistic protocol
that inherits the scalable features of previous techniques. Using a replicated
B+-tree service, we demonstrate in the paper that our protocol outperforms the
most efficient techniques by a factor of 2.4 times.
