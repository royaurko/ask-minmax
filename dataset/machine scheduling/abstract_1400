A time machine that sends information back to the past may, in principle, be
built using closed time-like curves. However, the realization of a time machine
must be congruent with apparent paradoxes that arise from traveling back in
time. Using a simple model to analyze the consequences of time travel, we show
that several paradoxes, including the grandfather paradox and Deutsch's
unproven theorem paradox, are precluded by basic axioms of probability.
However, our model does not prohibit traveling back in time to affect past
events in a self-consistent manner.
