We assemble the equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
in 3+1 form. These consist of the complete coupled set of Maxwell equations for
the electromagnetic field, Einstein's equations for the gravitational field,
and the equations of relativistic MHD for a perfectly conducting ideal gas. The
adopted form of the equations is suitable for evolving numerically a
relativistic MHD fluid in a dynamical spacetime characterized by a strong
gravitational field.
