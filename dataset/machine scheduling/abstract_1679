We examine the minimum amount of memory for real-time, as opposed to one-way,
computation accepting nonregular languages. We consider deterministic,
nondeterministic and alternating machines working within strong, middle and
weak space, and processing general or unary inputs. In most cases, we are able
to show that the lower bounds for one-way machines remain tight in the
real-time case. Memory lower bounds for nonregular acceptance on other devices
are also addressed. It is shown that increasing the number of stacks of
real-time pushdown automata can result in exponential improvement in the total
amount of space usage for nonregular language recognition.
