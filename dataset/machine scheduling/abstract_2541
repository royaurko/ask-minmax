Conventional image sensors are only responsive to the intensity variation of
the incoming light wave. By encoding the wavefront information into the
balanced detection scheme, we demonstrate an image sensor pixel design that is
capable to detect both the local intensity and wavefront information
simultaneously. With the full compatibility to the CMOS fabrication process,
the proposed pixel design can benefit a variety of applications, including
phase microscopy, lensless imaging and machine vision.
