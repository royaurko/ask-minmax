A significant upgrade of the LHCb detector is scheduled to be installed in
2018-2019. Afterwards all sub-detectors will be read out at the LHC bunch
crossing frequency of 40 MHz and the trigger will be fully implemented in
software. The silicon strip vertex detector will be replaced by a hybrid pixel
detector. In these proceedings the following items are discussed: frontend
ASIC, data rates, data transmission, cooling, radiation hard sensors, module
design and simulated performance.
