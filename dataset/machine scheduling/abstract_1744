The study focused on the machine learning analysis approaches to identify the
adulteration of 9 kinds of edible oil qualitatively and answered the following
three questions: Is the oil sample adulterant? How does it constitute? What is
the main ingredient of the adulteration oil? After extracting the
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data on triglyceride from 370 oil
samples, we applied the adaptive boosting with multi-class Hamming loss
(AdaBoost.MH) to distinguish the oil adulteration in contrast with the support
vector machine (SVM). Further, we regarded the adulterant oil and the pure oil
samples as ones with multiple labels and with only one label, respectively.
Then multi-label AdaBoost.MH and multi-label learning vector quantization
(ML-LVQ) model were built to determine the ingredients and their relative ratio
in the adulteration oil. The experimental results on six measures show that
ML-LVQ achieves better performance than multi-label AdaBoost.MH.
