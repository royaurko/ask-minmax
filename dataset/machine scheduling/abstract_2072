Participating a scientific workshop is nowadays often an adventure because
the number of participants do seldom exceed the number of talks. A half-day
workshop is mostly finished at lunchtime, speakers are sometimes not present
and unexcused, and a strict progression of the workshop offers little air for
discussion. And when talks are re-scheduled on short notice in case that a
speech is dropped out, attaining guests definitely wonder why the presenter is
talking about something that does not match the previously announced talk. In
this respect, we believe that the organization of a workshop in the classical
sense must be reconsidered. It is not enough of compelling the presenters to
pay the registration fee only and to let the participants being impassive or
taken away mentally. With this work, we address several propositions to become
implemented in the future workshop organization. With that, we hope to
contribute to the identification of scientific workshops as a place of
interaction.
