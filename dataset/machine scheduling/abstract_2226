Online social networks have become a major communication platform, where
people share their thoughts and opinions about any topic real-time. The short
text updates people post in these network contain emotions and moods, which
when measured collectively can unveil the public mood at population level and
have exciting implications for businesses, governments, and societies.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing solid methods for accurately
measuring moods from large-scale social media data. In this paper, we propose
PANAS-t, which measures sentiments from short text updates in Twitter based on
a well-established psychometric scale, PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect
Schedule). We test the efficacy of PANAS-t over 10 real notable events drawn
from 1.8 billion tweets and demonstrate that it can efficiently capture the
expected sentiments of a wide variety of issues spanning tragedies, technology
releases, political debates, and healthcare.
