The singular way of scheduling at major observatories has favored certain
types of astronomy. This has led to the discrimination of certain types of
observations which could not be accommodated. It is the goal of future
operations to open possibilities for some additional types of observational
astronomy. Together with improved observatory operations the new observing
modes can provide significant progress in the acquisition of astronomical data.
Specifically, the capability to optimally match the schedule to observations
should prove a major advantage of service observing.
  The VLT data flow project is designed to accommodate these new observing
modes together with conventional observing. Simulations and first experience
with the ESO NTT will prepare and refine the concepts and procedures foreseen
for the VLT. The acceptance of service observing by the astronomical community
is of critical importance for this new operational mode to succeed.
