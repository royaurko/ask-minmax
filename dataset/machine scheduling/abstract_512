Demand-side management (DSM) is becoming an increasingly important component
of the envisioned smart grid. The ability to improve the efficiency of energy
use in the power system by altering demand is widely viewed as being not merely
promising but in fact essential. However, while the advantages of DSM are
clear, arriving at an efficient implementation has so far proven to be less
straightforward. There have recently been many proposals put forth in the
literature to tackle the demand scheduling aspect of DSM. One particular
approach based on a game-theoretic treatment of the day-ahead load-scheduling
problem has recently gained tremendous popularity in the DSM literature. In
this letter, an assessment of this approach is conducted, and its main result
is challenged.
