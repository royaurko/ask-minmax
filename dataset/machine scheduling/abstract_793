Iterative processing is widely adopted nowadays in modern wireless receivers
for advanced channel codes like turbo and LDPC codes. Extension of this
principle with an additional iterative feedback loop to the demapping function
has proven to provide substantial error performance gain. However, the adoption
of iterative demodulation with turbo decoding is constrained by the additional
implied implementation complexity, heavily impacting latency and power
consumption. In this paper, we analyze the convergence speed of these combined
two iterative processes in order to determine the exact required number of
iterations at each level. Extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts are used
for a thorough analysis at different modulation orders and code rates. An
original iteration scheduling is proposed reducing two demapping iterations
with reasonable performance loss of less than 0.15 dB. Analyzing and
normalizing the computational and memory access complexity, which directly
impact latency and power consumption, demonstrates the considerable gains of
the proposed scheduling and the promising contributions of the proposed
analysis.
