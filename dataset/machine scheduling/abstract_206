IEEE 802.11n mainly aims to provide high throughput, reliability and good
security over its other previous standards. The performance of 802.11n is very
effective on the saturated traffic through the use of frame aggregation. But
this frame aggregation will not effectively function in all scenarios. The main
objective of this paper is to improve the throughput of the wireless LAN
through effective frame aggregation using scheduler mechanism. The Bi-Scheduler
algorithm proposed in this article aims to segregate frames based on their
access categories. The outer scheduler separates delay sensitive applications
from the incoming burst of multi-part data and also decides whether to apply
Aggregated - MAC Service Data Unit (A-MSDU) aggregation technique or to send
the data without any aggregation. The inner scheduler schedules the remaining
(delay-insensitive, background and best-effort) packets using Aggregated-MAC
Protocol Data unit (A-MPDU) aggregation technique
