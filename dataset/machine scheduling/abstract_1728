Given a machine U, a c-short program for x is a string p such that U(p)=x and
the length of p is bounded by c + (the length of a shortest program for x). We
show that for any universal machine, it is possible to compute in polynomial
time on input x a list of polynomial size guaranteed to contain a
O(log|x|)-short program for x. We also show that there exist computable
functions that map every x to a list of size O(|x|^2) containing a O(1)-short
program for x and this is essentially optimal because we prove that such a list
must have size O(|x|^2) . Finally we show that for some machines, computable
lists containing a shortest program must have length Omega(2^|x|) .
