Nature has evolved many molecular machines such as kinesin, myosin, and the
rotary flagellar motor powered by an ion current from the mitochondria. Direct
observation of the step-like motion of these machines with time series from
novel experimental assays has recently become possible. These time series are
corrupted by molecular and experimental noise that requires removal, but
classical signal processing is of limited use for recovering such step-like
dynamics. This paper reports simple, novel Bayesian filters that are robust to
step-like dynamics in noise, and introduce an L1-regularized, global filter
whose sparse solution can be rapidly obtained by standard convex optimization
methods. We show these techniques outperforming classical filters on simulated
time series in terms of their ability to accurately recover the underlying step
dynamics. To show the techniques in action, we extract step-like speed
transitions from Rhodobacter sphaeroides flagellar motor time series. Code
