Machine Translation for Indian languages is an emerging research area.
Transliteration is one such module that we design while designing a translation
system. Transliteration means mapping of source language text into the target
language. Simple mapping decreases the efficiency of overall translation
system. We propose the use of stemming and part-of-speech tagging for
transliteration. The effectiveness of translation can be improved if we use
part-of-speech tagging and stemming assisted transliteration.We have shown that
much of the content in Gujarati gets transliterated while being processed for
translation to Hindi language.
