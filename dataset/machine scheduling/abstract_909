We introduce a model of infinitary computation which enhances the infinite
time Turing machine model slightly but in a natural way by giving the machines
the capability of detecting cardinal stages of computation. The computational
strength with respect to ITTMs is determined to be precisely that of the strong
halting problem and the nature of the new characteristic ordinals (clockable,
writable, etc.) is explored.
