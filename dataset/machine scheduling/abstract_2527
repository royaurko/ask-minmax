This paper summarises the current state-of-the art in the study of
compositionality in distributional semantics, and major challenges for this
area. We single out generalised quantifiers and intensional semantics as areas
on which to focus attention for the development of the theory. Once suitable
theories have been developed, algorithms will be needed to apply the theory to
tasks. Evaluation is a major problem; we single out application to recognising
textual entailment and machine translation for this purpose.
