We study a sorting machine consisting of two stacks in series where the first
stack has the added restriction such that entries in the stack must be in
decreasing order from top to bottom. We give the basis of the class of
permutations that are sortable by this machine which shows that it is
enumerated by the Schr\"oder numbers.
