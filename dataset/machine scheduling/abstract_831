This paper presents a hardware architecture of fast successive cancellation
(SC) algorithm for polar codes, which significantly reduces the decoding
latency and dramatically increases the throughput. Algorithmically, Fast SC
algorithm suffers from the fact that its decoder scheduling and the consequent
architecture depends on the code rate; this is a big challenge for
rate-compatible system. However, by exploiting the homogeneousness between the
decoding processes of fast constituent polar codes and regular polar codes, the
presented design is compatible with any rate. The scheduling plan and the
intendedly designed process core are also described. Results show that,
compared with the 2b-SC-Precomputation decoder, known to be the fastest ASIC
design of SC decoder, our proposed design can achieve at least 60% latency
reduction for the codes with length N = 1024. For example, a latency reduction
of 79.66% at the rate of 0.85 and 65.31% at the rate of 0.5. By using Nangate
FreePDK 45nm process, proposed design can reach throughput up to 5.81 Gbps and
2.00 Gbps for (1024, 870) and (1024, 512) polar code, respectively.
