This paper shows that the main features of Turing's thesis derived from those
of the expression system (Turing machines) it inaugures, and in particular its
conformity. The notions of inaugural statements and texts are defined and
illustrated by other examples than Turing thesis and article. Other
relationships between the inaugural texts are considered which allow to include
Turing's article in an inaugural history.
