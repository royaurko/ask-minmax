Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to train computers to perform a
variety of complex tasks and improve with experience. Computers learn how to
recognize patterns, make unintended decisions, or react to a dynamic
environment. Certain trained machines may be more effective than others because
they are based on more suitable ML algorithms or because they were trained
through superior training sets. Although ML algorithms are known and publicly
released, training sets may not be reasonably ascertainable and, indeed, may be
guarded as trade secrets. While much research has been performed about the
privacy of the elements of training sets, in this paper we focus our attention
on ML classifiers and on the statistical information that can be unconsciously
or maliciously revealed from them. We show that it is possible to infer
unexpected but useful information from ML classifiers. In particular, we build
a novel meta-classifier and train it to hack other classifiers, obtaining
meaningful information about their training sets. This kind of information
leakage can be exploited, for example, by a vendor to build more effective
classifiers or to simply acquire trade secrets from a competitor's apparatus,
potentially violating its intellectual property rights.
