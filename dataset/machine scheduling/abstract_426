In November 2001 we undertook a coordinated observing campaign to study the
connection between X-ray and optical variability in the weak-line T Tauri star
V410Tau. The observing plan included three 15 ksec observations with Chandra
using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer for Spectroscopy scheduled for
different phases of the known 1.87 d starspot cycle. Photometric and
spectroscopic monitoring of V410Tau involving telescopes on three different
continents was scheduled simultaneously with the Chandra exposures.
