Machining time is a major performance criterion when it comes to high-speed
machining. CAM software can help in estimating that time for a given strategy.
But in practice, CAM-programmed feed rates are rarely achieved, especially
where complex surface finishing is concerned. This means that machining time
forecasts are often more than one step removed from reality. The reason behind
this is that CAM routines do not take either the dynamic performances of the
machines or their specific machining tolerances into account. The present
article seeks to improve simulation of high-speed NC machine dynamic behaviour
and machining time prediction, offering two models. The first contributes
through enhanced simulation of three-axis paths in linear and circular
interpolation, taking high-speed machine accelerations and jerks into account.
The second model allows transition passages between blocks to be integrated in
the simulation by adding in a polynomial transition path that caters for the
true machining environment tolerances. Models are based on respect for path
monitoring. Experimental validation shows the contribution of polynomial
modelling of the transition passage due to the absence of a leap in
acceleration. Simulation error on the machining time prediction remains below
1%.
