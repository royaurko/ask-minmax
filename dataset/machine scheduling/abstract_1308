Collisions are a main cause of throughput degradation in WLANs. The current
contention mechanism used in IEEE 802.11 networks is called Carrier Sense
Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). It uses a Binary
Exponential Backoff (BEB) technique to randomise each contender attempt of
transmitting, effectively reducing the collision probability. Nevertheless,
CSMA/CA relies on a random backoff that while effective and totally
distributed, in principle is unable to completely eliminate collisions,
therefore degrading the network throughput as more contenders attempt to share
the channel. Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Enhanced Collision Avoidance
(CSMA/ECA) is able to create a collision-free schedule in a totally distributed
manner using a deterministic backoff after successful transmissions. Hysteresis
and Fair Share are two extensions of CSMA/ECA to support a large number of
contenders in a collision-free schedule. CSMA/ECA offers better throughput than
CSMA/CA and short-term throughput fairness.
  This work describes CSMA/ECA and its extensions. Additionally, it provides
the first evaluation results of CSMA/ECA in non-saturated traffic conditions as
well as its performance when coexisting with CSMA/CA nodes. Furthermore, the
effects of imperfect clocks over CSMA/ECA's deterministic backoff mechanism and
its consequences when attempting to implement the protocol in real hardware are
also analysed.
