The knowledge of the different types of emergence is essential if we want to
understand and master complex systems in science and engineering, respectively.
This paper specifies a universal taxonomy and comprehensive classification of
the major types and forms of emergence in Multi-Agent Systems, from simple
types of intentional and predictable emergence in machines to more complex
forms of weak, multiple and strong emergence.
