We survey existing scheduling hypotheses made in the literature in
self-stabilization, commonly referred to under the notion of daemon. We show
that four main characteristics (distribution, fairness, boundedness, and
enabledness) are enough to encapsulate the various differences presented in
existing work. Our naming scheme makes it easy to compare daemons of particular
classes, and to extend existing possibility or impossibility results to new
daemons. We further examine existing daemon transformer schemes and provide the
exact transformed characteristics of those transformers in our taxonomy.
