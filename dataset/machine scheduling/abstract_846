We study Turing machines that are allowed absolutely no space overhead. The
only work space the machines have, beyond the fixed amount of memory implicit
in their finite-state control, is that which they can create by cannibalizing
the input bits' own space. This model more closely reflects the fixed-sized
memory of real computers than does the standard complexity-theoretic model of
linear space.
  Though some context-sensitive languages cannot be accepted by such machines,
we show that all context-free languages can be accepted nondeterministically in
polynomial time with absolutely no space overhead, and that all deterministic
context-free languages can be accepted deterministically in polynomial time
with absolutely no space overhead.
