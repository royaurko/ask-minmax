The capacity of a learning machine is measured by its Vapnik-Chervonenkis
dimension, and learning machines with a low VC dimension generalize better. It
is well known that the VC dimension of SVMs can be very large or unbounded,
even though they generally yield state-of-the-art learning performance. In this
paper, we show how to learn a hyperplane regressor by minimizing an exact, or
\boldmath{$\Theta$} bound on its VC dimension. The proposed approach, termed as
the Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) Regressor, involves solving a simple
linear programming problem. Experimental results show, that on a number of
benchmark datasets, the proposed approach yields regressors with error rates
much less than those obtained with conventional SVM regresssors, while often
using fewer support vectors. On some benchmark datasets, the number of support
vectors is less than one tenth the number used by SVMs, indicating that the MCM
does indeed learn simpler representations.
