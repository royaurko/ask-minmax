In the last few years, due to the growing ubiquity of unlabeled data, much
effort has been spent by the machine learning community to develop better
understanding and improve the quality of classifiers exploiting unlabeled data.
Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector
Machines (LapSVMs) have shown the state of the art performance in
semi--supervised classification. In this paper we present two strategies to
solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the
original dual formulation. Whereas training a LapSVM in the dual requires two
steps, using the primal form allows us to collapse training to a single step.
Moreover, the computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced
from O(n^3) to O(n^2) using preconditioned conjugate gradient, where n is the
combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples. We speed up training by
using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or,
if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to
quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification
accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. Due to
its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for
additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for
dealing with large datasets. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on
real world data showing the benefits of the proposed approach.
