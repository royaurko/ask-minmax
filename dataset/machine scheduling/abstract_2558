We present reconstruction algorithms for smooth signals with block sparsity
from their compressed measurements. We tackle the issue of varying group size
via group-sparse least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) as well as
via latent group LASSO regularizations. We achieve smoothness in the signal via
fusion. We develop low-complexity solvers for our proposed formulations through
the alternating direction method of multipliers.
