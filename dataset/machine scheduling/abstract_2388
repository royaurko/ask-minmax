Vast amounts of text on the Web are unstructured and ungrammatical, such as
classified ads, auction listings, forum postings, etc. We call such text
"posts." Despite their inconsistent structure and lack of grammar, posts are
full of useful information. This paper presents work on semi-automatically
building tables of relational information, called "reference sets," by
analyzing such posts directly. Reference sets can be applied to a number of
tasks such as ontology maintenance and information extraction. Our
reference-set construction method starts with just a small amount of background
knowledge, and constructs tuples representing the entities in the posts to form
a reference set. We also describe an extension to this approach for the special
case where even this small amount of background knowledge is impossible to
discover and use. To evaluate the utility of the machine-constructed reference
sets, we compare them to manually constructed reference sets in the context of
reference-set-based information extraction. Our results show the reference sets
constructed by our method outperform manually constructed reference sets. We
also compare the reference-set-based extraction approach using the
machine-constructed reference set to supervised extraction approaches using
generic features. These results demonstrate that using machine-constructed
reference sets outperforms the supervised methods, even though the supervised
methods require training data.
