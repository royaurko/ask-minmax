We describe the data reduction pipeline and control system for the RoboPol
project. The RoboPol project is monitoring the optical $R$-band magnitude and
linear polarization of a large sample of active galactic nuclei that is
dominated by blazars. The pipeline calibrates and reduces each exposure frame,
producing a measurement of the magnitude and linear polarization of every
source in the $13'\times 13'$ field of view. The control system combines a
dynamic scheduler, real-time data reduction, and telescope automation to allow
high-efficiency unassisted observations.
