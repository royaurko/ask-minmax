The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) released a set of
specifications to define a restful architecture for enabling seamless service
provisioning across heterogeneous Machine-to-Machine (M2M) systems. The current
version of this architecture is strongly centralized, thus requiring new
enhancements to its scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. To bridge
this gap, herein it is presented an Overlay Service Capability Layer, based on
Information Centric Networking design. Key features, example use cases and
preliminary performance assessments are also discussed to highlight the
potential of our approach.
