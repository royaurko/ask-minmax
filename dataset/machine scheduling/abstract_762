This paper studies a diffusion model that arises as the limit of a queueing
system scheduling problem in the asymptotic heavy traffic regime of Halfin and
Whitt. The queueing system consists of several customer classes and many
servers working in parallel, grouped in several stations. Servers in different
stations offer service to customers of each class at possibly different rates.
The control corresponds to selecting what customer class each server serves at
each time. The diffusion control problem does not seem to have explicit
solutions and therefore a characterization of optimal solutions via the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is addressed. Our main result is the existence
and uniqueness of solutions of the equation. Since the model is set on an
unbounded domain and the cost per unit time is unbounded, the analysis requires
estimates on the state process that are subexponential in the time variable. In
establishing these estimates, a key role is played by an integral formula that
relates queue length and idle time processes, which may be of independent
interest.
