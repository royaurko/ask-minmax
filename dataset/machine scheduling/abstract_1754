We propose a new approach, multi-view Laplacian support vector machines
(SVMs), for semi-supervised learning under the multi-view scenario. It
integrates manifold regularization and multi-view regularization into the usual
formulation of SVMs and is a natural extension of SVMs from supervised learning
to multi-view semi-supervised learning. The function optimization problem in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space is converted to an optimization in a
finite-dimensional Euclidean space. After providing a theoretical bound for the
generalization performance of the proposed method, we further give a
formulation of the empirical Rademacher complexity which affects the bound
significantly. From this bound and the empirical Rademacher complexity, we can
gain insights into the roles played by different regularization terms to the
generalization performance. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world
data sets are presented, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed
multi-view Laplacian SVMs approach.
