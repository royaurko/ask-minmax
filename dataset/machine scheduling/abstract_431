The subject of the 5th challenge proposed by the French Society of Operations
Research and Decision Analysis (ROADEF) consists in scheduling technicians and
interventions for telecommunications
(http://www.g-scop.inpg.fr/ChallengeROADEF2007/ or http://www.roadef.org/). We
detail the algorithm we proposed for this challenge which is a Greedy
Randomized Adaptative Search Procedure (GRASP). Computational results led us to
the 1st position in the Junior category and to the 4th position in All category
of the Challenge ROADEF 2007.
