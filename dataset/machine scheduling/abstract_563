This paper introduces a new machine architecture for evaluating lambda
expressions using the normal-order reduction, which guarantees that every
lambda expression will be evaluated if the expression has its normal form and
the system has enough memory. The architecture considered here operates using
heap memory only. Lambda expressions are represented as graphs, and all
algorithms used in the processing unit of this machine are non-recursive.
