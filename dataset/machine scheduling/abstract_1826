Frank-Wolfe algorithms have recently regained the attention of the Machine
Learning community. Their solid theoretical properties and sparsity guarantees
make them a suitable choice for a wide range of problems in this field. In
addition, several variants of the basic procedure exist that improve its
theoretical properties and practical performance. In this paper, we investigate
the application of some of these techniques to Machine Learning, focusing in
particular on a Parallel Tangent (PARTAN) variant of the FW algorithm that has
not been previously suggested or studied for this type of problems. We provide
experiments both in a standard setting and using a stochastic speed-up
technique, showing that the considered algorithms obtain promising results on
several medium and large-scale benchmark datasets for SVM classification.
