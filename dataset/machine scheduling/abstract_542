In the context of product quality, the methods that can be used to estimate
machining defects and predict causes of these defects are one of the important
factors of a manufacturing process. The two approaches that are presented in
this article are used to determine the machining defects. The first approach
uses the Small Displacement Torsor (SDT) concept [BM] to determine displacement
dispersions (translations and rotations) of machined surfaces. The second one,
which takes into account form errors of machined surface (i.e. twist, comber,
undulation), uses a geometrical model based on the modal shape's properties,
namely the form parameterization method [FS1]. A case study is then carried out
to analyze the machining defects of a batch of machined parts.
