We introduce a notion of real-valued reward testing for probabilistic
processes by extending the traditional nonnegative-reward testing with negative
rewards. In this richer testing framework, the may and must preorders turn out
to be inverses. We show that for convergent processes with finitely many states
and transitions, but not in the presence of divergence, the real-reward
must-testing preorder coincides with the nonnegative-reward must-testing
preorder. To prove this coincidence we characterise the usual resolution-based
testing in terms of the weak transitions of processes, without having to
involve policies, adversaries, schedulers, resolutions, or similar structures
that are external to the process under investigation. This requires
establishing the continuity of our function for calculating testing outcomes.
