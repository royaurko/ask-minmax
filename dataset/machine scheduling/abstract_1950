RXTE ASM count rates from the X-ray pulsar Her X-1 began falling consistently
during the late months of 2003. The source is undergoing another state
transition similar to the anomalous low state of 1999. This new event has
triggered observations from both space- and ground-based observatories. In
order to aid data interpretation and telescope scheduling, and to facilitate
the phase-connection of cycles before and after the state transition, we have
re-calculated the precession ephemeris using cycles over the last 3.5 years. We
report that the source has displayed a different precession period since the
last anomalous event. Additional archival data from CGRO suggests that each low
state is accompanied by a change in precession period and that the subsequent
period is correlated with accretion flux. Consequently our analysis reveals
long-term accretion disk behaviour which is predicted by theoretical models of
radiation-driven warping.
