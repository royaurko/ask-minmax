Rapid progress in microelectromechanical system (MEMS) and radio frequency
(RF) design has enabled the development of low-power, inexpensive, and
network-enabled microsensors. These sensor nodes are capable of capturing
various physical information, such as temperature, pressure, motion of an
object, etc as well as mapping such physical characteristics of the environment
to quantitative measurements. A typical wireless sensor network (WSN) consists
of hundreds to thousands of such sensor nodes linked by a wireless medium. In
this paper, we present a comparative investigation of energy consumption for
few commercially available chipsets such as TR1001, CC1000 and CC1010 based on
different scheduling methods for two types of deployment strategies. We
conducted our experiment within the OMNeT++ simulator.
