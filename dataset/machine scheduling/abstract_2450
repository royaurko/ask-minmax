DAFNE induced backgrounds are dominated by Touschek scattering [1]. A
luminosity upgrade of the machine at the same beam energy would be obtained
essentially by increasing the bunch density, that in principle would increase
this particle loss process. Some preliminary studies and general considerations
of the Touschek effect for the DAFNE high luminosity upgrade are presented
here.
