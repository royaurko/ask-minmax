It is well known that in a firm real time system with a renewal arrival
process, exponential service times and independent and identically distributed
deadlines till the end of service of a job, the earliest deadline first (EDF)
scheduling policy has smaller loss ratio (expected fraction of jobs, not
completed) than any other service time independent scheduling policy, including
the first come first served (FCFS). Various modifications to the EDF and FCFS
policies have been proposed in the literature, with a view to improving
performance. In this article, we compare the loss ratios of these two policies
along with some of the said modifications, as well as their counterparts with
deterministic deadlines. The results include some formal inequalities and some
counter-examples to establish non-existence of an order. A few relations
involving loss ratios are posed as conjectures, and simulation results in
support of these are reported. These results lead to a complete picture of
dominance and non-dominance relations between pairs of scheduling policies, in
terms of loss ratios.
