I present interferometric images (approx. 7" resolution) of CO emission in
five elliptical galaxies and nondetections in two others. These data double the
number of elliptical galaxies whose CO emission has been fully mapped. The
sample galaxies have 10^8 to 5x10^9 solar masses of molecular gas distributed
in mostly symmetric rotating disks with diameters of 2 to 12 kpc. Four out of
the five molecular disks show remarkable alignment with the optical major axes
of their host galaxies. The molecular masses are a few percent of the total
dynamical masses which are implied if the gas is on circular orbits. If the
molecular gas forms stars, it will make rotationally supported stellar disks
which will be very similar in character to the stellar disks now known to be
present in many ellipticals. Comparison of stellar kinematics to gas kinematics
in NGC 4476 implies that the molecular gas did not come from internal stellar
mass loss because the specific angular momentum of the gas is about three times
larger than that of the stars.
