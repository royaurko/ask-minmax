In wireless ad hoc or sensor networks, distributed node coloring is a
fundamental problem closely related to establishing efficient communication
through TDMA schedules. For networks with maximum degree Delta, a Delta + 1
coloring is the ultimate goal in the distributed setting as this is always
possible. In this work we propose Delta + 1 coloring algorithms for the
synchronous and asynchronous setting. All algorithms have a runtime of O(Delta
log n) time slots. This improves on the previous algorithms for the SINR model
either in terms of the number of required colors or the runtime and matches the
runtime of local broadcasting in the SINR model (which can be seen as a lower
bound).
