The International Large Detector (ILD) is one of the proposed detector
concepts for the International Linear Collider (ILC). The work on the ILD
machine-detector interface (MDI) concentrates on the optimisation of the
experimental area design for the operation and maintenance of the detector. The
ILC will use a push-pull system to allow the operation of two detectors at one
interaction region. The special requirements of this system pose technical
constraints to the interaction region and the design of both detectors.
