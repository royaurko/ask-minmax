We present the results of optical identification of two X-ray sources from
RXTE and INTEGRAL all sky surveys: XSS J00564+4548 and IGR J00234+6141. Using
the optical data from Russian-Turkish 1.5-m Telescope (RTT150) and SWIFT X-ray
observations, we show that these sources most probably are intermediate polars,
i.e. binary systems with accreting white dwarfs with not very strong magnetic
field (<~10 MG). Periodical oscillations of optical emission with periods 480 s
and 570 s were found. We argue that these periods most probably correspond to
the rotating periods of the white dwarfs in these systems. Further optical
observations scheduled at RTT150 will allow to study the parameters of these
systems in more detail.
