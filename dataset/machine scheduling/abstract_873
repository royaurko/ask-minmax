We report on the generation of high-order optical vortices by spiral phase
mirrors. The phase mirrors are produced by direct machining with a diamond tool
and are shown to produce high-quality optical vortices with topological charges
ranging from 1 to 1000 at a wavelength of 532 nm. The direct machining
technique is flexible and offers the promise of high-precision, large-diameter
spiral phase mirrors that are compatible with high optical powers.
