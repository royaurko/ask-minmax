We present a summary of the most recent measurements relevant to Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD) delivered by the D0 and CDF Tevatron experiments by May
2008. CDF and D0 are moving toward precision measurements of QCD based on data
samples in excess of 1 fb-1. The inclusive jet cross sections have been
extended to forward rapidity regions and measured with unprecedented precision
following improvements in the jet energy calibration. Results on dijet mass
distributions, bbbar dijet production using tracker based triggers, underlying
event in dijet and Drell-Yan samples, inclusive photon and diphoton cross
sections complete the list of measurements included in this paper. Good
agreement with pQCD within errors is observed for jet production measurements.
An improved and consistent theoretical description is needed for photon+jets
processes. Collisions at the LHC are scheduled for early fall 2008, opening an
era of discoveries at the new energy frontier, 5-7 times higher than that of
the Tevatron.
