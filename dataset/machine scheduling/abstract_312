In the workspace model of machining an experimental procedure is implemented
to determine the elastic behaviour of the machining system. In an other work we
have proposed a static characterization of the machining system. In this paper
a dynamic characterization and vibration analysis have long been used for the
detection and identification of machine tool condition. The natural frequencies
of the lathe machining system (Ernault HN400 - France) according with three
different situations with no cutting process were acquired. The system modal
analysis is used to identify the natural frequencies. These ones and these
obtained on the spindle numerical model by finite element method are compared.
This research is validated by experimental tests being based to measures of the
lathe machine tool frequencies domain. Main focus is to identify a procedure to
obtain natural frequencies values for machine tool components in order to
establish better conditions in the cutting process on the machine tool.
