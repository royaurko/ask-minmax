We consider a transmission of a delay-sensitive data stream from a single
source to a single destination. The reliability of this transmission may suffer
from bursty packet losses - the predominant type of failures in today's
Internet. An effective and well studied solution to this problem is to protect
the data by a Forward Error Correction (FEC) code and send the FEC packets over
multiple paths.
  In this paper we show that the performance of such a multipath FEC scheme can
often be further improved. Our key observation is that the propagation times on
the available paths often significantly differ, typically by 10-100ms.
  We propose to exploit these differences by appropriate packet scheduling that
we call `Spread'. We evaluate our solution with a precise, analytical
formulation and trace-driven simulations. Our studies show that Spread
substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions. It typically achieves
two- to five-fold improvement (reduction) in the effective loss rate. Or
conversely, keeping the same level of effective loss rate, Spread significantly
decreases the observed delays and helps fighting the delay jitter.
