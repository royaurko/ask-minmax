The lexicalist approach to Machine Translation offers significant advantages
in the development of linguistic descriptions. However, the Shake-and-Bake
generation algorithm of (Whitelock, COLING-92) is NP-complete. We present a
polynomial time algorithm for lexicalist MT generation provided that sufficient
information can be transferred to ensure more determinism.
