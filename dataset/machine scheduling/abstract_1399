The LHC offers a unique opportunity to investigate an ample spectra of
phenomenous ranging from the Electro-Weak (EW) to the QCD sector of the
Standard Model (SM). Among the quantities which can be measured in the LHC
experiments are the CP and production asymmetries for several particles in a
wide variety of decay modes. In this work we discuss about the interplay
between production and CP asymmetries for particles produced in proton-proton
interactions and the effects of one on the measurement of the other. This kind
of effects are not present in flavor symmetric machines like the Tevatron or
$e^+-e^-$ colliders.
