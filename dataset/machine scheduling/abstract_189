Computational Grids, emerging as an infrastructure for next generation
computing, enable the sharing, selection, and aggregation of geographically
distributed resources for solving large-scale problems in science, engineering,
and commerce. As the resources in the Grid are heterogeneous and geographically
distributed with varying availability and a variety of usage and cost policies
for diverse users at different times and, priorities as well as goals that vary
with time. The management of resources and application scheduling in such a
large and distributed environment is a complex task. This thesis proposes a
distributed computational economy as an effective metaphor for the management
of resources and application scheduling. It proposes an architectural framework
that supports resource trading and quality of services based scheduling. It
enables the regulation of supply and demand for resources and provides an
incentive for resource owners for participating in the Grid and motives the
users to trade-off between the deadline, budget, and the required level of
quality of service. The thesis demonstrates the capability of economic-based
systems for peer-to-peer distributed computing by developing users'
quality-of-service requirements driven scheduling strategies and algorithms. It
demonstrates their effectiveness by performing scheduling experiments on the
World-Wide Grid for solving parameter sweep applications.
