SETILive is a web project forwarding radio signals from SETI Institute's
Allen Telescope Array (ATA) for the analysis of volunteers. It contains a large
archive with more than 1.5 millions observations for more than 7.5 thousands
observation targets, including directions to exoplanets discovered by telescope
Kepler and other sources. It also supports various tools for signal collection
and classification. Till recent time it supported live feeds of signals from
ATA together with a feedback loop, a possibility to interrupt the schedule and
repeat the observation of an interesting signal registered by sufficiently many
viewers. Unfortunately, since 12-Oct-2014 the live feeds have been
discontinued. We hope that the project will persist, taking into account the
importance of the search subject, the worldwide interest to the topic and the
value of already collected data. In this paper we present the results of
statistical analysis of data stored in SETILive archive, using Radon transform
and specially constructed filter for selection of single beams, potential
signals of ET origination. We will also estimate statistical significance of
signals depending on their signal-to-noise ratio using Monte Carlo simulation
and select 28 strong signals and totally 1072 statistically significant signals
in the archive.
