Myopic is a hard real-time process scheduling algorithm that selects a
suitable process based on a heuristic function from a subset (Window)of all
ready processes instead of choosing from all available processes, like original
heuristic scheduling algorithm. Performance of the algorithm significantly
depends on the chosen heuristic function that assigns weight to different
parameters like deadline, earliest starting time, processing time etc. and the
sizeof the Window since it considers only k processes from n processes (where,
k<= n). This research evaluates the performance of the Myopic algorithm for
different parameters to demonstrate the merits and constraints of the
algorithm. A comparative performance of the impact of window size in
implementing the Myopic algorithm is presented and discussed through a set of
experiments.
