This paper proposes a fair and efficient QoS scheduling scheme for IEEE
802.16 BWA systems that satisfies both throughput and delay guarantee to
various real and non-real time applications. The proposed QoS scheduling scheme
is compared with an existing QoS scheduling scheme proposed in literature in
recent past. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling scheme can
provide a tight QoS guarantee in terms of delay, delay violation rate and
throughput for all types of traffic as defined in the WiMAX standard, thereby
maintaining the fairness and helps to eliminate starvation of lower priority
class services. Bandwidth utilization of the system and fairness index of the
resources are also encountered to validate the QoS provided by our proposed
scheduling scheme.
