High-performance computing (HPC) systems are a complex combination of
software, processors, memory, networks, and storage systems characterized by
frequent disruptive technological advances. Anomalous behavior has to be
manually diagnosed and remedied with incomplete and sparse data. It also has
been effort-intensive for users to assess the effectiveness with which they are
using the available resources. The data available for system level analyses
appear from multiple sources and in disparate formats (from Linux "sysstat" and
accounting to scheduler/kernel logs). Sysstat does not resolve its measurements
by job so that job-oriented analyses require individual measurements. There are
many user-oriented performance instrumentation and profiling tools but they
require extensive system knowledge, code changes and recompilation, and thus
are not widely used. To address this issue, we develop TACC_Stats, a
job-oriented and logically structured version of the conventional Linux
"sysstat/sar" system-wide performance monitor. We use TACC_Stats-collected data
from a supercomputer "Ranger" to demonstrate its effectiveness in two case
studies.
