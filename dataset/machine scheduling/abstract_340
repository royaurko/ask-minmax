In end-to-end distributed real time systems, a task may be executed
sequentially on different processors. The end-toend task response time must not
exceed the end-to-end task deadline to consider the task a schedulable task. In
transient over load periods, deadlines may be missed or processors may
saturate. The imprecise computation technique is a way to overcome the
mentioned problems by trading off precision and timeliness. We developed an
imprecise integrated framework for scheduling fixed priority end-to-end tasks
in distributed real time systems by extending an existing integrated framework
for the same problem. We devised a new priority assignment scheme called global
mandatory relevance scheme to meet the concept of imprecise computation. We
devised an algorithm for processor utilization adjustment, this algorithm
decreases the processor load when the processor utilization is greater than
one. Also we extended the schedulability analysis algorithms presented in the
old framework to allow adaptive priority assignment and to meet imprecise
computation concept. Simulation results showed that our new framework is more
dependable and predictable than the existing framework over transient overload
periods.
