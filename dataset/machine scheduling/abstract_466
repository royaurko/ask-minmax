We propose constant approximation algorithms for generalizations of the
Flexible Flow Shop (FFS) problem which form a realistic model for
non-preemptive scheduling in MapReduce systems. Our results concern the
minimization of the total weighted completion time of a set of MapReduce jobs
on unrelated processors and improve substantially on the model proposed by
Moseley et al. (SPAA 2011) in two directions. First, we consider each job
consisting of multiple Map and Reduce tasks, as this is the key idea behind
MapReduce computations, and we propose a constant approximation algorithm.
Then, we introduce into our model the crucial cost of data shuffle phase, i.e.,
the cost for the transmission of intermediate data from Map to Reduce tasks. In
fact, we model this phase by an additional set of Shuffle tasks for each job
and we manage to keep the same approximation ratio when they are scheduled on
the same processors with the corresponding Reduce tasks and to provide also a
constant ratio when they are scheduled on different processors. This is the
most general setting of the FFS problem (with a special third stage) for which
a constant approximation ratio is known.
