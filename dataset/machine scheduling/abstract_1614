A machine capable of digitizing two 8 inch by 10 inch (203 mm by 254 mm)
glass astrophotographic plates or a single 14 inch by 17 inch (356 mm by 432
mm) plate at a resolution of 11 microns per pixel or 2309 dots per inch (dpi)
in 92 seconds is described. The purpose of the machine is to digitize the
\~500,000 plate collection of the Harvard College Observatory in a five year
time frame. The digitization must meet the requirements for scientific work in
astrometry, photometry, and archival preservation of the plates. This paper
describes the requirements for and the design of the subsystems of the machine
that was developed specifically for this task.
