Fully-automatic general-purpose high-quality machine translation systems
(FGH-MT) are extremely difficult to build. In fact, there is no system in the
world for any pair of languages which qualifies to be called FGH-MT. The
reasons are not far to seek. Translation is a creative process which involves
interpretation of the given text by the translator. Translation would also vary
depending on the audience and the purpose for which it is meant. This would
explain the difficulty of building a machine translation system. Since, the
machine is not capable of interpreting a general text with sufficient accuracy
automatically at present - let alone re-expressing it for a given audience, it
fails to perform as FGH-MT. FOOTNOTE{The major difficulty that the machine
faces in interpreting a given text is the lack of general world knowledge or
common sense knowledge.}
