This paper describes a new parallel kinematic architecture for machining
applications, namely, the orthoglide. This machine features three fixed
parallel linear joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile platform
which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The main
interest of the orthoglide is that it takes benefit from the advantages of the
popular PPP serial machines (regular Cartesian workspace shape and uniform
performances) as well as from the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links
(less inertia and better dynamic performances), which makes the orthoglide well
suited to high-speed machining applications. Possible extension of the
orthoglide to 5-axis machining is also investigated.
