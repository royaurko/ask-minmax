In-plane thermal conductivity of the thermoelectric layered cobalt oxides has
been measured using the Harman method, in which thermal conductivity is
obtained from temperature gradient induced by applied current. We have found
that the charge reservoir block (the block other than the CoO$_2$ block)
dominates the thermal conduction, where a nano-block integration concept is
effective for material design. We have further found that the thermal
conductivity shows a small but finite in-plane anisotropy between $a$ and $b$
axes, which can be ascribed to the misfit structure.
