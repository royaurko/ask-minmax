The CMS muon system includes in both the barrel and endcap region Resistive
Plate Chambers (RPC). They mainly serve as trigger detectors and also improve
the reconstruction of muon parameters. Over the years, the instantaneous
luminosity of the Large Hadron Collider gradually increases. During the LHC
Phase 1 (~first 10 years of operation) an ultimate luminosity is expected above
its design value of 10^34/cm^2/s at 14 TeV. To prepare the machine and also the
experiments for this, two long shutdown periods are scheduled for 2013-2014 and
2018-2019. The CMS Collaboration is planning several detector upgrades during
these long shutdowns. In particular, the muon detection system should be able
to maintain a low-pT threshold for an efficient Level-1 Muon Trigger at high
particle rates. One of the measures to ensure this, is to extend the present
RPC system with the addition of a 4th layer in both endcap regions. During the
first long shutdown, these two new stations will be equipped in the region
|eta|<1.6 with 144 High Pressure Laminate (HPL) double-gap RPCs operating in
avalanche mode, with a similar design as the existing CMS endcap chambers.
Here, we present the upgrade plans for the CMS RPC system for the fist long
shutdown, including trigger simulation studies for the extended system, and
details on the new HPL production, the chamber assembly and the quality control
procedures.
