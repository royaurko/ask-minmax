The software process model consists of a set of activities undertaken to
design, develop and maintain software systems. A variety of software process
models have been designed to structure, describe and prescribe the software
development process. The software process models play a very important role in
software development, so it forms the core of the software product. Software
project failure is often devastating to an organization. Schedule slips, buggy
releases and missing features can mean the end of the project or even financial
ruin for a company. Oddly, there is disagreement over what it means for a
project to fail. In this paper, discussion is done on current process models
and analysis on failure of software development, which shows the need of new
research.
