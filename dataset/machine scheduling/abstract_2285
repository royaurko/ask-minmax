We present BV and u'g'r'i' CCD photometry of the central region of NGC 2482.
We also present BVu'g' CCD photometry of five clusters that have been poorly
studied in the past: Ruprecht 42, Ruprecht 51, Ruprecht 153, Ruprecht 154; and
AH03 J0748-26.9, which to our knowledge has not been studied before. Using a
global optimization technique that eliminates much of the subjectivity
previously inherent in main sequence fitting studies, we obtain values of the
distances, ages, and metallicities of the clusters, with robust estimates of
the uncertainties of these fundamental parameters. Four of our clusters are
less than ~1.3 kpc beyond the Sun's distance from the Galactic Center and have
essentially solar metallicity. The metallicities of those clusters more distant
from the Galactic Center are consistent with a 0.3 dex step to lower [Fe/H]
found in other studies.
