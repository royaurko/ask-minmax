We present in this article a detailed quantitative discussion of the
measurement of the leptonic mixing angle theta_13 through currently scheduled
reactor neutrino oscillation experiments. We thus focus on Double Chooz (Phase
I & II), Daya Bay (Phase I & II) and RENO experiments. We perform a unified
analysis, including systematics, backgrounds and accurate experimental setup in
each case. Each identified systematic error and background impact has been
assessed on experimental setups following published data when available and
extrapolating from Double Chooz acquired knowledge otherwise. After reviewing
the experiments, we present a new analysis of their sensitivities to sin^2(2
theta_13) and study the impact of the different systematics based on the pulls
approach. Through this generic statistical analysis we discuss the advantages
and drawbacks of each experimental setup.
