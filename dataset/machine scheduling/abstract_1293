Multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) cellular systems with an
excess of base station (BS) antennas (Massive MIMO) offer unprecedented
multiplexing gains and radiated energy efficiency. Oscillator phase noise is
introduced in the transmitter and receiver radio frequency chains and severely
degrades the performance of communication systems. We study the effect of
oscillator phase noise in frequency-selective Massive MIMO systems with
imperfect channel state information (CSI). In particular, we consider two
distinct operation modes, namely when the phase noise processes at the $M$ BS
antennas are identical (synchronous operation) and when they are independent
(non-synchronous operation). We analyze a linear and low-complexity
time-reversal maximum-ratio combining (TR-MRC) reception strategy. For both
operation modes we derive a lower bound on the sum-capacity and we compare
their performance. Based on the derived achievable sum-rates, we show that with
the proposed receive processing an $O(\sqrt{M})$ array gain is achievable. Due
to the phase noise drift the estimated effective channel becomes progressively
outdated. Therefore, phase noise effectively limits the length of the interval
used for data transmission and the number of scheduled users. The derived
achievable rates provide insights into the optimum choice of the data interval
length and the number of scheduled users.
