We present a novel multivariate classification technique based on Genetic
Programming. The technique is distinct from Genetic Algorithms and offers
several advantages compared to Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The
technique optimizes a set of human-readable classifiers with respect to some
user-defined performance measure. We calculate the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
dimension of this class of learning machines and consider a practical example:
the search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson at the LHC. The resulting
classifier is very fast to evaluate, human-readable, and easily portable. The
