Astrometry is a powerful technique to study the populations of extrasolar
planets around nearby stars. It gives access to a unique parameter space and is
therefore required for obtaining a comprehensive picture of the properties,
abundances, and architectures of exoplanetary systems. In this review, we
discuss the scientific potential, present the available techniques and
instruments, and highlight a few results of astrometric planet searches, with
an emphasis on observations from the ground. In particular, we discuss
astrometric observations with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Interferometer and
a programme employing optical imaging with a VLT camera, both aimed at the
astrometric detection of exoplanets. Finally, we set these efforts into the
context of Gaia, ESA's astrometry mission scheduled for launch in 2013, and
present an outlook on the future of astrometric exoplanet detection from the
ground.
