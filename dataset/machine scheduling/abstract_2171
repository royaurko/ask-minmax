The SPIN@FERMI collaboration has updated its 1991-95 Reports on the
acceleration of polarized protons in Fermilab's Main Injector, which was
commissioned by Fermilab. This Updated Report summarizes some updated Physics
Goals for a 120-150 GeV/c polarized proton beam. It also contains an updated
discussion of the Modifications and Hardware needed for a polarized beam in the
Main Injector, along with an updated Schedule and Budget.
