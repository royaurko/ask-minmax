We have performed scanning capacitance microscopy using a relaxation
oscillator. Precision calibrations indicate a sensitivity on the order of 0.05
pF. Surface topography of metallic structures, such as machined grooves and
coins, can be readily obtained either in the constant-height (non-contact) or
tapping (contact) mode. Spatial resolution of sub-50 $\mu$m has been achieved.
