A Monte Carlo method for dynamics simulation of all-atom protein models is
introduced, to reach long times not accessible to conventional molecular
dynamics. The considered degrees of freedom are the dihedrals at
C$_\alpha$-atoms. Two Monte Carlo moves are used: single rotations about
torsion axes, and cooperative rotations in windows of amide planes, changing
the conformation globally and locally, respectively. For local moves Jacobians
are used to obtain an unbiased distribution of dihedrals. A molecular dynamics
energy function adapted to the protein model is employed. A polypeptide is
folded into native-like structures by local but not by global moves.
