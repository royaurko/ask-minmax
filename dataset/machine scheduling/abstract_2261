High power pulsed magnetron sputtering (HPPMS) plasmas are pulsed discharges
where the plasma composition as well as the fluxes and energies of ions are
changing during the pulse. The time resolved energy distribution for Ar$^{1+}$
ions was measured and Phase Resolved Optical Emission Spectroscopy (PROES) for
the Ar I line at 760 nm was done to get more insight in the transport
properties of the plasma forming noble gas. These measurements were performed
during HPPMS of titanium with argon at 0.5 Pa. The peak power density during
the 50 $\mu$s pulses was 1.8 kW/cm$^2$. In this contribution we demonstrate how
time resolved mass spectrometry and ICCD cameras can be used to shed more light
on energy and particle transport in HPPMS-plasmas.
