This paper shows the necessity of distinguishing different referential uses
of noun phrases in machine translation. We argue that differentiating between
the generic, referential and ascriptive uses of noun phrases is the minimum
necessary to generate articles and number correctly when translating from
Japanese to English. Heuristics for determining these differences are proposed
for a Japanese-to-English machine translation system. Finally the results of
using the proposed heuristics are shown to have raised the percentage of noun
phrases generated with correct use of articles and number in the
Japanese-to-English machine translation system ALT-J/E from 65% to 77%.
