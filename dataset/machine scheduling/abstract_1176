It has been recently suggested that in wireless networks, CSMA-based
distributed MAC algorithms could achieve optimal utility without any message
passing. We present the first proof of convergence of such adaptive CSMA
algorithms towards an arbitrarily tight approximation of utility-optimizing
schedule. We also briefly discuss the tradeoff between optimality at
equilibrium and short-term fairness practically achieved by such algorithms.
