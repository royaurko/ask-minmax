The strong, intermediate, and weak Turing impossibility properties are
introduced. Some facts concerning Turing impossibility for stack machine
programming are trivially adapted from previous work. Several intriguing
questions are raised about the Turing impossibility properties concerning
different method interfaces for stack machine programming.
