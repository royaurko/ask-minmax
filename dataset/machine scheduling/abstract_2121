This paper presents a methodology to efficiently explore the design space of
communication adapters. In most digital signal processing (DSP) applications,
the overall performance of the system is significantly affected by
communication architectures, as a consequence the designers need specifically
optimized adapters. By explicitly modeling these communications within an
effective graph-theoretic model and analysis framework, we automatically
generate an optimized architecture, named Space-Time AdapteR (STAR). Our design
flow inputs a C description of Input/Output data scheduling, and user
requirements (throughput, latency, parallelism...), and formalizes
communication constraints through a Resource Constraints Graph (RCG). Design
space exploration is then performed through associated tools, to synthesize a
STAR component under time-to-market constraints. The proposed approach has been
tested to design an industrial data mixing block example: an Ultra-Wideband
interleaver.
