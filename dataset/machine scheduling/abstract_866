We study one-head machines through symbolic and topological dynamics. In
particular, a subshift is associated to the subshift, and we are interested in
its complexity in terms of realtime recognition. We emphasize the class of
one-head machines whose subshift can be recognized by a deterministic pushdown
automaton. We prove that this class corresponds to particular restrictions on
the head movement, and to equicontinuity in associated dynamical systems.
