This paper considers peer-to-peer scheduling for a network with multiple
wireless devices. A subset of the devices are mobile users that desire specific
files. Each user may already have certain popular files in its cache. The
remaining devices are access points that typically have access to a larger set
of files. Users can download packets of their requested file from an access
point or from a nearby user. Our prior work optimizes peer scheduling in a
general setting, but the resulting delay can be large when applied to mobile
networks. This paper focuses on the mobile case, and develops a new algorithm
that reduces delay by opportunistically grabbing packets from current
neighbors. However, it treats a simpler model where each user desires a single
file with infinite length. An algorithm that provably optimizes throughput
utility while incentivizing participation is developed for this case. The
algorithm extends as a simple heuristic in more general cases with finite file
sizes and random active and idle periods.
