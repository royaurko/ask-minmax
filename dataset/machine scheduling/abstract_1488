Dense local descriptors and machine learning have been used with success in
several applications, like classification of textures, steganalysis, and
forgery detection. We develop a new image forgery detector building upon some
descriptors recently proposed in the steganalysis field suitably merging some
of such descriptors, and optimizing a SVM classifier on the available training
set. Despite the very good performance, very small forgeries are hardly ever
detected because they contribute very little to the descriptors. Therefore we
also develop a simple, but extremely specific, copy-move detector based on
region matching and fuse decisions so as to reduce the missing detection rate.
Overall results appear to be extremely encouraging.
