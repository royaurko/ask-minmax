Many applications in translational medicine require the understanding of how
diseases progress through the accumulation of persistent events. Specialized
Bayesian networks called monotonic progression networks offer a statistical
framework for modeling this sort of phenomenon. Current machine learning tools
to reconstruct Bayesian networks from data are powerful but not suited to
progression models. We combine the technological advances in machine learning
with a rigorous philosophical theory of causation to produce Polaris, a
scalable algorithm for learning progression networks that accounts for causal
or biological noise as well as logical relations among genetic events, making
the resulting models easy to interpret qualitatively. We tested Polaris on
synthetically generated data and showed that it outperforms a widely used
machine learning algorithm and approaches the performance of the competing
special-purpose, albeit clairvoyant algorithm that is given a priori
information about the model parameters. We also prove that under certain rather
mild conditions, Polaris is guaranteed to converge for sufficiently large
sample sizes. Finally, we applied Polaris to point mutation and copy number
variation data in Prostate cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and found
that there are likely three distinct progressions, one major androgen driven
progression, one major non-androgen driven progression, and one novel minor
androgen driven progression.
