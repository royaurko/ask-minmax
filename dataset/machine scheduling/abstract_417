We consider nano-sized artificial or biological machines working in steady
state enforced by imposing non-equilibrium concentrations of solutes or by
applying external forces, torques or electric fields. For unicyclic and
strongly coupled multicyclic machines, efficiency at maximum power is not
bounded by the linear response value 1/2. For strong driving, it can even
approach the thermodynamic limit 1. Quite generally, such machines fall in
three different classes characterized, respectively, as "strong and efficient",
"strong and inefficient", and "balanced". For weakly coupled multicyclic
machines, efficiency at maximum power has lost any universality even in the
linear response regime.
