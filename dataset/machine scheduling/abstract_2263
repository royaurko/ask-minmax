Network traffic model is a critical problem for urban applications, mainly
because of its diversity and node density. As wireless sensor network is highly
concerned with the development of smart cities, careful consideration to
traffic model helps choose appropriate protocols and adapt network parameters
to reach best performances on energy-latency tradeoffs. In this paper, we
compare the performance of two off-the-shelf medium access control protocols on
two different kinds of traffic models, and then evaluate their application-end
information delay and energy consumption while varying traffic parameters and
network density. From the simulation results, we highlight some limits induced
by network density and occurrence frequency of event-driven applications. When
it comes to realtime urban services, a protocol selection shall be taken into
account - even dynamically - with a special attention to energy-delay tradeoff.
To this end, we provide several insights on parking sensor networks.
