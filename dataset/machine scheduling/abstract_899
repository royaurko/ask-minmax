We develop an approach for feature elimination in empirical risk minimization
and support vector machines, based on recursive elimination of features. We
present theoretical properties of this method and show that this is uniformly
consistent in finding the correct feature space under certain generalized
assumptions. We present case studies to show that the assumptions are met in
most practical situations and also present simulation studies to demonstrate
performance of the proposed approach.
