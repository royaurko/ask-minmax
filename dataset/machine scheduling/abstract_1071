Conditional restricted Boltzmann machines are undirected stochastic neural
networks with a layer of input and output units connected bipartitely to a
layer of hidden units. These networks define models of conditional probability
distributions on the states of the output units given the states of the input
units, parametrized by interaction weights and biases. We address the
representational power of these models, proving results their ability to
represent conditional Markov random fields and conditional distributions with
restricted supports, the minimal size of universal approximators, the maximal
model approximation errors, and on the dimension of the set of representable
conditional distributions. We contribute new tools for investigating
conditional probability models, which allow us to improve the results that can
be derived from existing work on restricted Boltzmann machine probability
models.
