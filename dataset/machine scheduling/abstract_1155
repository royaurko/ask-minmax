The present theoretical knowledge about photons and hard photoproduction
processes, i.e. the production of jets, light and heavy hadrons, quarkonia, and
prompt photons in photon-photon and photon-hadron collisions, is reviewed.
Virtual and polarized photons and prompt photon production in hadron collisions
are also discussed. The most important leading and next-to-leading order QCD
results are compiled in analytic form. A large variety of numerical predictions
is compared to data from TRISTAN, LEP, and HERA and extended to future electron
and muon colliders. The sources of all relevant results are collected in a rich
bibliography.
