Algorithms for simulating complex physical systems or solving difficult
optimization problems often resort to an annealing process. Rather than
simulating the system at the temperature of interest, an annealing algorithm
starts at a temperature that is high enough to ensure ergodicity and gradually
decreases it until the destination temperature is reached. This idea is used in
popular algorithms such as parallel tempering and simulated annealing. A
general problem with annealing methods is that they require a temperature
schedule. Choosing well-balanced temperature schedules can be tedious and
time-consuming. Imbalanced schedules can have a negative impact on the
convergence, runtime and success of annealing algorithms. This article outlines
a unifying framework, ensemble annealing, that combines ideas from simulated
annealing, histogram reweighting and nested sampling with concepts in
thermodynamic control. Ensemble annealing simultaneously simulates a physical
system and estimates its density of states. The temperatures are lowered not
according to a prefixed schedule but adaptively so as to maintain a constant
relative entropy between successive ensembles. After each step on the
temperature ladder an estimate of the density of states is updated and a new
temperature is chosen. Ensemble annealing is highly practical and broadly
applicable. This is illustrated for various systems including Ising, Potts, and
protein models.
