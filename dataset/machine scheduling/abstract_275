The paper considers a problem of consensus-based synchronization of uncertain
parameter varying multi-agent systems. We present a method for constructing
consensus-based synchronization protocol schedules for each agent to ensure it
synchronizes with a reference parameter-varying system. The proposed protocol
guarantees a specified level of $H_\infty$ transient consensus between the
agents. The algorithm uses a consensus-preserving interpolation and produces
continuous (in the scheduling parameter) coefficients for the protocol. An
application to synchronization of uncertain bilinear systems is discussed.
