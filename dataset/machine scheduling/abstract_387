Finite state machines are widely used as a sound mathematical formalism that
appropriately describes large scale, distributed and complex systems. Multiple
interactions of finite state machines in complex systems are well captured by
the notion of non-flat systems. Non--flat systems are "finite state machines"
where each "state" can be either a basic state or an aggregate of finite state
machines. By expanding a non-flat system, a flat system is obtained which is an
ordinary finite state machine. In this paper we introduce a novel class of
non--flat systems called Arena of Finite State Machines (AFSM). AFSMs are
collections of finite state machines that interact concurrently through a
communication network. We propose a notion of compositional bisimulation that
allows checking bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs by directly exploiting their
communication networks and hence, without the need of expanding the AFSMs to
finite state machines. Compositional bisimulation allows a computational
complexity reduction when checking bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs, as
formally quantified in the paper. An application of the proposed framework to
the regulation of gene expression in the bacterium Escherichia coli is also
presented.
