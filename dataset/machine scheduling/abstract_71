A Web service is a software system designed to support interoperable
machine-to-machine interaction over a network. Web services provide a standard
means of interoperating between different software applications, running on a
variety of platforms and/or frameworks. One of the main advantages of the usage
of web services is its ability to integrate with the other services through web
service composition and realize the required functionality. This paper presents
a new paradigm of dynamic web services composition using network analysis
paired with backtracking. An algorithm called "Zeittafel" for the selection and
scheduling of services that are to be composed is also presented. With the
proposed system better percentage of job success rate is obtained compared to
the existing methodology.
