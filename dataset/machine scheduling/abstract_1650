In this paper we consider the time and the crossing sequence complexities of
one-tape off-line Turing machines. We show that the running time of each
nondeterministic machine accepting a nonregular language must grow at least as
n\log n, in the case all accepting computations are considered (accept
measure). We also prove that the maximal length of the crossing sequences used
in accepting computations must grow at least as \log n. On the other hand, it
is known that if the time is measured considering, for each accepted string,
only the faster accepting computation (weak measure), then there exist
nonregular languages accepted in linear time. We prove that under this measure,
each accepting computation should exhibit a crossing sequence of length at
least \log\log n. We also present efficient implementations of algorithms
accepting some unary nonregular languages.
