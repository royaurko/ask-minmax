We study multitoken interaction machines in the context of a very expressive
logical system with exponentials, fixpoints and synchronization. The advantage
of such machines is to provide models in the style of the Geometry of
Interaction, i.e., an interactive semantics which is close to low-level
implementation. On the one hand, we prove that despite the inherent complexity
of the framework, interaction is guaranteed to be deadlock free. On the other
hand, the resulting logical system is powerful enough to embed PCF and to
adequately model its behaviour, both when call-by-name and when call-by-value
evaluation are considered. This is not the case for single-token stateless
interactive machines.
