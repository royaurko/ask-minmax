The Joint Milliarcsecond Pathfinder Survey (JMAPS) is a Department of Navy
bright star astrometric all-sky survey scheduled for launch in the 2012
timeframe. Mission objectives include a complete update of star positions for
the 2015 epoch to accuracy levels of 1 milliarcsecond (5 nano-radians) for
bright stars, as well as demonstration of 10 milliarcsecond attitude
determination capability and 50 milli-arcsecond attitude control on-orbit. In
the following paper, we describe the general instrument design and expected
performance. We also discuss the new mission capabilities enabled by the
unprecedented attitude determination accuracy of such an instrument, and focus
specifically on the application to long distance (50,000-100,00 km) formation
flying and solar system navigation.
