This paper targets the unexplored problem of demand response within the
context of power-grids that are allowed to regularly enforce blackouts as a
mean to balance supply with demand:highly-stressed grids. Currently these
utilities use as a cyclic and binary (power/no-power) schedule over consumer
groups leading to significant wastage of capacity and long hours of no-power.
We present here a novel building DLC system, Aashiyana, that can enforce
several user-defined low-power states. We evaluate distributed and centralized
load-shedding schemes using Aashiyana that can, compared to current
load-shedding strategy, reduce the number of homes with no power by 80% for
minor change in the fraction of homes with full-power.
