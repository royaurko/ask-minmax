Approximate Message Passing (AMP) has been shown to be an excellent
statistical approach to signal inference and compressed sensing problem. The
AMP framework provides modularity in the choice of signal prior; here we
propose a hierarchical form of the Gauss-Bernouilli prior which utilizes a
Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) trained on the signal support to push
reconstruction performance beyond that of simple iid priors for signals whose
support can be well represented by a trained binary RBM. We present and analyze
two methods of RBM factorization and demonstrate how these affect signal
reconstruction performance within our proposed algorithm. Finally, using the
MNIST handwritten digit dataset, we show experimentally that using an RBM
allows AMP to approach oracle-support performance.
