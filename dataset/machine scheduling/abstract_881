We take an existing implementation of an algorithm for the maximum clique
problem and modify it so that we can distribute it over an ad-hoc cluster of
machines. Our goal was to achieve a significant speedup in performance with
minimal development effort, i.e. a maximum costup. We present a simple
modification to a state-of-the-art exact algorithm for maximum clique that
allows us to distribute it across many machines. An empirical study over large
hard benchmarks shows that speedups of an order of magnitude are routine for 25
or more machines.
