Photographs show distinct differences between positive streamers in air or in
a nitrogen-oxygen mixture (0.2% O2). The streamers in the mixture branch more
frequently, but the branches also extinguish more easily. Probably related to
that, the streamers in the mixture propagate more in a zigzag manner while they
are straighter in air. Furthermore, streamers in the mixture can become longer;
they are thinner and more intense.
