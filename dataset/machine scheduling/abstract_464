Green communication attracts increasing research interest recently. Equipped
with a rechargeable battery, a source node can harvest energy from ambient
environments and rely on this free and regenerative energy supply to transmit
packets. Due to the uncertainty of available energy from harvesting, however,
intolerably large latency and packet loss could be induced, if the source
always waits for harvested energy. To overcome this problem, one Reliable
Energy Source (RES) can be resorted to for a prompt delivery of backlogged
packets. Naturally, there exists a tradeoff between the packet delivery delay
and power consumption from the RES. In this paper, we address the delay optimal
scheduling problem for a bursty communication link powered by a
capacity-limited battery storing harvested energy together with one RES. The
proposed scheduling scheme gives priority to the usage of harvested energy, and
resorts to the RES when necessary based on the data and energy queueing
processes, with an average power constraint from the RES. Through
twodimensional Markov chain modeling and linear programming formulation, we
derive the optimal threshold-based scheduling policy together with the
corresponding transmission parameters. Our study includes three exemplary cases
that capture some important relations between the data packet arrival process
and energy harvesting capability. Our theoretical analysis is corroborated by
simulation results.
