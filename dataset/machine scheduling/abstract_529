This paper develops the time-delay approach to Networked Control Systems
(NCSs) in the presence of variable transmission delays, sampling intervals and
communication constraints. The system sensor nodes are supposed to be
distributed over a network. Due to communication constraints only one node
output is transmitted through the communication channel at once. The scheduling
of sensor information towards the controller is ruled by a weighted
Try-Once-Discard (TOD) or by Round-Robin (RR) protocols. Differently from the
existing results on NCSs in the presence of scheduling protocols (in the
frameworks of hybrid and discrete-time systems), we allow the communication
delays to be greater than the sampling intervals. A novel hybrid system model
for the closed-loop system is presented that contains {\it time-varying delays
in the continuous dynamics and in the reset conditions}. A new
Lyapunov-Krasovskii method, which is based on discontinuous in time Lyapunov
functionals is introduced for the stability analysis of the delayed hybrid
systems. Polytopic type uncertainties in the system model can be easily
included in the analysis. The efficiency of the time-delay approach is
illustrated on the examples of uncertain cart-pendulum and of batch reactor.
