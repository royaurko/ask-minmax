MICROSCOPE is a French Space Agency mission that aims to test the Weak
Equivalence Principle in space down to an accuracy of $10^{-15}$. This is two
orders of magnitude better than the current constraints, which will allow us to
test General Relativity as well as theories beyond General Relativity which
predict a possible Weak Equivalence Principle violation below $10^{-13}$. In
this communication, we describe the MICROSCOPE mission, its measurement
principle and instrument, and we give an update on its status. After a
successful instrument's commissioning, MICROSCOPE is on track for on-schedule
launch, expected in 2016.
