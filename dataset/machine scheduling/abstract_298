We study time scheduling problems with allowed absences. One may think on a
sport tournament where each player (each team) is permitted a certain number
$t$ of absences. We then examine how many rounds are needed to schedule the
whole tournament in the worst case. Clearly, this upper limit depends on $t$
and on the structure of the graph $G$ whose edges represent the games that have
to be played. However, it also depends on whether or not the absences are
announced before the tournament starts. Therefore, we actually have two upper
limits for the number of required rounds. We have $\chi^t(G)$ for
pre-scheduling, if all absences are prefixed, and we have
$\chi_{\textit{OL}}^t(G)$ for on-line scheduling, if we have to stay flexible
and deal with absences when they occur. We conjecture that
$\chi^t(G)=\Delta(G)+2t$ and that $\chi_{\textit{OL}}^t(G)=\chi'(G)+2t.$ The
first conjecture is stronger than the Total Coloring Conjecture, while the
second is weaker than the On-Line List Edge Coloring Conjecture. Our
conjectures hold for all bipartite graphs. For complete graphs, we prove them
partially. Here, explicit scheduling schemes and connections to symmetric Latin
squares with prescribed diagonal are involved. Lower and upper bounds to
$\chi^t(G)$ and $\chi_{\textit{OL}}^t(G)$ for general multi-graphs $G$ are
established, too.
