The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) is a NASA astronomy mission
that will explore the 905-1187 A wavelength region at high spectral resolution.
Funded by NASA's Explorer Program, this Origins mission is scheduled for a 1999
launch and at least three years of operations. The development of FUSE is being
led by the Johns Hopkins University, with major contributions to the program
from the University of Colorado, the University of California-Berkeley, the
space agencies of Canada and France, and corporate partners.
  FUSE will have approximately 10,000 times the sensitivity of its pioneering
predecessor, Copernicus, which operated in the 1970s. Much of the FUSE Science
Team observing time will be dedicated to studying the interstellar medium of
the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. Observations of high velocity clouds play
an important role in the FUSE program. In this paper, I outline some of the
FUSE Science Team plans for observing HVCs. Simple absorption line models are
also provided for investigators seeking to identify atomic and molecular
species in this wavelength region.
