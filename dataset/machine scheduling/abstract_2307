The current Cloud infrastructure services (IaaS) market employs a
resource-based selling model: customers rent nodes from the provider and pay
per-node per-unit-time. This selling model places the burden upon customers to
predict their job resource requirements and durations. Inaccurate prediction by
customers can result in over-provisioning of resources, or under-provisioning
and poor job performance. Thanks to improved resource virtualization and
multi-tenant performance isolation, as well as common frameworks for batch
jobs, such as MapReduce, Cloud providers can predict job completion times more
accurately. We offer a new definition of QoS-levels in terms of job completion
times and we present a new QoS-based selling mechanism for batch jobs in a
multi-tenant OpenStack cluster. Our experiments show that the QoS-based
solution yields up to 40% improvement over the revenue of more standard selling
mechanisms based on a fixed per-node price across various demand and supply
conditions in a 240-VCPU OpenStack cluster.
