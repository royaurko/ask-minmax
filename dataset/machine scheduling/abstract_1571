An instance-weighted variant of the support vector machine (SVM) has
attracted considerable attention recently since they are useful in various
machine learning tasks such as non-stationary data analysis, heteroscedastic
data modeling, transfer learning, learning to rank, and transduction. An
important challenge in these scenarios is to overcome the computational
bottleneck---instance weights often change dynamically or adaptively, and thus
the weighted SVM solutions must be repeatedly computed. In this paper, we
develop an algorithm that can efficiently and exactly update the weighted SVM
solutions for arbitrary change of instance weights. Technically, this
contribution can be regarded as an extension of the conventional solution-path
algorithm for a single regularization parameter to multiple instance-weight
parameters. However, this extension gives rise to a significant problem that
breakpoints (at which the solution path turns) have to be identified in
high-dimensional space. To facilitate this, we introduce a parametric
representation of instance weights. We also provide a geometric interpretation
in weight space using a notion of critical region: a polyhedron in which the
current affine solution remains to be optimal. Then we find breakpoints at
intersections of the solution path and boundaries of polyhedrons. Through
extensive experiments on various practical applications, we demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed algorithm.
