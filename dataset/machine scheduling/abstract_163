This paper will provide a method to decompose forging dies for machining
planning in the case of high speed machining finishing operations. This method
lies on a machining feature approach model presented in the following paper.
The two main decomposition phases, called Basic Machining Features Extraction
and Process Planning Generation, are presented. These two decomposition phases
integrates machining resources models and expert machining knowledge to provide
an outstanding process planning.
