We consider online scheduling on multiple machines for jobs arriving
one-by-one with the objective of minimizing the makespan. For any number of
identical parallel or uniformly related machines, we provide a
competitive-ratio approximation scheme that computes an online algorithm whose
competitive ratio is arbitrarily close to the best possible competitive ratio.
We also determine this value up to any desired accuracy. This is the first
application of competitive-ratio approximation schemes in the online-list
model. The result proves the applicability of the concept in different online
models. We expect that it fosters further research on other online problems.
