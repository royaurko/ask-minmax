Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm is a preemptive scheduling algorithm.
It is designed especially for time sharing Operating System (OS). In RR
scheduling algorithm the CPU switches between the processes when the static
Time Quantum (TQ) expires. RR scheduling algorithm is considered as the most
widely used scheduling algorithm in research because the TQ is equally shared
among the processes. In this paper a newly proposed variant of RR algorithm
called Min-Max Round Robin (MMRR) scheduling algorithm is presented. The idea
of this MMRR is to make the TQ repeatedly adjusted using Min-Max dispersion
measure in accordance with remaining CPU burst time. Our experimental analysis
shows that MMRR performs much better than RR algorithm in terms of average
turnaround time, average waiting time and number of context switches.
