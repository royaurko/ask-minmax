In this paper we present applications of different machine learning
algorithms in aquaculture. Machine learning algorithms learn models from
historical data. In aquaculture historical data are obtained from farm
practices, yields, and environmental data sources. Associations between these
different variables can be obtained by applying machine learning algorithms to
historical data. In this paper we present applications of different machine
learning algorithms in aquaculture applications.
