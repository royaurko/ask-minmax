For radiation protection and environmental impact assessment purpose, the
radioactivity induced by carbon ion of Heavy Ion Medical Machine (HIMM) was
studied. Radionuclides in accelerator component, cooling water and air at
target area which are induced from primary beam and secondary particles are
simulated by FLUKA Monte Carlo code. It is found that radioactivity in cooling
water and air is not very important at the required beam intensity and energy
which is needed for treatment, radionuclides in accelerator component may cause
some problem for maintenance work, suitable cooling time is needed after the
machine are shut down.
