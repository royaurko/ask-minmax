We present the program Temanejo, a debugger for task based parallelisation
models such as StarSs. The challenge in debugging StarSs applications lies in
the fact that tasks are scheduled at runtime, i.e dynamically in accordance to
the data dependencies between them. Our tool assists the programmer in the
debugging process by visualising the task dependency graph and allowing to
control the scheduling of tasks. The toolset consists of the library Ayudame
which communicates with the StarSs runtime on one side and of the debugger
Temanejo on the other side which communicates with Ayudame. Temanejo provides a
graphical user interface with which the application can be analysed and
controlled.
