Cloud computing revolutionised the industry with its elastic, on-demand
approach to computational resources, but has lead to a tremendous impact on the
environment. Data centers constitute 1.1-1.5% of total electricity usage in the
world. Taking a more informed view of the electrical grid by analysing
real-time electricity prices, we set the foundations of a grid-conscious cloud.
We propose a scheduling algorithm that predicts electricity price peaks and
throttles energy consumption by pausing virtual machines. We evaluate the
approach on the OpenStack cloud manager through an empirical approach and show
reductions in energy consumption and costs. Finally, we define green instances
in which cloud providers can offer such services to their customers under
better pricing options.
