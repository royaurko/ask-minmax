The paper proposes a solution for the Grid scheduling problem, addressing in
particular the requirement of high performance an efficient algorithm must
fulfill. Advance Reservation engages a distributed, dynamic, fault-tolerant and
efficient strategy which reserves resources for future task execution. The
paper presents the main features of the strategy, the functioning mechanism the
strategy is based on and the methods used for evaluating the algorithm.
