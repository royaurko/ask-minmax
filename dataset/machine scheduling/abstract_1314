We propose pilot reuse (PR) in single cell for massive multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission to reduce the pilot
overhead. For spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels, we establish a
relationship between channel spatial correlations and channel power angle
spectrum when the base station antenna number tends to infinity. With this
channel model, we show that sum mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation
can be minimized provided that channel angle of arrival intervals of the user
terminals reusing the pilots are non-overlapping, which shows feasibility of PR
over spatially correlated massive MIMO channels with constrained channel
angular spreads. Regarding that channel estimation performance might degrade
due to PR, we also develop the closed-form robust multiuser uplink receiver and
downlink precoder that minimize sum MSE of signal detection, and reveal a
duality between them. Subsequently, we investigate pilot scheduling, which
determines the PR pattern, under two minimum MSE related criteria, and propose
a low complexity pilot scheduling algorithm which relies on the channel
statistics only. Simulation results show that the proposed PR scheme provides
significant performance gains over the conventional orthogonal training scheme
in terms of net spectral efficiency.
