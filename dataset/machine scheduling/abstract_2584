We show that probabilistic computable functions, i.e., those functions
outputting distributions and computed by probabilistic Turing machines, can be
characterized by a natural generalization of Church and Kleene's partial
recursive functions. The obtained algebra, following Leivant, can be restricted
so as to capture the notion of polytime sampleable distributions, a key concept
in average-case complexity and cryptography.
