There now exists preliminary experimental evidence for some fractions, such
as $\nu$ = 4/11 and 5/13, that do not belong to any of the sequences
$\nu=n/(2pn\pm 1)$, $p$ and $n$ being integers. We propose that these states
are mixed states of composite fermions of different flavors, for example,
composite fermions carrying two and four vortices. We also obtain an estimate
of the lowest-excitation dispersion curve as well as the transport gap; the
gaps for 4/11 are smaller than those for 1/3 by approximately a factor of 50.
