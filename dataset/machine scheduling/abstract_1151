In this paper we study the impact of the processing order of nodes of a
bipartite graph, on the performance of an iterative message-passing decoding.
To this end, we introduce the concept of neighborhood reliabilities of graph's
nodes. Nodes reliabilities are calculated at each iteration and then are used
to obtain a processing order within a serial or serial/parallel scheduling. The
basic idea is that by processing first the most reliable data, the decoder is
reinforced before processing the less reliable one. Using neighborhood
reliabilities, the Min-Sum decoder of LDPC codes approaches the performance of
the Sum-Product decoder.
