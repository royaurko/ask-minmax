In this technical report we describe describe the Domain Specific Language
(DSL) of the Workflow Execution Execution (WEE). Instead of interpreting an XML
based workflow description language like BPEL, the WEE uses a minimized but
expressive set of statements that runs directly on to of a virtual machine that
supports the Ruby language.Frameworks/Virtual Machines supporting supporting
this language include Java, .NET and there exists also a standalone Virtual
Machine. Using a DSL gives us the advantage of maintaining a very compact code
base of under 400 lines of code, as the host programming language implements
all the concepts like parallelism, threads, checking for syntactic correctness.
The implementation just hooks into existing statements to keep track of the
workflow and deliver information about current existing context variables and
state to the environment that embeds WEE.
