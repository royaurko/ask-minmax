Statistical machine learning methods are increasingly used for neuroimaging
data analysis. Their main virtue is their ability to model high-dimensional
datasets, e.g. multivariate analysis of activation images or resting-state time
series. Supervised learning is typically used in decoding or encoding settings
to relate brain images to behavioral or clinical observations, while
unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures in sets of images (e.g.
resting state functional MRI) or find sub-populations in large cohorts. By
considering different functional neuroimaging applications, we illustrate how
scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, can be used to perform some
key analysis steps. Scikit-learn contains a very large set of statistical
learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised, and its application to
neuroimaging data provides a versatile tool to study the brain.
