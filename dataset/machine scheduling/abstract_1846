Structural properties posses valuable information about the formation and
evolution of galaxies, and are important for understanding the past, present,
and future universe. Here we use unsupervised machine learning methodology to
analyze a network of similarities between galaxy morphological types, and
automatically deduce a morphological sequence of galaxies. Application of the
method to the EFIGI catalog show that the morphological scheme produced by the
algorithm is largely in agreement with the De Vaucouleurs system, demonstrating
the ability of computer vision and machine learning methods to automatically
profile galaxy morphological sequences. The unsupervised analysis method is
based on comprehensive computer vision techniques that compute the visual
similarities between the different morphological types. Rather than relying on
human cognition, the proposed system deduces the similarities between sets of
galaxy images in an automatic manner, and is therefore not limited by the
number of galaxies being analyzed. The source code of the method is publicly
available, and the protocol of the experiment is included in the paper so that
the experiment can be replicated, and the method can be used to analyze
user-defined datasets of galaxy images.
