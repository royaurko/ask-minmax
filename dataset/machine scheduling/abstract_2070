Energy efficient real-time task scheduling attracted a lot of attention in
the past decade. Most of the time, deterministic execution lengths for tasks
were considered, but this model fits less and less with the reality, especially
with the increasing number of multimedia applications. It's why a lot of
research is starting to consider stochastic models, where execution times are
only known stochastically. However, contributors consider that they have a pretty
much precise knowledge about the properties of the system, especially regarding
to the worst case execution time (or worst case execution cycles, WCEC).
  In this work, we try to relax this hypothesis, and assume that the WCEC can
vary. We propose miscellaneous methods to react to such a situation, and give
many simulation results attesting that with a small effort, we can provide very
good results, allowing to keep a low deadline miss rate as well as an energy
consumption similar to clairvoyant algorithms.
