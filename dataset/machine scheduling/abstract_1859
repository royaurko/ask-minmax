Associating distinct groups of objects (clusters) with contiguous regions of
high probability density (high-density clusters), is a central assumption in
statistical and machine learning approaches for the classification of
unlabelled data. In unsupervised classification this cluster definition
underlies a nonparametric approach known as density clustering. In
semi-supervised classification, class boundaries are assumed to lie in regions
of low density, which is equivalent to assuming that high-density clusters are
associated with a single class. We propose a novel hyperplane classifier for
unlabelled data that avoids splitting high-density clusters. The minimum
density hyperplane minimises the integral of the empirical probability density
function along a hyperplane. The link between this approach and density
clustering is immediate. We are able to establish a link between the minimum
density and the maximum margin hyperplanes, thus linking this approach to
maximum margin clustering and semi-supervised support vector machine
classifiers. We propose a globally convergent algorithm for the estimation of
minimum density hyperplanes for unsupervised and semi-supervised
classification. The performance of the proposed approach for unsupervised and
semi-supervised classification is evaluated on a number of benchmark datasets
and is shown to be very promising.
