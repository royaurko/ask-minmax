Warnings have been raised about the steady diminution of privacy. More and
more personal information, such as that contained electronic mail, is moving to
cloud computing servers where it might be machine-searched and indexed.
FauxCrypt is an algorithm for modification of a plaintext document that leaves
it generally readable by a person but not readily searched or indexed by
machine. The algorithm employs a dictionary substitution of selected words, and
an obfuscating transposition of letters in other words. The obfuscation is
designed to leave the words understandable, although they are badly spelled.
FauxCrypt is free, open source software, with source code available.
