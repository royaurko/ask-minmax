Designing and implementing an intelligent and user friendly human machine
interface for any kind of software or hardware oriented application is always
be a challenging task for the designers and developers because it is very
difficult to understand the psychology of the user, nature of the work and best
suit of the environment. This research paper is basically about to propose an
intelligent, flexible and user friendly machine interface for Product Life
Cycle Management products or PDM Systems since studies show that usability and
human computer interaction issues are a major cause of acceptance problems
introducing or using such systems. Going into details of the proposition, we
present prototype implementations about theme based on design requirements,
designed designs and technologies involved for the development of human machine
interface.
