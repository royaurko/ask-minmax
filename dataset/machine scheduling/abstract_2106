In June 2008 we performed a search for the 4He-eta bound state by measuring
the excitation function of the dd to 3He p pi- reaction near the eta production
threshold using the WASA-at-COSY detector. During the experimental run the
momentum of the deuteron beam was varied continuously within each acceleration
cycle from 2.185 GeV/c to 2.400 GeV/c, crossing the kinematic threshold for the
eta production in the dd to 4He eta reaction at 2.336 GeV/c. The preliminary
excitation function indicates no structure in the angular range close to the
180 degree where the signal is expected. The preliminary estimation of the
upper limit for the eta-mesic production via the dd to (eta 4He)b.s. to 3He p
pi- reaction is equal to about 20 nb on a one sigma level. A two-week
measurement with WASA-at-COSY for the dd 3He p pi- channel is scheduled for
November 2010. After two weeks of measurement with a luminosity of 4 * 10^(30)
cm^(-2) s^(-1), we expect a statistical sensitivity of a few nb sigma.
