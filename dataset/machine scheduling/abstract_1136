A cellular automata model is proposed to analyze the progress of Citrus
Variegated Chlorosis epidemics in S\~ao Paulo oranges plantation. In this model
epidemiological and environmental features, such as motility of sharpshooter
vectors which perform L\'evy flights, hydric and nutritional level of plant
stress and seasonal climatic effects, are included. The observed epidemics data
were quantitatively reproduced by the proposed model varying the parameters
controlling vectors motility, plant stress and initial population of diseased
plants.
