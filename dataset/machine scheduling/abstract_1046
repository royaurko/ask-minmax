We have recently carried out a computational campaign to investigate a model
of coronal heating in three-dimensions using reduced magnetohydrodynamics
(RMHD). Our code is built on a conventional scheme using the pseudo-spectral
method, and is parallelized using MPI. The current investigation requires very
long time integrations using high Lundquist numbers, where the formation of
very fine current layers challenge the resolutions achievable even on massively
parallel machines. We present here results of a port to Nvidia CUDA (Compute
Unified Device Architecture) for hardware acceleration using graphics
processing units (GPUs). In addition to a brief discussion of our general
strategy, we will report code performance on several machines which span a
variety of hardware configurations and capabilities. These include a desktop
workstation with commodity hardware, a dedicated research workstation equipped
with four Nvidia C2050 GPUs, as well as several large-scale GPU accelerated
distributed memory machines: Lincoln/NCSA, Dirac/NERSC, and Keeneland/NICS.
