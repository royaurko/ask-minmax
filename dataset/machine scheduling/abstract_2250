This paper analyzes the impact of production forecast errors on the expansion
planning of a power system and investigates the influence of market design to
facilitate the integration of renewable generation. For this purpose, we
propose a stochastic programming modeling framework to determine the expansion
plan that minimizes system-wide investment and operating costs, while ensuring
a given share of renewable generation in the electricity supply. Unlike
existing ones, this framework includes both a day-ahead and a balancing market
so as to capture the impact of both production forecasts and the associated
prediction errors. Within this framework, we consider two paradigmatic market
designs that essentially differ in whether the day-ahead generation schedule
and the subsequent balancing re-dispatch are co-optimized or not. The main
features and results of the model set-ups are discussed using an illustrative
four-node example and a more realistic 24-node case study.
