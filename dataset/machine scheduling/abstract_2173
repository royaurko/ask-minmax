Fluorescence correlation and cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCS, FCCS) are
widely used techniques to study the diffusion properties and interactions of
fluorescent molecules. Autocorrelation (ACFs) and cross-correlation functions
(CCFs) are typically acquired with fast hardware correlators. Here we introduce
a new multiple-{\tau} hardware correlator design for computing ACFs and CCFs in
real time. A scheduling algorithm minimizes the use of hardware resources by
calculating the different segments of the correlation function on a single
correlator block. The program was written in LabVIEW, enabling computation of
two multiple-{\tau} ACFs and two CCFs on a National Instruments FPGA card (NI
7833R) in real time with a minimal sampling time of 400 ns. Raw data are also
stored with a time resolution of 50 ns for later analysis. The design can be
adapted to other FPGA cards with only minor changes and extended to evaluate
more inputs and correlation functions.
