To reduce the implementation complexity of a belief propagation (BP) based
low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoder, shuffled BP decoding schedules, which
serialize the decoding process by dividing a complete parallel message-passing
iteration into a sequence of sub-iterations, have been proposed. The so-called
group horizontal shuffled BP algorithm partitions the check nodes of the code
graph into groups to perform group-by-group message-passing decoding. This
paper proposes a new grouping technique to accelerate the message-passing rate.
Performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed by a Gaussian approximation
approach. Both analysis and numerical experiments verify that the new algorithm
does yield a convergence rate faster than that of existing conventional or
group shuffled BP decoder with the same computing complexity constraint.
