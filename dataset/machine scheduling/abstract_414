Thin liquid films with floating active protein machines are considered.
Cyclic mechanical motions within the machines, representing microscopic
swimmers, lead to molecular propulsion forces applied to the air-liquid
interface. We show that, when the rate of energy supply to the machines exceeds
a threshold, the flat interface becomes linearly unstable. As the result of
this instability, the regime of interface turbulence, characterized by
irregular traveling waves and propagating machine clusters, is established.
Numerical investigations of this nonlinear regime are performed. Conditions for
the experimental observation of the instability are discussed.
