Gamma-ray astrophysics depends in many ways on multiwavelength studies. The
Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) Large Area Telescope (LAT)
Collaboration has started multiwavelength planning well before the scheduled
2007 launch of the observatory. Some of the high-priority multiwavelength needs
include: (1) availability of contemporaneous radio and X-ray timing of pulsars;
(2) expansion of blazar catalogs, including redshift measurements; (3) improved
observations of molecular clouds, especially at high galactic latitudes; (4)
simultaneous broad-band blazar monitoring; (5) characterization of gamma-ray
transients, including gamma ray bursts; (6) radio, optical, X-ray and TeV
counterpart searches for reliable and effective sources identification and
characterization. Several of these activities are needed to be in place before
launch.
