This paper addresses web object size which is one of important performance
measures and affects to service time in multiple access environment. Since
packets arrive according to Poission distribution and web service time has
arbitrary distribution, M/G/1 model can be used to describe the behavior of the
web server system. In the time division multiplexing (TDM), we can use M/D/1
with vacations model, because service time is constant and server may have a
vacation. We derive the mean web object size satisfying the constraint such
that mean waiting time by round-robin scheduling in multiple access environment
is equal to the mean queueing delay of M/D/1 with vacations model in TDM and
M/H2/1 model, respectively. Performance evaluation shows that the mean web
object size increases as the link utilization increases at the given maximum
segment size (MSS), but converges on the lower bound when the number of
embedded objects included in a web page is beyond the threshold. Our results
can be applied to the economic design and maintenance of web service.
