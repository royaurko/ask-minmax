The effect of direct processes on the statistical properties of deterministic
scattering processes in a chaotic waveguide is examined. The single channel
Poisson kernel describes well the distribution of S-matrix eigenphases when
evaluated over an energy interval. When direct processes are transformed away,
the scattering processes exhibit universal random matrix behavior. The effect
of chaos on scattering wavefunctions,eigenphases, and time delays is discussed.
