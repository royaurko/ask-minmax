The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02), which is scheduled to be deployed
onboard the International Space Station later this year, will be capable of
measuring the composition and spectra of GeV-TeV cosmic rays with unprecedented
precision. In this paper, we study how the projected measurements from AMS-02
of stable secondary-to-primary and unstable ratios (such as boron-to-carbon and
beryllium-10-to-beryllium-9) can constrain the models used to describe the
propagation of cosmic rays throughout the Milky Way. We find that within the
context of fairly simple propagation models, all of the model parameters can be
determined with high precision from the projected AMS-02 data. Such
measurements are less constraining in more complex scenarios, however, which
allow for departures from a power-law form for the diffusion coefficient, for
example, or for inhomogeneity or stochasticity in the distribution and chemical
abundances of cosmic ray sources.
