{\it Transcription} is the process whereby RNA molecules are polymerized by
molecular machines, called RNA polymerase (RNAP), using the corresponding DNA
as the template. Recent {\it in-vivo} experiments with single cells have
established that transcription takes place in "bursts" or "pulses". In this
letter we present a model that captures not only the mechano-chemistry of
individual RNAPs and their steric interactions but also the switching of the
gene between the ON and OFF states. This model accounts for the statistical
properties of the transcriptional bursts. It also shows how the quantitative
features of the distributions of these bursts can be tuned by controlling the
appropriate steps of operation of the RNAP machines.
