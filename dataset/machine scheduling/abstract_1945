We present the result of large-scale N-body simulations of the
stellar-dynamical evolution of a massive black-hole binary at the center of a
spherical galaxy. We focus on the dependence of the hardening rate on the
relaxation timescale of the parent galaxy. A simple theoretical argument
predicts that a binary black hole creates the ``loss cone'' around it. Once the
loss cone is formed, the hardening rate is determined by the rate at which
field stars diffuse into the loss cone. Therefore the hardening timescale
becomes proportional to the relaxation timescale. Recent N-body simulations,
however, have failed to confirm this theory and various explanations have been
proposed. By performing simulations with sufficiently large N (up to $10^6$)
for sufficiently long time, we found that the hardening rate does depend on N.
Our result is consistent with the simple theoretical prediction that the
hardening timescale is proportional to the relaxation timescale. This
dependence implies that most massive black hole binaries are unlikely to merge
within the Hubble time through interaction with field stars and gravitational
wave radiation alone.
