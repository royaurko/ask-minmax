Markov decision processes (MDP) are useful to model concurrent process
optimisation problems, but verifying them with numerical methods is often
intractable. Existing approximative approaches do not scale well and are
limited to memoryless schedulers. Here we present the basis of scalable
verification for MDPSs, using an O(1) memory representation of
history-dependent schedulers. We thus facilitate scalable learning techniques
and the use of massively parallel verification.
