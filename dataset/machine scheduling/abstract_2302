We consider a wireless system with a full-duplex (FD) access point (AP) that
transmits to a scheduled user in the downlink (DL) channel, while receiving
data from an user in the uplink (UL) channel at the same time on the same
frequency. In this system, loopback interference (LI) at the AP and inter user
interference between the uplink (UL) user and downlink (DL) user can cause
performance degradation. In order to characterize the effects of LI and inter
user interference, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability
and achievable sum rate of the system. In addition an asymptotic analysis that
reveals insights into the system behavior and performance degradation is
presented. Our results indicate that under certain conditions, FD transmissions
yield performance gains over half-duplex (HD) mode of operation.
