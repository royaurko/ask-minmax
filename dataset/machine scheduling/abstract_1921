We present BVRI photometry of the Type Ia supernovae 1999da, 1999dk, 1999gp,
2000bk, and 2000ce, plus infrared photometry of three of these. These objects
exhibit the full range of decline rates of Type Ia supernovae. Combined optical
and infrared data show that families of V - infrared color curves can be used
to derive the host extinction (A_V) of these objects. Existing data do not yet
allow us to construct these loci for all color indices and supernova decline
rates, but the V-K color evolution is sufficiently uniform that it allows the
determination of host extinction over a wide range of supernova decline rates
to an accuracy of roughly +/- 0.1 mag. We introduce a new empirical parameter,
the mean I-band flux 20 to 40 days after maximum light, and show how it is
directly related to the decline rate.
