Self-collision of a non-relativistic classical point-like body, or particle,
in the spacetime containing closed time-like curves (time-machine spacetime) is
considered. A point-like body (particle) is an idealization of a small ideal
elastic billiard ball. The known model of a time machine is used containing a
wormhole leading to the past. If the body enters one of the mouths of the
wormhole, it emerges from another mouth in an earlier time so that both the
particle and its "incarnation" coexist during some time and may collide. Such
self-collisions are considered in the case when the size of the body is much
less than the radius of the mouth, and the latter is much less than the
distance between the mouths. Three-dimensional configurations of trajectories
with a self-collision are presented. Their dynamics is investigated in detail.
Configurations corresponding to multiple wormhole traversals are discussed. It
is shown that, for each world line describing self-collision of a particle,
dynamically equivalent configurations exist in which the particle collides not
with itself but with an identical particle having a closed trajectory (Jinnee
of Time Machine).
