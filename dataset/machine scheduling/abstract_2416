We present Ringo, a system for analysis of large graphs. Graphs provide a way
to represent and analyze systems of interacting objects (people, proteins,
webpages) with edges between the objects denoting interactions (friendships,
physical interactions, links). Mining graphs provides valuable insights about
individual objects as well as the relationships among them.
  In building Ringo, we take advantage of the fact that machines with large
memory and many cores are widely available and also relatively affordable. This
allows us to build an easy-to-use interactive high-performance graph analytics
system. Graphs also need to be built from input data, which often resides in
the form of relational tables. Thus, Ringo provides rich functionality for
manipulating raw input data tables into various kinds of graphs. Furthermore,
Ringo also provides over 200 graph analytics functions that can then be applied
to constructed graphs.
  We show that a single big-memory machine provides a very attractive platform
for performing analytics on all but the largest graphs as it offers excellent
performance and ease of use as compared to alternative approaches. With Ringo,
we also demonstrate how to integrate graph analytics with an iterative process
of trial-and-error data exploration and rapid experimentation, common in data
mining workloads.
