The stabilization of uncertain LTI/LPV time delay systems with time varying
delays by state-feedback controllers is addressed. At the difference of other
works in the literature, the proposed approach allows for the synthesis of
resilient controllers with respect to uncertainties on the implemented delay.
It is emphasized that such controllers unify memoryless and exact-memory
controllers usually considered in the literature. The solutions to the
stability and stabilization problems are expressed in terms of LMIs which allow
to check the stability of the closed-loop system for a given bound on the
knowledge error and even optimize the uncertainty radius under some performance
constraints; in this paper, the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ performance measure is
considered. The interest of the approach is finally illustrated through several
examples.
