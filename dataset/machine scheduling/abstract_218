Grid computing is a computation methodology using group of clusters connected
over high-speed networks that involves coordinating and sharing computational
power, data storage and network resources. Integrating a set of clusters of
workstations into one large computing environment can improve the availability
of computing power. The goal of scheduling is to achieve highest possible
system throughput and to match the application need with the available
computing resources. A secure scheduling model is presented, that performs job
grouping activity at runtime. In a Grid environment, security is necessary
because grid is a dynamic environment and participates are independent bodies
with different policies, objectives and requirements. Authentication should be
verified for Grid resource owners as well as resource requesters before they
are allowed to join in scheduling activities. In order to achieve secure
resource and job scheduling including minimum processing time and maximum
resource utilization, A Secure Resource by using RSA algorithm on Networking
and Job Scheduling model with Job Grouping strategy(JGS) in Grid Computing has
been proposed. The result shows significant improvement in the processing time
of jobs and resource utilization as compared to dynamic job grouping (DJG)
based scheduling on smart grids (SG).
