Swift is the only observatory which, due to its unique fast-slewing
capability and broad-band energy coverage, can detect outbursts from Supergiant
Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs) from the very beginning and study their evolution
panchromatically. Thanks to its flexible observing scheduling, which makes
monitoring cost-effective, Swift has also performed a campaign that covers all
phases of the lives of SFXTs with a high sensitivity in the soft X-ray regime,
where most SFXTs had not been observed before. Our continued effort at
monitorning SFXTs with 2-3 observations per week (1-2 ks) with the Swift X-Ray
Telescope (XRT) over their entire visibility period has just finished its
second year. We report on our findings on the long-term properties of SFXTs,
their duty cycle, and the new outbursts caught by Swift during the second year.
