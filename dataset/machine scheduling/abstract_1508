PLQCD is a stand-alone software library developed under PRACE for lattice
QCD. It provides an implementation of the Dirac operator for Wilson type
fermions and few efficient linear solvers. The library is optimized for
multi-core machines using a hybrid parallelization with OpenMP+MPI. The main
objectives of the library is to provide a scalable implementation of the Dirac
operator for efficient computation of the quark propagator. In this
contribution, a description of the PLQCD library is given together with some
benchmark results.
