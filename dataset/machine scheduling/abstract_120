Bounded-rate multi-mode systems (BMMS) are hybrid systems that can switch
freely among a finite set of modes, and whose dynamics is specified by a finite
number of real-valued variables with mode-dependent rates that can vary within
given bounded sets. The schedulability problem for BMMS is defined as an
infinite-round game between two players---the scheduler and the
environment---where in each round the scheduler proposes a time and a mode
while the environment chooses an allowable rate for that mode, and the state of
the system changes linearly in the direction of the rate vector. The goal of
the scheduler is to keep the state of the system within a pre-specified safe
set using a non-Zeno schedule, while the goal of the environment is the
opposite. Green scheduling under uncertainty is a paradigmatic example of BMMS
where a winning strategy of the scheduler corresponds to a robust
energy-optimal policy. We present an algorithm to decide whether the scheduler
has a winning strategy from an arbitrary starting state, and give an algorithm
to compute such a winning strategy, if it exists. We show that the
schedulability problem for BMMS is co-NP complete in general, but for two
variables it is in PTIME. We also study the discrete schedulability problem
where the environment has only finitely many choices of rate vectors in each
mode and the scheduler can make decisions only at multiples of a given clock
period, and show it to be EXPTIME-complete.
