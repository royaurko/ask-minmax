With the advent of the wide-spread use of smart phones, video streaming over
mobile wireless networks has suddenly taken a huge surge in recent years.
Considering its enormous potential, mobile WiMAX is emerging as a viable
technology for mobile TV which is expected to become of key importance in the
future of mobile indus- try. In this paper, a simulation performance study of
Mobile TV over mobile WiMAX is conducted with different types of adaptive
modulation and coding taking into account key system and environment parameters
which include the variation in the speed of the mobile, path-loss, scheduling
service classes with the fixed type of mod- ulations. Our simulation has been
conducted using OPNET simulation. Simulation results show that dynamic
adaptation of modulation and coding schemes based onchannel conditions can
offer considerably more en- hanced QoS and at the same time reduce the overall
bandwidthof the system.
