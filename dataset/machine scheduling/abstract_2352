A relatively recent advance in cognitive neuroscience has been multi-voxel
pattern analysis (MVPA), which enables researchers to decode brain states
and/or the type of information represented in the brain during a cognitive
operation. MVPA methods utilize machine learning algorithms to distinguish
among types of information or cognitive states represented in the brain, based
on distributed patterns of neural activity. In the current investigation, we
propose a new approach for representation of neural data for pattern analysis,
namely a Mesh Learning Model. In this approach, at each time instant, a star
mesh is formed around each voxel, such that the voxel corresponding to the
center node is surrounded by its p-nearest neighbors. The arc weights of each
mesh are estimated from the voxel intensity values by least squares method. The
estimated arc weights of all the meshes, called Mesh Arc Descriptors (MADs),
are then used to train a classifier, such as Neural Networks, k-Nearest
Neighbor, Na\"ive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. The proposed Mesh Model
was tested on neuroimaging data acquired via functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) during a recognition memory experiment using categorized word
lists, employing a previously established experimental paradigm (\"Oztekin &
Badre, 2011). Results suggest that the proposed Mesh Learning approach can
provide an effective algorithm for pattern analysis of brain activity during
cognitive processing.
