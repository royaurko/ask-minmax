The possibility that experiments at high-energy accelerators could create new
forms of matter that would ultimately destroy the Earth has been considered
several times in the past quarter century. One consequence of the earliest of
these disaster scenarios was that the contributors of a 1993 article in "Physics
Today" who reviewed the experiments that had been carried out at the Bevalac at
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory were placed on the FBI's Unabomber watch list.
Later, concerns that experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at
Brookhaven National Laboratory might create mini black holes or nuggets of
stable strange quark matter resulted in a flurry of articles in the popular
press. I discuss this history, as well as Richard A. Posner's provocative
analysis and recommendations on how to deal with such scientific risks. I
conclude that better communication between scientists and nonscientists would
serve to assuage unreasonable fears and focus attention on truly serious
potential threats to humankind.
