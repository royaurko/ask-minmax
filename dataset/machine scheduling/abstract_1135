We report the occurrence of quenching and annealing in a version of the
Minority Game (MG) in which the winning option is to join a given fraction of
the population that is a free, external parameter. We compare this to the
different dynamics of the Bar Attendance Model (BAM) where the updating of the
attendance strategy makes use of all available information about the system and
quenching does not occur. We provide an annealing schedule by which the
quenched configuration of the MG reaches equilibrium and coincides with the one
obtained with the BAM
