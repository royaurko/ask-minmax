Passengers' experience is becoming a key metric to evaluate the air
transportation system's performance. Efficient and robust tools to handle
airport operations are needed along with a better understanding of passengers'
interests and concerns. Among various airport operations, this paper studies
airport gate scheduling for improved passengers' experience. Three objectives
accounting for passengers, aircraft, and operation are presented. Trade-offs
between these objectives are analyzed, and a balancing objective function is
proposed. The results show that the balanced objective can improve the
efficiency of traffic flow in passenger terminals and on ramps, as well as the
robustness of gate operations.
