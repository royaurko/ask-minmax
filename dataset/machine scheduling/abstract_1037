This paper introduces a machine learning based collaborative multi-band
spectrum sensing policy for cognitive radios. The proposed sensing policy
guides secondary users to focus the search of unused radio spectrum to those
frequencies that persistently provide them high data rate. The proposed policy
is based on machine learning, which makes it adaptive with the temporally and
spatially varying radio spectrum. Furthermore, there is no need for dynamic
modeling of the primary activity since it is implicitly learned over time.
Energy efficiency is achieved by minimizing the number of assigned sensors per
each subband under a constraint on miss detection probability. It is important
to control the missed detections because they cause collisions with primary
transmissions and lead to retransmissions at both the primary and secondary
user. Simulations show that the proposed machine learning based sensing policy
improves the overall throughput of the secondary network and improves the
energy efficiency while controlling the miss detection probability.
