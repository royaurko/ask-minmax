Nowadays, Vending Machines are well known among Japan, Malaysia and
Singapore. The quantity of machines in these countries is on the top worldwide.
This is due to the modern lifestyles which require fast food processing with
high quality. This paper describes the designing of multi select machine using
Finite State Machine Model with Auto-Billing Features. Finite State Machine
(FSM) modelling is the most crucial part in developing proposed model as this
reduces the hardware. In this paper the process of four state (user Selection,
Waiting for money insertion, product delivery and servicing) has been modelled
using MEALY Machine Model. The proposed model is tested using Spartan 3
development board and its performance is compared with CMOS based machine.
