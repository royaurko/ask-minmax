CREAM (Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass) is a multi-flight balloon mission
designed to collect direct data on the elemental composition and individual
energy spectra of cosmic rays. Two instrument suites have been built to be
flown alternately on a yearly base. The tungsten/Sci-Fi imaging calorimeter for
the second flight, scheduled for December 2005, was calibrated with electron
and proton beams at CERN. A calibration procedure based on the study of the
longitudinal shower profile is described and preliminary results of the beam
test are presented.
