Bike-sharing systems are a means of smart transportation in urban
environments with the benefit of a positive impact on urban mobility. In this
paper we are interested in studying and modeling the behavior of features that
permit the end user to access, with her/his web browser, the status of the
Bike-Sharing system. In particular, we address features able to make a
prediction on the system state. We propose to use a machine learning approach
to analyze usage patterns and learn computational models of such features from
logs of system usage.
  On the one hand, machine learning methodologies provide a powerful and
general means to implement a wide choice of predictive features. On the other
hand, trained machine learning models are provided with a measure of predictive
performance that can be used as a metric to assess the cost-performance
trade-off of the feature. This provides a principled way to assess the runtime
behavior of different components before putting them into operation.
