Cloud computing is getting mature, and the interoperability and
standardization of the clouds is still waiting to be solved. This paper
discussed the interoperability among clouds about message transmission, data
transmission and virtual machine transfer. Starting from IEEE Pioneering Cloud
Computing Initiative, this paper discussed about standardization of the cloud
computing, especially intercloud cloud computing. This paper also discussed the
standardization from the market-oriented view.
