A concept of "evolving categories" is suggested to build a simple, scalable,
mathematically consistent framework for representing in uniform way both data
and algorithms. A state machine for executing algorithms becomes clear, rich
and powerful semantics, based on category theory, and still allows easy
implementation. Moreover, it gives an original insight into the nature and
semantics of algorithms.
