We examine inkdots placed on the input string as a way of providing advice to
finite automata, and establish the relations between this model and the
previously studied models of advised finite automata. The existence of an
infinite hierarchy of classes of languages that can be recognized with the help
of increasing numbers of inkdots as advice is shown. We study randomly placed
inkdots as advice to probabilistic finite automata, and demonstrate the
superiority of this model over its deterministic version. Even very slowly
growing amounts of space can become a resource of meaningful use if the
underlying advised model is extended with access to secondary memory, while it
is famously known that such small amounts of space are not useful for unadvised
one-way Turing machines. The effects of different forms of advice on the
succinctness of the advised machines are also examined.
