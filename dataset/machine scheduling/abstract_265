In this paper, we address the global and preemptive energy-aware scheduling
problem of sporadic constrained-deadline tasks on DVFS-identical multiprocessor
platforms. We propose an online slack reclamation scheme which profits from the
discrepancy between the worst- and actual-case execution time of the tasks by
slowing down the speed of the processors in order to save energy. Our algorithm
called MORA takes into account the application-specific consumption profile of
the tasks. We demonstrate that MORA does not jeopardize the system
schedulability and we show by performing simulations that it can save up to 32%
of energy (in average) compared to execution without using any energy-aware
algorithm.
