In 1975, Chaitin introduced his celebrated Omega number, the halting
probability of a universal Chaitin machine, a universal Turing machine with a
prefix-free domain. The Omega number's bits are {\em algorithmically
random}--there is no reason the bits should be the way they are, if we define
``reason'' to be a computable explanation smaller than the data itself. Since
that time, only {\em two} explicit universal Chaitin machines have been
proposed, both by Chaitin himself.
  Concrete algorithmic information theory involves the study of particular
universal Turing machines, about which one can state theorems with specific
numerical bounds, rather than include terms like O(1). We present several new
tiny Chaitin machines (those with a prefix-free domain) suitable for the study
of concrete algorithmic information theory. One of the machines, which we call
Keraia, is a binary encoding of lambda calculus based on a curried lambda
operator. Source code is included in the appendices.
  We also give an algorithm for restricting the domain of blank-endmarker
machines to a prefix-free domain over an alphabet that does not include the
endmarker; this allows one to take many universal Turing machines and construct
universal Chaitin machines from them.
