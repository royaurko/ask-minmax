A novel energy reduction strategy to maximally exploit the dynamic workload
variation is proposed for the offline voltage scheduling of preemptive systems.
The idea is to construct a fully-preemptive schedule that leads to minimum
energy consumption when the tasks take on approximately the average execution
cycles yet still guarantees no deadline violation during the worst-case
scenario. End-time for each sub-instance of the tasks obtained from the
schedule is used for the on-line dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) of the tasks.
For the tasks that normally require a small number of cycles but occasionally a
large number of cycles to complete, such a schedule provides more opportunities
for slack utilization and hence results in larger energy saving. The concept is
realized by formulating the problem as a Non-Linear Programming (NLP)
optimization problem. Experimental results show that, by using the proposed
scheme, the total energy consumption at runtime is reduced by as high as 60%
for randomly generated task sets when comparing with the static scheduling
approach only using worst case workload.
