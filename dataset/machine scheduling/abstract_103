We study the makespan minimization problem with unrelated selfish machines
under the assumption that job sizes are stochastic. We design simple truthful
mechanisms that under various distributional assumptions provide constant and
sublogarithmic approximations to expected makespan. Our mechanisms are
prior-independent in that they do not rely on knowledge of the job size
distributions. Prior-independent approximation mechanisms have been previously
studied for the objective of revenue maximization [Dhangwatnotai, Roughgarden
and Yan'10, Devanur, Hartline, Karlin and Nguyen'11, Roughgarden, Talgam-Cohen
and Yan'12]. In contrast to our results, in prior-free settings no truthful
anonymous deterministic mechanism for the makespan objective can provide a
sublinear approximation [Ashlagi, Dobzinski and Lavi'09].
