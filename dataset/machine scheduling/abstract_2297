ASTRO-H, the sixth Japanese X-ray observatory, which is scheduled to be
launched by the end of Japanese fiscal year 2015 has a capability to observe
the prompt emission from Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) utilizing BGO active shields
for the soft gamma-ray detector (SGD). The effective area of the SGD shield
detectors is very large and its data acquisition system is optimized for short
transients such as short GRBs. Thus, we expect to perform more detailed
time-resolved spectral analysis with a combination of ASTRO-H and Fermi LAT/GBM
to investigate the gamma-ray emission mechanism of short GRBs. In addition, the
environment of the GRB progenitor should be a remarkable objective from the
point of view of the chemical evolution of high-z universe. If we can maneuver
the spacecraft to the GRBs, we can perform a high-resolution spectroscopy of
the X-ray afterglow of GRBs utilizing the onboard micro calorimeter and X-ray
CCD camera.
