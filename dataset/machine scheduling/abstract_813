We consider the problem of a social group of users trying to obtain a
"universe" of files, first from a server and then via exchange amongst
themselves. We consider the selfish file-exchange paradigm of give-and-take,
whereby two users can exchange files only if each has something unique to offer
the other. We are interested in maximizing the number of users who can obtain
the universe through a schedule of file-exchanges. We first present a practical
paradigm of file acquisition. We then present an algorithm which ensures that
at least half the users obtain the universe with high probability for $n$ files
and $m=O(\log n)$ users when $n\rightarrow\infty$, thereby showing an
approximation ratio of 2. Extending these ideas, we show a $1+\epsilon_1$ -
approximation algorithm for $m=O(n)$, $\epsilon_1>0$ and a $(1+z)/2
+\epsilon_2$ - approximation algorithm for $m=O(n^z)$, $z>1$, $\epsilon_2>0$.
Finally, we show that for any $m=O(e^{o(n)})$, there exists a schedule of file
exchanges which ensures that at least half the users obtain the universe.
