In this paper, I discuss machine translation of English text into Turkish, a
relatively ``free'' word order language. I present algorithms that determine
the topic and the focus of each target sentence (using salience (Centering
Theory), old vs. new information, and contrastiveness in the discourse model)
in order to generate the contextually appropriate word orders in the target
language.
