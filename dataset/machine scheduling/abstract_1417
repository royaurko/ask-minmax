The challenge of the Reengineering Case is to extract a state machine model
out of the abstract syntax graph of a Java program. The extracted state machine
offers a reduced view on the full program graph and thus helps to understand
the program regarding the question of interest. We tackle this task employing
the general purpose graph rewrite system GrGen.NET (www.grgen.net).
