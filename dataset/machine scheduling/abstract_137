The main objective of this paper is to improve the Round Robin scheduling
algorithm using the dynamic time slice concept. CPU scheduling becomes very
important in accomplishing the operating system (OS) design goals. The
intention should be allowed as many as possible running processes at all time
in order to make best use of CPU. CPU scheduling has strong effect on resource
utilization as well as overall performance of the system. Round Robin algorithm
performs optimally in time-shared systems, but it is not suitable for soft real
time systems, because it gives more number of context switches, larger waiting
time and larger response time. In this paper, a new CPU scheduling algorithm
called An Optimum Multilevel Dynamic Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm is
proposed, which calculates intelligent time slice and changes after every round
of execution. The suggested algorithm was evaluated on some CPU scheduling
objectives and it was observed that this algorithm gave good performance as
compared to the other existing CPU scheduling algorithms.
