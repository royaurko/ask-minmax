We review the current status of determinations of the b-quark mass, m_b. We
describe the theoretical tools required for determining m_b, with particular
emphasis on effective field theories both in the continuum and on the lattice.
We present several definitions of m_b and highlight their advantages and
disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the determinations of m_b from b-bar b
systems, b-flavored hadrons, and high-energy processes, with careful attention
to the corresponding theoretical uncertainties.
