Artificial neural networks are simple and efficient machine learning tools.
Defined originally in the traditional setting of simple vector data, neural
network models have evolved to address more and more difficulties of complex
real world problems, ranging from time evolving data to sophisticated data
structures such as graphs and functions. This paper summarizes advances on
those themes from the last decade, with a focus on results obtained by members
