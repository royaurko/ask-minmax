Physics dictates that cars with small mass will travel more miles per gallon
(mpg) compared to massive trucks. Does this imply that small cars are more
efficient machines? In this work a mileage efficiency metric is defined as a
ratio of actual car mileage (mpg) to the mileage of an ideal car. This metric
allows comparison of efficiencies of cars with different masses and fuel types.
It is as useful to quantify efficiencies of cars as the concept of drag
coefficient is to quantify the efficacy of their aerodynamic shapes. Maximum
mileage and lowest CO2 emission of conventional gasoline cars, at different
driving schedules, is reported based on the concept of an ideal car. This can
help put government imposed standards in a rigorous context.
