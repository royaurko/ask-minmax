This paper presents the results of an empirical investigation of temporal
reference resolution in scheduling dialogs. The algorithm adopted is primarily
a linear-recency based approach that does not include a model of global focus.
A fully automatic system has been developed and evaluated on unseen test data
with good results. This paper presents the results of an intercoder reliability
study, a model of temporal reference resolution that supports linear recency
and has very good coverage, the results of the system evaluated on unseen test
data, and a detailed analysis of the dialogs assessing the viability of the
approach.
