MapReduce is emerged as a prominent programming model for data-intensive
computation. In this work, we study power-aware MapReduce scheduling in the
speed scaling setting first introduced by Yao et al. [FOCS 1995]. We focus on
the minimization of the total weighted completion time of a set of MapReduce
jobs under a given budget of energy. Using a linear programming relaxation of
our problem, we derive a polynomial time constant-factor approximation
algorithm. We also propose a convex programming formulation that we combine
with standard list scheduling policies, and we evaluate their performance using
simulations.
