The web information resources are growing explosively in number and volume.
Now to retrieve relevant data from web has become very difficult and
time-consuming. Semantic Web envisions that these web resources should be
developed in machine-processable way in order to handle irrelevancy and manual
processing problems. Whereas, the Semantic Web is an extension of current web,
in which web resources are equipped with formal semantics about their
interpretation through machines. These web resources are usually contained in
web applications and systems, and their formal semantics are normally
represented in the form of web-ontologies. In this research paper, an
object-oriented design methodology (OODM) is upgraded for developing semantic
web applications. OODM has been developed for designing of web applications for
the current web. This methodology is good enough to develop web applications.
It also provides a systematic approach for the web applications development but
it is not helpful in generating machine-pocessable content of web applications
in their development. Therefore, this methodology needs to be extended. In this
paper, we propose that extension in OODM. This new extended version is referred
to as the semantic web object-oriented design methodology (SW-OODM).
