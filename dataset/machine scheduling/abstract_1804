Many signal processing and machine learning methods share essentially the
same linear-in-the-parameter model, with as many parameters as available
samples as in kernel-based machines. Sparse approximation is essential in many
disciplines, with new challenges emerging in online learning with kernels. To
this end, several sparsity measures have been proposed in the literature to
quantify sparse dictionaries and constructing relevant ones, the most prolific
ones being the distance, the approximation, the coherence and the Babel
measures. In this paper, we analyze sparse dictionaries based on these
measures. By conducting an eigenvalue analysis, we show that these sparsity
measures share many properties, including the linear independence condition and
inducing a well-posed optimization problem. Furthermore, we prove that there
exists a quasi-isometry between the parameter (i.e., dual) space and the
dictionary's induced feature space.
