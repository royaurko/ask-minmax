Four-particle correlations in fermion systems at finite temperatures are
investigated with special attention to the formation of a condensate. Instead
of the instability of the normal state with respect to the onset of pairing
described by the Gorkov equation, a new equation is obtained which describes
the onset of quartetting. Within a model calculation for symmetric nuclear
matter, we find that below a critical density, the four-particle condensation
(alpha-like quartetting) is favored over deuteron condensation (triplet
pairing). This pairing-quartetting competition is expected to be a general
feature of interacting fermion systems, such as the excition-biexciton system
in excited semiconductors. Possible experimental consequences are pointed out.
