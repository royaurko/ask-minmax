This paper reviews the Church-Turing Thesis (or rather, theses) with
reference to their origin and application and considers some models of
"hypercomputation", concentrating on perhaps the most straight-forward option:
Zeno machines (Turing machines with accelerating clock). The halting problem is
briefly discussed in a general context and the suggestion that it is an
inevitable companion of any reasonable computational model is emphasised. It is
hinted that claims to have "broken the Turing barrier" could be toned down and
that the important and well-founded role of Turing computability in the
mathematical sciences stands unchallenged.
