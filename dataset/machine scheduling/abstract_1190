We give a real-time semantics for the concurrent, object-oriented modeling
language Creol, by mapping Creol processes to a network of timed automata. We
can use our semantics to verify real time properties of Creol objects, in
particular to see whether processes can be scheduled correctly and meet their
end-to-end deadlines. Real-time Creol can be useful for analyzing, for
instance, abstract models of multi-core embedded systems. We show how analysis
can be done in Uppaal.
