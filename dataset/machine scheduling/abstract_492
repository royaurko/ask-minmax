The main objective of this paper is to develop the two different ways in
which round robin architecture is modified and made suitable to be implemented
in real time and embedded systems. The scheduling algorithm plays a significant
role in the design of real time embedded systems. Simple round robin
architecture is not efficient to be implemented in embedded systems because of
higher context switch rate, larger waiting time and larger response time.
Missing of deadlines will degrade the system performance in soft real time
systems. The main objective of this paper is to develop the scheduling
algorithm which removes the drawbacks in simple round robin architecture. A
comparison with round robin architecture to the proposed architectures has been
made. It is observed that the proposed architectures solves the problems
encountered in round robin architecture in soft real time by decreasing the
number of context switches waiting time and response time thereby increasing
the system throughput.
