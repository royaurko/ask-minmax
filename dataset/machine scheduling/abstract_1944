Because several observing programs are underway in various spectral regimes
to explore the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S), the value of local photometric
standards is obvious. As part of an NOAO Surveys Program to establish
u'g'r'i'z' standard stars in the southern hemisphere, we have observed the
central region of the CDF-S to create local standards for use by other
investigators using these filters. As a courtesy, we present the CDF-S
standards to the public now, although the main program will not finish until
mid-2005.
