Speech is a natural form of communication for human beings, and computers
with the ability to understand speech and speak with a human voice are expected
to contribute to the development of more natural man-machine interfaces.
Computers with this kind of ability are gradually becoming a reality, through
the evolution of speech recognition technologies. Speech is being an important
mode of interaction with computers. In this paper Feature extraction is
implemented using well-known Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC).Pattern
matching is done using Dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm.
