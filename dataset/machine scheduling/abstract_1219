The Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) is a Chinese space telescope
mission. It is scheduled for launch in 2015. The telescope will perform an
all-sky survey in hard X-ray band (1 - 250 keV), a series of deep imaging
observations of small sky regions as well as pointed observations. In this work
we present a conceptual method to reconstruct light curves from HXMT imaging
observation directly, in order to monitor time-varying objects such as GRB, AXP
and SGR in hard X-ray band with HXMT imaging observations.
