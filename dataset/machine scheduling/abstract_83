In this paper we study the scheduling of (m,k)-firm synchronous periodic task
systems using the Distance Based Priority (DBP) scheduler. We first show three
phenomena: (i) choosing, for each task, the initial k-sequence 1^k is not
optimal, (ii) we can even start the scheduling from a (fictive) error state (in
regard to the initial k-sequence) and (iii) the period of feasible
DBP-schedules is not necessarily the task hyper-period. We then show that any
feasible DBP-schedule is periodic and we upper-bound the length of that period.
Lastly, based on our periodicity result we provide an exact schedulability
test.
