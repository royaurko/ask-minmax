Accurately estimate performance of currently available processors is becoming
a key activity, particularly in HENP environment, where high computing power is
crucial. This document describes the methods and programs, opensource or
freeware, used to benchmark processors, memory and disk subsystems and network
connection architectures. These tools are also useful to stress test new
machines, before their acquisition or before their introduction in a production
environment, where high uptimes are requested.
