Biological systems typically involve large numbers of components with
complex, highly parallel interactions and intrinsic stochasticity. To model
this complexity, numerous programming languages based on process calculi have
been developed, many of which are expressive enough to generate unbounded
numbers of molecular species and reactions. As a result of this expressiveness,
such calculi cannot rely on standard reaction-based simulation methods, which
require fixed numbers of species and reactions. Rather than implementing custom
stochastic simulation algorithms for each process calculus, we propose to use a
generic abstract machine that can be instantiated to a range of process calculi
and a range of reaction-based simulation algorithms. The abstract machine
functions as a just-in-time compiler, which dynamically updates the set of
possible reactions and chooses the next reaction in an iterative cycle. In this
short paper we give a brief summary of the generic abstract machine, and show
how it can be instantiated with the stochastic simulation algorithm known as
Gillespie's Direct Method. We also discuss the wider implications of such an
abstract machine, and outline how it can be used to simulate multiple calculi
simultaneously within a common framework.
