We present a new mixture model-based discriminant analysis approach for
functional data using a specific hidden process regression model. The approach
allows for fitting flexible curve-models to each class of complex-shaped curves
presenting regime changes. The model parameters are learned by maximizing the
observed-data log-likelihood for each class by using a dedicated
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Comparisons on simulated data with
alternative approaches show that the proposed approach provides better results.
