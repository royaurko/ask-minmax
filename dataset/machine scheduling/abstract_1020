This paper addresses an interval analysis based study that is applied to the
design and the comparison of 3-DOF parallel kinematic machines. Two design
criteria are used, (i) a regular workspace shape and, (ii) a kinetostatic
performance index that needs to be as homogeneous as possible throughout the
workspace. The interval analysis based method takes these two criteria into
account: on the basis of prescribed kinetostatic performances, the workspace is
analysed to find out the largest regular dextrous workspace enclosed in the
Cartesian workspace. An algorithm describing this method is introduced. Two
3-DOF translational parallel mechanisms designed for machining applications are
compared using this method. The first machine features three fixed linear
joints which are mounted orthogonally and the second one features three linear
joints which are mounted in parallel. In both cases, the mobile platform moves
in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation.
