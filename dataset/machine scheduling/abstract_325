The link scheduling in wireless multi-hop networks is addressed. Different
from most of work that adopt the protocol interference model which merely take
consideration of packet collisions, our proposed algorithms use the physical
interference model to reflect the aggregated signal to interference and noise
ratio (SINR), which is a more accurate abstraction of the real scenario. We
first propose a centralized scheduling method based on the Integer Linear
Programming (ILP) and resolve it by an approximate solution based on the
randomized rounding method. The probability bound of getting a guaranteed
approximate factor is given. We then extend the centralized algorithm to a
distributed solution, which is favorable in wireless networks. It is proven
that with the distributed scheduling method, all links can transmit without
interference, and the approximate ratio of the algorithm is also given.
