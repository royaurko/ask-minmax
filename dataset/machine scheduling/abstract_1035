Within the context of High Speed Machining, it is essential to manage the
trajectory generation to achieve both high surface quality and high
productivity. As feed drives are one part of the set Machine tool - Numerical
Controller, it is necessary to improve their performances to optimize feed
drive dynamics during trajectory follow up. Hence, this paper deals with the
modelling of the feed drive in the case of multi axis machining. This model can
be used for the simulation of axis dynamics and tool-path tracking to tune
parameters and optimize new frameworks of command strategies. A procedure of
identification based on modern NC capabilities is presented and applied to
industrial HSM centres. Efficiency of this modelling is assessed by
experimental verifications on various representative trajectories. After
implementing a Generalized Predictive Control, reliable simulations are
performed thanks to the model. These simulations can then be used to tune
parameters of this new framework according to the tool-path geometry.
