This article gives an overview of the available literature on simplified,
well defined (quasi-)homogeneous laboratory samples. After more than 50 years
of research on superconductivity in Nb3Sn, a significant amount of results are
available, but these are scattered over a multitude of publications. Two
reviews exist on the basic properties of A15 materials in general, but no
specific review for Nb3Sn is available. This article is intended to provide
such an overview. It starts with a basic description of the Niobium-Tin
intermetallic. After this it maps the influence of Sn content on the the
electron-phonon interaction strength and on the field-temperature phase
boundary. The literature on the influence of Cu, Ti and Ta additions will then
be briefly summarized. This is followed by a review on the effects of grain
size and strain. The article is concluded with a summary of the main results.
