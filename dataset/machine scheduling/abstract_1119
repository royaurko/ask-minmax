The Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) satellite is scheduled to launch in
mid-2001. MAP's goal is to produce a map of the anisotropy in the cosmic
microwave background of unprecedented accuracy and precision. The guiding
design principle has been the minimization of systematic effects. The
instrument design and mapping strategy work in concert to take advantage of the
unique opportunities afforded by deep space. We give an overview of the mission
and compare the projected MAP error bars to recent measurements.
