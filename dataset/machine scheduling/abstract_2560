We present an actor-critic framework for MDPs where the objective is the
variance-adjusted expected return. Our critic uses linear function
approximation, and we extend the concept of compatible features to the
variance-adjusted setting. We present an episodic actor-critic algorithm and
show that it converges almost surely to a locally optimal point of the
objective function.
