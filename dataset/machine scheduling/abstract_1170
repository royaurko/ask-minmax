More than 50 abstracts were submitted to the A4 session on "Alternatives
Theories of Gravity" at the GRG18 conference. About 30 of them were scheduled
as oral presentations, that we summarize below. We do not intend to give a
critical review, but rather pointers to the corresponding papers. The main
topics were (i) brane models both from the mathematical and the
phenomenological viewpoints; (ii) Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in higher
dimensions or coupled to a scalar field; (iii) modified Newtonian dynamics
(MOND); (iv) scalar-tensor and f(R) theories; (v) alternative models involving
Lorentz violations, noncommutative spacetimes or Chern-Simons corrections.
