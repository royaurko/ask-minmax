We present a method for scheduling observations in small field-of-view
transient targeted surveys. The method is based on maximizing the probability
of detection of transient events of a given type and age since occurrence; it
requires knowledge of the time since the last observation for every observed
field, the expected light curve of the event, and the expected rate of events
in the fields where the search is performed. In order to test this scheduling
strategy we use a modified version of the genetic scheduler developed for the
telescope control system RTS2. In particular, we present example schedules
designed for a future 50 cm telescope that will expand the capabilities of the
CHASE survey, which aims to detect young supernova events in nearby galaxies.
We also include a brief description of the telescope and the status of the
project, which is expected to enter a commissioning phase in 2010.
