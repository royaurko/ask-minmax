We investigate the lattice of machine invariant classes. This is an infinite
completely distributive lattice but it is not a Boolean lattice. We show the
subword complexity and the growth function create machine invariant classes. So
the lattice would serve as a measure of words cryptographic quality if we like
to identify new stream ciphers suitable for widespread adoption.
