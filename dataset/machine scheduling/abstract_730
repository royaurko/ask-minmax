Many machine learning (ML) approaches are widely used to generate bioclimatic
models for prediction of geographic range of organism as a function of climate.
Applications such as prediction of range shift in organism, range of invasive
species influenced by climate change are important parameters in understanding
the impact of climate change. However, success of machine learning-based
approaches depends on a number of factors. While it can be safely said that no
particular ML technique can be effective in all applications and success of a
technique is predominantly dependent on the application or the type of the
problem, it is useful to understand their behaviour to ensure informed choice
of techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive review of machine
learning-based bioclimatic model generation and analyses the factors
influencing success of such models. Considering the wide use of statistical
techniques, in our discussion we also include conventional statistical
techniques used in bioclimatic modelling.
