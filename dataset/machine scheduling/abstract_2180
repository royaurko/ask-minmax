Several models have been proposed to explain the dark energy that is causing
universe expansion to accelerate. Here the acceleration predicted by the
Holographic Dark Information Energy (HDIE) model is compared to the
acceleration that would be produced by a cosmological constant. While identical
to a cosmological constant at low redshifts, z<1, the HDIE model results in
smaller Hubble parameter values at higher redshifts, z>1, reaching a maximum
difference of 2.6 +-0.5% around z~1.7. The next generation of dark energy
measurements, both those scheduled to be made in space (ESA's Euclid and NASA's
WFIRST missions) and those to be made on the ground (BigBOSS, LSST and Dark
Energy Survey), should be capable of determining whether such a difference
signature exists or not. The HDIE model is therefore falsifiable.
