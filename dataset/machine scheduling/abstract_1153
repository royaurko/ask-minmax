The radiative meson decays $V\to P\gamma$ and $P\to \gamma\gamma$ are
analyzed using the quark triangle diagram. Experimental data yield well
determined estimates of the universal quark-antiquark-meson couplings
$g_{Vq\bar{q}'}$ and $g_{Pq\bar{q}'}$ for the light meson sector. Also
predictions for the ratios of neutral to charged heavy meson decay coupling
constants are given and await experimental confirmation.
