Planning, scheduling and dispatching play critical roles in the operations of
a supply chain. Their definitions are clearly given through a unified view in
this paper. The distinction between planning and scheduling is analyzed from
the view point of microeconomics and queueing theory. The distinction between
scheduling and dispatching is analyzed from the view point of computational
complexity and hierarchical decomposition. Based on the elasticity of price and
capacity, planning can be separated into demand planning or capacity planning.
Scheduling period is the time horizon where price and average production cost
are insensitive to the production rate. The critical roles of the master
production schedule and move targets in job scheduling have been explained
through the concept of hierarchical decomposition. Dispatching is the last
layer of job scheduling in the hierarchical decomposition. The advantage of
pull and push systems has been compared and analyzed systematically.
