HD 82943 hosts a mysterious multi-planet system in the 2:1 mean-motion
resonance that puzzles astronomers for more than a decade. We describe our new
analysis of all radial velocity data currently available for this star,
including both the most recent Keck data and the older but more numerous
CORALIE measurements.
  Here we pay a major attention to the task of optimal scheduling of the future
observation of this system. Applying several optimality criteria, we
demonstrate that in the forthcoming observational season of HD 82943 (the
winter 2014/2015) rather promising time ranges can be found. Observations of
the near future may give rather remarkable improvement of the orbital fit, but
only if we choose their time carefully.
