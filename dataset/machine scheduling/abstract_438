Real time system technology traditionally developed for safety critical
systems, has now been extended to support multimedia systems and virtual
reality. A large number of real-time application, related to multimedia and
adaptive control system, require more flexibility than classical real-time
theory usually permits. This paper proposes an efficient adaptive scheduling
framework in real-time systems based on period adjustment. Under this model
periodic task can change their execution rates based on their importance value
to keep the system underloaded. We propose Period_Adjust algorithm, which
consider the tasks whose periods are bounded as well as the tasks whose periods
are not bounded.
