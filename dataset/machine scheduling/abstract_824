Collisions are a main cause of throughput degradation in Wireless LANs. The
current contention mechanism for these networks is based on a random backoff
strategy to avoid collisions with other transmitters. Even though it can reduce
the probability of collisions, the random backoff prevents users from achieving
Collision-Free schedules, where the channel would be used more efficiently.
Modifying the contention mechanism by waiting for a deterministic timer after
successful transmissions, users would be able to construct a Collision-Free
schedule among successful contenders. This work shows the experimental results
of a Collision-Free MAC (CF-MAC) protocol for WLANs using commercial hardware
and open firmware for wireless network cards which is able to support many
users. Testbed results show that the proposed CF-MAC protocol leads to a better
distribution of the available bandwidth among users, higher throughput and
lower losses than the unmodified WLANs clients using a legacy firmware.
