This paper investigates three open problems in random beamforming based
communication systems: the scheduling policy with heterogeneous users, the
closed form sum rate, and the randomness of multiuser diversity with selective
feedback. By employing the cumulative distribution function based scheduling
policy, we guarantee fairness among users as well as obtain multiuser diversity
gain in the heterogeneous scenario. Under this scheduling framework, the
individual sum rate, namely the average rate for a given user multiplied by the
number of users, is of interest and analyzed under different feedback schemes.
Firstly, under the full feedback scheme, we derive the closed form individual
sum rate by employing a decomposition of the probability density function of
the selected user's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. This technique is
employed to further obtain a closed form rate approximation with selective
feedback in the spatial dimension. The analysis is also extended to random
beamforming in a wideband OFDMA system with additional selective feedback in
the spectral dimension wherein only the best beams for the best-L resource
blocks are fed back. We utilize extreme value theory to examine the randomness
of multiuser diversity incurred by selective feedback. Finally, by leveraging
the tail equivalence method, the multiplicative effect of selective feedback
and random observations is observed to establish the individual rate scaling.
