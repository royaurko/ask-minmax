The prediction of a stock market direction may serve as an early
recommendation system for short-term investors and as an early financial
distress warning system for long-term shareholders. In this paper, we propose
an empirical study on the Korean and Hong Kong stock market with an integrated
machine learning framework that employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
Support Vector Machine (SVM). We try to predict the upward or downward
direction of stock market index and stock price. In the proposed framework,
PCA, as a feature selection method, identifies principal components in the
stock market movement and SVM, as a classifier for future stock market
movement, processes them along with other economic factors in training and
forecasting. We present the results of an extensive empirical study of the
proposed method on the Korean composite stock price index (KOSPI) and Hangseng
index (HSI), as well as the individual constituents included in the indices. In
our experiment, ten years data (from January 1st, 2002 to January 1st, 2012)
are collected and schemed by rolling windows to predict one-day-ahead
directions. The experimental results show notably high hit ratios in predicting
the movements of the individual constituents in the KOSPI and HSI. The results
also varify the \textit{co-movement} effect between the Korean (Hong Kong)
stock market and the American stock market.
