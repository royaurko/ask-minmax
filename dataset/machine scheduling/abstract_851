We present here a machine that is capable of extracting work from a single
heat bath. Although no significant temperature gradient is involved in the
operation of the machine, yet the Carnot efficiency as high as one is
achievable. Working of the machine is explained on the basis of a demon
suggested by Maxwell. Utilizing the kinetic energy spectrum of the molecules in
solution, the demon can send "hotter" molecules to a higher gravitational
potential at the expense of their own energies. Difference in chemical
potentials due to concentration gradients and use of semi-permeable membranes
ensure the continuing cyclic process.
