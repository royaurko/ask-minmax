Within the context of 5-axis free-form machining, CAM software offers various
ways of tool-path generation, depending on the geometry of the surface to be
machined. Therefore, as the manufactured surface quality results from the
choice of the machining strategy and machining parameters, the prediction of
surface roughness in function of the machining conditions is an important issue
in 5-axis machining. The objective of this paper is to propose a simulation
model of material removal in 5-axis based on the N-buffer method and
integrating the Inverse Kinematics Transformation. The tooth track is linked
with the velocity giving the surface topography resulting from actual machining
conditions. The model is assessed thanks to a series of sweeping over planes
according to various tool axis orientations and cutting conditions. 3D surface
topography analyses are performed through the new areal surface roughness
parameters proposed by recent standards.
