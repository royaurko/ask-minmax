In this paper, a many-sources large deviations principle (LDP) for the
transient workload of a multi-queue single-server system is established where
the service rates are chosen from a compact, convex and coordinate-convex rate
region and where the service discipline is the max-weight policy. Under the
assumption that the arrival processes satisfy a many-sources LDP, this is
accomplished by employing Garcia's extended contraction principle that is
applicable to quasi-continuous mappings.
  For the simplex rate-region, an LDP for the stationary workload is also
established under the additional requirements that the scheduling policy be
work-conserving and that the arrival processes satisfy certain mixing
conditions.
  The LDP results can be used to calculate asymptotic buffer overflow
probabilities accounting for the multiplexing gain, when the arrival process is
an average of \emph{i.i.d.} processes. The rate function for the stationary
workload is expressed in term of the rate functions of the finite-horizon
workloads when the arrival processes have \emph{i.i.d.} increments.
