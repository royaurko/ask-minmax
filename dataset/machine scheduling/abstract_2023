The nucleus 94Mo was investigated using a powerful combination of
gamma-singles photon scattering experiments and gamma-gamma-coincidence studies
following the beta-decay of 94mTc. The data survey short-lived J^pi=1+,2+
states and include branching ratios, E2/M1 mixing ratios, lifetimes, and
transition strengths. The mixed-symmetry (MS) 1+ scissors mode and the 2+ MS
state are identified from M1 strengths. A gamma transition between MS states
was observed and its rate was measured. Nine M1 and E2 strengths involving MS
states agree with the O(6) limit of the interacting boson model-2 using the
proton boson E2 charge as the only free parameter.
