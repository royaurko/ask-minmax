The Arecibo L-Band Feed Array Zone of Avoidance (ALFA ZOA) Survey has
discovered a nearby galaxy, ALFA ZOA J1952+1428, at a heliocentric velocity of
+279 km s-1. The galaxy was discovered at low Galactic latitude by 21-cm
emission from neutral hydrogen (Hi). We have obtained follow-up observations
with the EVLA and the 0.9-m SARA optical telescope. The Hi distribution
overlaps an uncataloged, potential optical counterpart. The Hi linear size is
1.4 kpc at our adopted distance of D = 7 Mpc, but the distance estimate is
uncertain as Hubble's law is unreliable at low recessional velocities. The
optical counterpart has mB = 16.9 mag and B - R = 0.1 mag. These
characteristics, including MHI = 107.0 M\odot and LB = 107.5 L\odot, if at 7
Mpc, indicate that this galaxy is a blue compact dwarf, but this remains
uncertain until further follow-up observations are complete. Optical follow-up
observations are ongoing and near infrared follow-up observations have been
scheduled.
