We discuss a classical reinterpretation of quantum-mechanics-based analysis
of classical Markov chains with detailed balance, that is based on the
quantum-classical correspondence. The classical reinterpretation is then used
to demonstrate that it successfully reproduces a sufficient condition for
cooling schedule in classical simulated annealing, which has the
inverse-logarithmic scaling.
