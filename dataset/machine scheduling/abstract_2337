Block projections have been used, in [Eberly et al. 2006], to obtain an
efficient algorithm to find solutions for sparse systems of linear equations. A
bound of softO(n^(2.5)) machine operations is obtained assuming that the input
matrix can be multiplied by a vector with constant-sized entries in softO(n)
machine operations. Unfortunately, the correctness of this algorithm depends on
the existence of efficient block projections, and this has been conjectured. In
this paper we establish the correctness of the algorithm from [Eberly et al.
2006] by proving the existence of efficient block projections over sufficiently
large fields. We demonstrate the usefulness of these projections by deriving
improved bounds for the cost of several matrix problems, considering, in
particular, ``sparse'' matrices that can be be multiplied by a vector using
softO(n) field operations. We show how to compute the inverse of a sparse
matrix over a field F using an expected number of softO(n^(2.27)) operations in
F. A basis for the null space of a sparse matrix, and a certification of its
rank, are obtained at the same cost. An application to Kaltofen and Villard's
Baby-Steps/Giant-Steps algorithms for the determinant and Smith Form of an
integer matrix yields algorithms requiring softO(n^(2.66)) machine operations.
The derived algorithms are all probabilistic of the Las Vegas type.
