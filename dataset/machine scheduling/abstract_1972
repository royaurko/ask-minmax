The DIAlogue MOdel Learning Environment supports an engineering-oriented
approach towards dialogue modelling for a spoken-language interface. Major
steps towards dialogue models is to know about the basic units that are used to
construct a dialogue model and possible sequences. In difference to many other
approaches a set of dialogue acts is not predefined by any theory or manually
during the engineering process, but is learned from data that are available in
an avised spoken dialogue system. The architecture is outlined and the approach
is applied to the domain of appointment scheduling. Even though based on a word
correctness of about 70% predictability of dialogue acts in DIA-MOLE turns out
to be comparable to human-assigned dialogue acts.
