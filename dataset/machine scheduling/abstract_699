The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is an open
source client-server middleware system created to allow projects with large
computational requirements, usually set in the scientific domain, to utilize a
technically unlimited number of volunteer machines distributed over large
physical distances. However various problems exist deploying applications over
these heterogeneous machines using BOINC: applications must be ported to each
machine architecture type, the project server must be trusted to supply
authentic applications, applications that do not regularly checkpoint may lose
execution progress upon volunteer machine termination and applications that
have dependencies may find it difficult to run under BOINC.
  To solve such problems we introduce virtual BOINC, or V-BOINC, where virtual
machines are used to run computations on volunteer machines. Application
developers can then compile their applications on a single architecture,
checkpointing issues are solved through virtualization API's and many security
concerns are addressed via the virtual machine's sandbox environment. In this
paper we focus on outlining a unique approach on how virtualization can be
introduced into BOINC and demonstrate that V-BOINC offers acceptable
computational performance when compared to regular BOINC. Finally we show that
applications with dependencies can easily run under V-BOINC in turn increasing
the computational potential volunteer computing offers to the general public
and project developers.
