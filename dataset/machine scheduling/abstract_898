In this work we show the existence of traversable wormhole and time-machine
solutions in a modified theory of gravity where matter and curvature are
nonminimally coupled. Those solutions present a nontrivial redshift function
and exist even in the presence of ordinary matter which satisfies the dominant
energy condition.
