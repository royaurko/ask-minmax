This paper presents a parametric stiffness analysis of the Orthoglide. A
compliant modeling and a symbolic expression of the stiffness matrix are
conducted. This allows a simple systematic analysis of the influence of the
geometric design parameters and to quickly identify the critical link
parameters. Our symbolic model is used to display the stiffest areas of the
workspace for a specific machining task. Our approach can be applied to any
parallel manipulator for which stiffness is a critical issue.
