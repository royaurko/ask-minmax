We examine the groundstate properties of the crossover between BCS
superconductivity and Bose Einstein condensation within a model which exhibits
$d_{x^{2} - y^{2}}$ pairing symmetry. We compare results for zero temperature
with known features of s-wave systems and show that bosonic degrees of freedom
are likely to emerge only in the dilute limit. We relate the change in
properties of the groundstate as a function of density to the effect of the
exclusion principle and show that the one particle distribution function
undergoes a significant change when bosonic behavior appears.
