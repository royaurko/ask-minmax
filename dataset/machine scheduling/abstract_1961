Abridged Abstract -
  Utilizing the FORS2 instrument on the VLT, we have obtained near infrared
spectra for more than 200 stars in 28 populous LMC clusters. This cluster
sample spans a large range of ages (~ 1-13 Gyr) and metallicities (-0.3 >
[Fe/H] > -2.0) and has good areal coverage of the LMC disk. The strong
absorption lines of the Calcium II triplet are used to derive cluster radial
velocities and abundances. We determine mean cluster velocities to typically
1.6 km/s and mean metallicities to 0.04 dex (random error). For eight of these
clusters, we report the first spectroscopically determined metallicities based
on individual cluster stars, and six of these eight have no published radial
velocity measurements.
