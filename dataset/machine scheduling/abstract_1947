We present the optical spectra and simple statistical analysis for a complete
sample of 110 soft X-ray selected AGN. About half of the sources are
Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), which have the steepest X-ray spectra,
strongest FeII emission and slightly weaker [OIII]5007 emission than broad line
Seyfert 1s (BLS1s).
 Kolmogorov Smirnov tests show that NLS1s and BLS1s have clearly different
distributions of the X-ray spectral slope, X-ray short-term variability, and
FeII equivalent widths and luminosity and FeII/H-beta ratios. The differences
in the [OIII]/H-beta and [OIII] equivalent widths are only marginal. We found
no significant differences between NLS1s and BLS1s in their rest frame 0.2-2.0
X-ray luminosities, rest frame 5100A monochromatic luminosities, bolometric
luminosities, redshifts, and their H$\beta$ equivalent widths.
