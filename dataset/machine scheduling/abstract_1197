Daya Bay Neutrino Experiment is dedicated to measuring the last unobserved
neutrino mixing angle theta_13. The predicted precision on sin^2(2theta_13) is
0.01 at 90% confidence level. This document briefly reviews the measurement
method and detector construction status. The first two anti-neutrino detectors'
dry run result is also discussed. The Daya Bay near hall data taking is
expected to commence in the summer of 2011 and the data taking of all of the
three halls in the summer of 2012.
