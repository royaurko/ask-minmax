It has been proved that large scale realistic Knowledge Based Machine
Translation applications require acquisition of huge knowledge about language
and about the world. This knowledge is encoded in computational grammars,
lexicons and domain models. Another approach which avoids the need for
collecting and analyzing massive knowledge, is the Example Based approach,
which is the topic of this paper. We show through the paper that using Example
Based in its native form is not suitable for translating into Arabic. Therefore
a modification to the basic approach is presented to improve the accuracy of
the translation process. The basic idea of the new approach is to improve the
technique by which template-based approaches select the appropriate templates.
