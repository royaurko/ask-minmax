We expand the item response theory to study the case of "cheating students"
for a set of exams, trying to detect them by applying a greedy algorithm of
inference. This extended model is closely related to the Boltzmann machine
learning. In this paper we aim to infer the correct biases and interactions of
our model by considering a relatively small number of sets of training data.
Nevertheless, the greedy algorithm that we employed in the present study
exhibits good performance with a few number of training data. The key point is
the sparseness of the interactions in our problem in the context of the
Boltzmann machine learning: the existence of cheating students is expected to
be very rare (possibly even in real world). We compare a standard approach to
infer the sparse interactions in the Boltzmann machine learning to our greedy
algorithm and we find the latter to be superior in several aspects.
