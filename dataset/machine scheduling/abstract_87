The multiprocessor Fixed-Job Priority (FJP) scheduling of real-time systems
is studied. An important property for the schedulability analysis, the
predictability (regardless to the execution times), is studied for
heterogeneous multiprocessor platforms. Our main contribution is to show that
any FJP schedulers are predictable on unrelated platforms. A convenient
consequence is the fact that any FJP schedulers are predictable on uniform
multiprocessors.
