This article presents the Orthoglide project. The purpose of this project is
the realization of a prototype of machine tool to three degrees of translation.
The characteristic of this machine is a parallel kinematic architecture
optimized to obtain a compact workspace with homogeneous performance. For that,
the principal criterion of design which was used is the isotropy.
