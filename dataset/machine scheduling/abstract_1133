Using group theory we classify the nonlinear magneto-optical response at
low-index surfaces of fcc antiferromagnets, such as NiO. Structures consisting
of one atomic layer are discussed in detail. We find that optical second
harmonic generation is sensitive to surface antiferromagnetism in many cases.
We discuss the influence of a second type of magnetic atoms, and also of a
possible oxygen sublattice distortion on the output signal. Finally, our
symmetry analysis yields the possibility of antiferromagnetic surface domain
imaging even in the presence of magnetic unit-cell doubling.
