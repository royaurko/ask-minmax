The conventional design of cellular systems prescribes the separation of
uplink and downlink transmissions via time-division or frequency-division
duplex. Recent advances in analog and digital domain self-interference
interference cancellation challenge the need for this arrangement and open up
the possibility to operate base stations, especially low-power ones, in a
full-duplex mode. As a means to cope with the resulting downlink-to-uplink
interference among base stations, this letter investigates the impact of the
Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architecture. The analysis follows an
information theoretic approach based on the classical Wyner model. The
analytical results herein confirm the significant potential advantages of the
C-RAN architecture in the presence of full-duplex base stations, as long as
sufficient fronthaul capacity is available and appropriate mobile station
scheduling, or successive interference cancellation at the mobile stations, is
implemented.
