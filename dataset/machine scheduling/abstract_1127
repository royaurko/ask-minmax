In simulations of some infinite range spin glass systems with finite
connectivity, it is found that for any resonable computational time, the
saturatedenergy per spin that is achieved by a cluster algorithm is lowered in
comparison to that achieved by Metropolis dynamics.The gap between the average
energies obtained from these two dynamics is robust with respect to variations
of the annealing schedule. For some probability distribution of the
interactions the ground state energy is calculated analytically within the
replica symmetry assumptionand is found to be saturated by a cluster algorithm.
