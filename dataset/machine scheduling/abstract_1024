This paper deals with a predictive model of kinematical performance in 5-axis
milling within the context of High Speed Machining. Indeed, 5-axis high speed
milling makes it possible to improve quality and productivity thanks to the
degrees of freedom brought by the tool axis orientation. The tool axis
orientation can be set efficiently in terms of productivity by considering
kinematical constraints resulting from the set machine-tool/NC unit. Capacities
of each axis as well as some NC unit functions can be expressed as limiting
constraints. The proposed model relies on each axis displacement in the joint
space of the machine-tool and predicts the most limiting axis for each
trajectory segment. Thus, the calculation of the tool feedrate can be performed
highlighting zones for which the programmed feedrate is not reached. This
constitutes an indicator for trajectory optimization. The efficiency of the
model is illustrated through examples. Finally, the model could be used for
optimizing process planning.
