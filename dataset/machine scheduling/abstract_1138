We study the depinning transition of driven interfaces in thin ferromagnetic
films driven by external magnetic fields. Approaching the transition point the
correlation length increases with decreasing driving. If the correlation length
becomes of the order of the film thickness a crossover to two dimensional
behavior occurs. From the corresponding scaling analysis we determine the
exponents characterizing the transition of the three dimensional system.
