HTCondor is a distributed job scheduler developed by the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, which allows users to run their applications in other users'
machines when they are not being used, thus providing a considerably increase
in the overall computational power and a more efficient use of the computing
resources. Our institution has been successfully using HTCondor for more than
ten years, and HTCondor is nowadays the most used Supercomputing resource we
have. Although HTCondor provides a wide range of tools and options for its
management and administration, there are currently no tools that can show
detailed usage information and statistics in a clear, easy to interpret,
interactive set of graphics displays. For this reason, we have developed
ConGUSTo, a web-based tool that allows to collect HTCondor usage and statistics
data in an easy way, and present them using a variety of tabular and graphics
charts.
