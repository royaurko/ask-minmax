We study how the paradigm of Newton's science, based on the organization of
scientific knowledge as a series of mathematical laws, was definitively
accepted in science courses - in the last decades of the XVIII century, in
England as well as in the Continent - by means of the "universal" dynamical
machine invented by George Atwood in late 1770s just for this purpose. The
spreading of such machine, occurred well before the appearance of Atwood's
treatise where he described the novel machine and the experiments to be
performed with it, is a quite interesting historical case, which we consider in
some detail. In particular, we focus on the "improvement" introduced by the
Italian Giuseppe Saverio Poli and the subsequent "simplifications" of the
machine, underlying the ongoing change of perspective after the definitive
success of Newtonianism. The case studied here allows to recognize the relevant
role played by a properly devised instrument in the acceptance of a new
paradigm by non-erudite scholars, in addition to the traditional ways involving
erudite scientists, and thus the complementary role of machine philosophy with
respect to mathematical, philosophical or even physical reasoning.
