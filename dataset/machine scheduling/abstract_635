The Chomsky hierarchy plays a prominent role in the foundations of the
theoretical computer science relating classes of formal languages of primary
importance. In this paper we use recent developments on coalgebraic and
monad-based semantics to obtain a generic notion of a $\mathbb{T}$-automaton,
where $\mathbb{T}$ is a monad, which allows the uniform study of various
notions of machines (e.g. finite state machines, multi-stack machines, Turing
machines, valence automata, weighted automata). We use the generalized powerset
construction to define a generic (trace) semantics for $\mathbb{T}$-automata,
and we show by numerous examples that it correctly instantiates for the known
classes of machines/languages captured by the Chomsky hierarchy. Moreover, our
approach provides new generic techniques for proving expressivity bounds of
various machine-based models.
