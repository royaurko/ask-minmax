The upcoming muon (g-2) experiment at Fermilab will measure the anomalous
magnetic moment of the muon to a relative precision of 140 ppb, 4 times better
than the previous experiment at BNL. The new experiment is motivated by the
persistent 3-4 standard deviations difference between the experimental value
and the Standard Model prediction, and it will have the statistical sensitivity
necessary to either refute the claim or confirm it with a confidence level
exceeding a discovery threshold. The experiment is under construction and
scheduled to start running in early 2017.
