Weakly acyclic games form a natural generalization of the class of games that
have the finite improvement property (FIP). In such games one stipulates that
from any initial joint strategy some finite improvement path exists. We
classify weakly acyclic games using the concept of a scheduler introduced in
arXiv:1202.2209. We also show that finite games that can be solved by the
iterated elimination of never best response strategies are weakly acyclic.
Finally, we explain how the schedulers allow us to improve the bounds on
finding a Nash equilibrium in a weakly acyclic game.
