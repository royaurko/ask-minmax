A new density functional theory (DFT) exchange-correlation functional for the
exploration of reaction mechanisms is proposed. This new functional, denoted
BMK (Boese-Martin for Kinetics), has an accuracy in the 2 kcal/mol range for
transition state barriers but, unlike previous attempts at such a functional,
this improved accuracy does not come at the expense of equilibrium properties.
This makes it a general-purpose functional whose domain of applicability has
been extended to transition states, rather than a specialized functional for
kinetics. The improvement in BMK rests on the inclusion of the kinetic energy
density together with a large value of the exact exchange mixing coefficient.
For this functional, the kinetic energy density appears to correct `back' the
excess exact exchange mixing for ground-state properties, possibly simulating
variable exchange.
