Steady state dynamics of clustering, long range order, and inelastic collapse
are experimentally observed in vertically shaken granular monolayers. At large
vibration amplitudes, particle correlations show only short range order like
equilibrium 2D hard sphere gases. Lowering the amplitude "cools" the system,
resulting in a dramatic increase in correlations leading either to clustering
or an ordered state. Further cooling forms a collapse: a condensate of
motionless balls co-existing with a less dense gas. Measured velocity
distributions are non-Gaussian, showing nearly exponential tails.
