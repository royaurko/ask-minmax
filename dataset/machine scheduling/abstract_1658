To save cost, recently more and more users choose to provision virtual
machine resources in cluster systems, especially in data centres. Maintaining a
consistent member view is the foundation of reliable cluster managements, and
it also raises several challenge issues for large scale cluster systems
deployed with virtual machines (which we call virtualized clusters). In this
paper, we introduce our experiences in design and implementation of scalable
member view management on large-scale virtual clusters. Our research
contributions are three-fold: 1) we propose a scalable and reliable management
infrastructure that combines a peer-to-peer structure and a hierarchy structure
to maintain a consistent member view in virtual clusters; 2) we present a
light-weighted group membership algorithm that can reach the consistent member
view within a single round of message exchange; and 3) we design and implement
a scalable membership service that can provision virtual machines and maintain
a consistent member view in virtual clusters. Our work is verified on Dawning
5000A, which ranked No.10 of Top 500 super computers in November, 2008.
