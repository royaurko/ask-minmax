In this paper we have used one 2 variable Boolean function called Rule 6 to
define another beautiful transformation named as Extended Rule-6. Using this
function we have explored the algebraic beauties and its application to an
efficient Round Robin Tournament (RRT) routine for 2k (k is any natural number)
number of teams. At the end, we have thrown some light towards any number of
teams of the form nk where n, k are natural numbers.
