The trend for cloud computing has initiated a race towards data centres (DC)
of an ever-increasing size. The largest DCs now contain many hundreds of
thousands of virtual machine (VM) services. Given the finite lifespan of
hardware, such large DCs are subject to frequent hardware failure events that
can lead to disruption of service. To counter this, multiple redundant copies
of task threads may be distributed around a DC to ensure that individual
hardware failures do not cause entire jobs to fail. Here, we present results
demonstrating the resilience of different job scheduling algorithms in a
simulated DC with hardware failure. We use a simple model of jobs distributed
across a hardware network to demonstrate the relationship between resilience
and additional communication costs of different scheduling methods.
