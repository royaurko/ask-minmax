Early scheduling algorithms usually adjusted the clock cycle duration to the
execution time of the slowest operation. This resulted in large slack times
wasted in those cycles executing faster operations. To reduce the wasted times
multi-cycle and chaining techniques have been employed. While these techniques
have produced successful designs, its effectiveness is often limited due to the
area increment that may derive from chaining, and the extra latencies that may
derive from multicycling. In this paper we present an optimization method that
solves the time-constrained scheduling problem by transforming behavioural
specifications into new ones whose subsequent synthesis substantially improves
circuit performance. Our proposal breaks up some of the specification
operations, allowing their execution during several possibly unconsecutive
cycles, and also the calculation of several data-dependent operation fragments
in the same cycle. To do so, it takes into account the circuit latency and the
execution time of every specification operation. The experimental results
carried out show that circuits obtained from the optimized specification are on
average 60% faster than those synthesized from the original specification, with
only slight increments in the circuit area.
