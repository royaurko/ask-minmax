Knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT) techniques yield high quality in
domains with detailed semantic models, limited vocabulary, and controlled input
grammar. Scaling up along these dimensions means acquiring large knowledge
resources. It also means behaving reasonably when definitive knowledge is not
yet available. This paper describes how we can fill various KBMT knowledge
gaps, often using robust statistical techniques. We describe quantitative and
qualitative results from JAPANGLOSS, a broad-coverage Japanese-English MT
system.
