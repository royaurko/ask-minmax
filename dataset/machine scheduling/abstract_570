In this brief note, we show that chaotic Boltzmann machines truly yield
samples from the probabilistic distribution of the corresponding Boltzmann
machines if they are composed of only two elements. This note is an English
translation (with slight modifications) of the article originally written in
Japanese [H. Suzuki, Seisan Kenkyu 66 (2014), 315-316].
