We describe in a rudimentary fashion how SVM(support vector machine) plays
the role of classifier in a mathematical setting. We then discuss its
application in the study of multiple SNP(single nucleotide polymorphism)
variations. Also presented is a set of preliminary test results with clinical
data.
