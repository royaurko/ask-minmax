We report on the fabrication and electrical characterization of field-effect
transistors at the surface of tetracene single crystals. We find that the
mobility of these transistors reaches the room-temperature value of $0.4 \
cm^2/Vs$. The non-monotonous temperature dependence of the mobility, its weak
gate voltage dependence, as well as the sharpness of the subthreshold slope
confirm the high quality of single-crystal devices. This is due to the
fabrication process that does not substantially affect the crystal quality.
