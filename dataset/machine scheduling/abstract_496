We consider joint scheduling and diversity to enhance the benefits of
multiuser diversity in an \OFDMA{} system. The \OFDMA{} spectrum is assumed to
consist of $\Nrb$ resource blocks and the reduced feedback scheme consists of
each user feeding back channel quality information (\CQI) for only the
best-$\NFb$ resource blocks. Assuming largest normalized \CQI{} scheduling and
a general value for $\NFb$, we develop a unified framework to analyze the sum
rate of the system for both the quantized and non-quantized \CQI{} feedback
schemes. Based on this framework, we provide closed-form expressions for the
sum rate for three different multi-antenna transmitter schemes; Transmit
antenna selection (\TAS), orthogonal space time block codes (\OSTBC) and cyclic
delay diversity (\CDD). Furthermore, we approximate the sum rate expression and
determine the feedback ratio $(\frac{\NFb}{\Nrb})$ required to achieve a sum
rate comparable to the sum rate obtained by a full feedback scheme.
