The stability of scheduled multiaccess communication with random coding and
independent decoding of messages is investigated. The number of messages that
may be scheduled for simultaneous transmission is limited to a given maximum
value, and the channels from transmitters to receiver are quasi-static, flat,
and have independent fades. Requests for message transmissions are assumed to
arrive according to an i.i.d. arrival process. Then, we show the following: (1)
in the limit of large message alphabet size, the stability region has an
interference limited information-theoretic capacity interpretation, (2)
state-independent scheduling policies achieve this asymptotic stability region,
and (3) in the asymptotic limit corresponding to immediate access, the
stability region for non-idling scheduling policies is shown to be identical
irrespective of received signal powers.
