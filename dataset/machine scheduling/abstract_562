A set of examples is provided that illustrate the use of work as applied to
simple machines. The ramp, pulley, lever and hydraulic press are common
experiences in the life of a student and their theoretical analysis therefore
makes the abstract concept of work more real. The mechanical advantage of each
of these systems is also discussed so that students can evaluate their
usefulness as machines.
