Irrespective of local conditions imposed on the metric, any extendible
spacetime U has a maximal extension containing no closed causal curves outside
the chronological past of U. We prove this fact and interpret it as
impossibility (in classical general relativity) of the time machines, insofar
as the latter are defined to be causality-violating regions created by human
beings (as opposed to those appearing spontaneously).
