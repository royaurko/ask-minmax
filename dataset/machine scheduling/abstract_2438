An equilibrium reversible cycle with a certain engine to transduce the energy
of any chemical reaction into mechanical energy is proposed. The efficiency for
chemical energy transduction is also defined so as to be compared with Carnot
efficiency. Relevance to the study of protein motors is discussed. KEYWORDS:
Chemical thermodynamics, Engine, Efficiency, Molecular machine.
