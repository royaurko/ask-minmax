This paper presents a machine learning approach for identification of Bengali
multiword expressions (MWE) which are bigram nominal compounds. Our proposed
approach has two steps: (1) candidate extraction using chunk information and
various heuristic rules and (2) training the machine learning algorithm called
Random Forest to classify the candidates into two groups: bigram nominal
compound MWE or not bigram nominal compound MWE. A variety of association
measures, syntactic and linguistic clues and a set of WordNet-based similarity
features have been used for our MWE identification task. The approach presented
in this paper can be used to identify bigram nominal compound MWE in Bengali
running text.
