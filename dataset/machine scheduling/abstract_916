In this technical report we presented a novel approach to machine learning.
Once the new framework is presented, we will provide a simple and yet very
powerful learning algorithm which will be benchmark on various dataset.
  The framework we proposed is based on booleen circuits; more specifically the
classifier produced by our algorithm have that form. Using bits and boolean
gates instead of real numbers and multiplication enable the the learning
algorithm and classifier to use very efficient boolean vector operations. This
enable both the learning algorithm and classifier to be extremely efficient.
The accuracy of the classifier we obtain with our framework compares very
favorably those produced by conventional techniques, both in terms of
efficiency and accuracy.
