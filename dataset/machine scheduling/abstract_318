We consider stability of scheduled multiaccess message communication with
random coding and joint maximum-likehood decoding of messages. The framework we
consider here models both the random message arrivals and the subsequent
reliable communication by suitably combining techniques from queueing theory
and information theory. The number of messages that may be scheduled for
simultaneous transmission is limited to a given maximum value, and the channels
from transmitters to receiver are quasi-static, flat, and have independent
fades. Requests for message transmissions are assumed to arrive according to an
i.i.d. arrival process. Then, (i) we derive an outer bound to the region of
message arrival rate vectors achievable by the class of stationary scheduling
policies, (ii) we show for any message arrival rate vector that satisfies the
outerbound, that there exists a stationary state-independent policy that
results in a stable system for the corresponding message arrival process, and
(iii) in the limit of large message lengths, we show that the stability region
of message nat arrival rate vectors has information-theoretic capacity region
interpretation.
