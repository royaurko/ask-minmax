This paper shows the baseline LHC machine parameters for the 2015 start-up.
Many systems have been upgraded during LS1 and in 2015 the LHC will operate at
a higher energy than before and with a tighter filling scheme. Therefore, the
2015 commissioning phase risks to be less smooth than in 2012. The proposed
starting configuration puts the focus on feasibility rather than peak
performance and includes margins for operational uncertainties. Instead, once
beam experience and a better machine knowledge has been obtained, a push in
$\beta^*$ and performance can be envisaged. In this paper, the focus is on
collimation settings and reach in $\beta^*$---other parameters are covered in
greater depth by other papers in these proceedings.
