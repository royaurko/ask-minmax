We study two operational schemes for a coherent Ising machine based on an
injection-locked laser network. These schemes gradually increase the pumping
rate or the mutual coupling among the slave lasers. We numerically simulate the
two schemes against a data search problem implemented with the Ising model in
cubic graphs without frustration. We show the machine can achieve a better
success probability and effective computational time to find a target/ground
state with these gradual schemes than those with the abrupt introduction of the
mutual injection which has been studied previously. The computational time
simulated with typical parameters is almost constant up to the problem size M =
200 and turns into a nearly linear scale holding up to M = 1000.
