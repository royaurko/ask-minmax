We present OH and H I Zeeman observations of the NGC 6334 complex taken with
the Very Large Array. The OH absorption profiles associated with the complex
are relatively narrow (del-v_FWHM ~ 3 km s^1) and single-peaked over most of
the sources. The H I absorption profiles contain several blended velocity
components. One of the compact continuum sources in the complex (source A) has
a bipolar morphology. The OH absorption profiles toward this source display a
gradient in velocity from the northern continuum lobe to the southern continuum
lobe; this velocity gradient likely indicates a bipolar outflow of molecular
gas from the central regions to the northern and southern lobes. Magnetic
fields of the order of 200 microG have been detected toward three discrete
continuum sources in the complex. Virial estimates suggest that the detected
magnetic fields in these sources are of the same order as the critical magnetic
fields required to support the molecular clouds associated with the sources
against gravitational collapse.
