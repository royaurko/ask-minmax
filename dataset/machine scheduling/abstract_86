Scheduling in Grid computing has been active area of research since its
beginning. However, beginners find very difficult to understand related
concepts due to a large learning curve of Grid computing. Thus, there is a need
of concise understanding of scheduling in Grid computing area. This paper
strives to present concise understanding of scheduling and related
understanding of Grid computing system. The paper describes overall picture of
Grid computing and discusses important sub-systems that enable Grid computing
possible. Moreover, the paper also discusses concepts of resource scheduling
and application scheduling and also presents classification of scheduling
algorithms. Furthermore, the paper also presents methodology used for
evaluating scheduling algorithms including both real system and simulation
based approaches. The presented work on scheduling in Grid containing concise
understandings of scheduling system, scheduling algorithm, and scheduling
methodology would be very useful to users and researchers
