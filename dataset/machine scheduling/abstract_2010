The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), scheduled to start operation in 2006, is
foreseen to provide in the first year of running a total of $\sim 10^{12}$
$\tau$ leptons. CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) is a general-purpose experiment
designed to study proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions at LHC. Even if the
Susy particles and Higgs searches togheter with the B-physics present its main
goal, the large amount of $\tau$-lepton, could allow a systematic study of
tau-physics. We have performed a full simulation of CMS using GEANT 3 package
and the object-oriented reconstruction program ORCA to study the sensitivity to
neutrinoless tau decay $\tau \to \mu^+ \mu^- \mu^- $ and $\tau \to \mu \gamma$.
We present the analysis developed for these channels and the results obtained.
