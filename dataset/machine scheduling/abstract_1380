This paper addresses the workspace analysis of the orthoglide, a 3-DOF
parallel mechanism designed for machining applications. This machine features
three fixed parallel linear joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile
platform which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The
workspace analysis is conducted on the bases of prescribed kinetostatic
performances. The interesting features of the orthoglide are a regular
Cartesian workspace shape, uniform performances in all directions and good
compactness. Interval analysis based methods for computing the dextrous
workspace and the largest cube enclosed in this workspace are presented.
