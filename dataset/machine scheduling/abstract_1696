A predictive control scheme for a permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM)
is presented. It is based on a suboptimal method for computationally efficient
trajectory generation based on continuous parameterization and linear
programming. The torque controller optimizes a quadratic cost consisting of
control error and machine losses in real-time respecting voltage and current
limitations. The multivariable controller decouples the two current components
and exploits cross-coupling effects in the long-range constrained predictive
control strategy. The optimization results in fast and smooth torque dynamics
while inherently using field-weakening to improve the power efficiency and the
current dynamics in high speed operation. The performance of the scheme is
demonstrated by experimental results.
