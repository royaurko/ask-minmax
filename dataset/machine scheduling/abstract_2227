We introduce a new class of games, called social contribution games (SCGs),
where each player's individual cost is equal to the cost he induces on society
because of his presence. Our results reveal that SCGs constitute useful
abstractions of altruistic games when it comes to the analysis of the robust
price of anarchy. We first show that SCGs are altruism-independently smooth,
i.e., the robust price of anarchy of these games remains the same under
arbitrary altruistic extensions. We then devise a general reduction technique
that enables us to reduce the problem of establishing smoothness for an
altruistic extension of a base game to a corresponding SCG. Our reduction
applies whenever the base game relates to a canonical SCG by satisfying a
simple social contribution boundedness property. As it turns out, several
well-known games satisfy this property and are thus amenable to our reduction
technique. Examples include min-sum scheduling games, congestion games, second
price auctions and valid utility games. Using our technique, we derive mostly
tight bounds on the robust price of anarchy of their altruistic extensions. For
the majority of the mentioned game classes, the results extend to the more
differentiated friendship setting. As we show, our reduction technique covers
this model if the base game satisfies three additional natural properties.
