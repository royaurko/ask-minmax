Cyber-physical systems (CPS) can be viewed as a new generation of systems
with integrated control, communication and computational capabilities. Like the
internet transformed how humans interact with one another, cyber-physical
systems will transform how people interact with the physical world. Currently,
the study of CPS is still in its infancy and there exist many research issues
and challenges ranging from electricity power, health care, transportation and
smart building etc. In this paper, an introduction of CPeSC3 (cyber physical
enhanced secured wireless sensor networks (WSNs) integrated cloud computing for
u-life care) architecture and its application to the health care monitoring and
decision support systems is given. The proposed CPeSC3 architecture is composed
of three main components, namely 1) communication core, 2) computation core,
and 3) resource scheduling and management core. Detailed analysis and
explanation are given for relevant models such as cloud computing, real time
scheduling and security models. Finally, a medical health care application
scenario is presented based on our practical test-bed which has been built for
3 years.
