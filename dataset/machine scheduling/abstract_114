This paper deals with the study of Earliest Deadline First (EDF) which is an
optimal scheduling algorithm for uniprocessor real time systems use for
scheduling the periodic task in soft real-time multiprocessor systems. In hard
real-time systems, a significant disparity exists EDF-based schemes and RMA
scheduling (which is the only known way of optimally scheduling recurrent
real-time tasks on multiprocessors): on M processors, all known EDF variants
have utilization-based schedulability bounds of approximately M/2, while RMA
algorithms can fully utilize all processors. This is unfortunate because EDF
based algorithms entail lower scheduling and task migration overheads. In work
on hard real-time systems, it has been shown that this disparity in
Schedulability can be lessened by placing caps on per task utilizations. Our
main contribution is a new EDF based scheme that ensures bounded deadline
tardiness. In this scheme, per-task utilizations must be focused,but overall
utilization need not be stricted. Our scheme should enable a wide range of soft
real-time applications to be scheduled with no constraints on total
utilization. Also propose techniques and heuristics that can be used to reduce
tardiness as well as increase the efficiency of task.
