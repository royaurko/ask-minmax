We prove that the maximum speed and the entropy of a one-tape Turing machine
are computable, in the sense that we can approximate them to any given
precision $\epsilon$. This is contrary to popular belief, as all dynamical
properties are usually undecidable for Turing machines. The result is quite
specific to one-tape Turing machines, as it is not true anymore for two-tape
Turing machines by the results of Blondel et al., and uses the approach of
crossing sequences introduced by Hennie.
