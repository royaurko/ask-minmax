Successive cancellation (SC) is the first and widely known decoder of polar
codes, which has received a lot of attentions recently. However, its decoding
schedule generating algorithms are still primitive, which are not only complex
but also offline. This paper proposes a simple and online algorithm to generate
the decoding schedule of SC decoder. Firstly, the dependencies among likelihood
ratios (LR) are explored, which lead to the discovery of a sharing factor.
Secondly, based on the online calculation of the sharing factor, the proposed
algorithm is presented, which is neither based on the depth-first traversal of
the scheduling tree nor based on the recursive construction. As shown by the
comparisons among the proposed algorithm and existed algorithms, the proposed
algorithm has advantages of the online feature and the far less memory taken by
the decoding schedule.
