Machine transliteration is a method for automatically converting words in one
language into phonetically equivalent ones in another language. Machine
transliteration plays an important role in natural language applications such
as information retrieval and machine translation, especially for handling
proper nouns and technical terms. Four machine transliteration models --
grapheme-based transliteration model, phoneme-based transliteration model,
hybrid transliteration model, and correspondence-based transliteration model --
have been proposed by several researchers. To date, however, there has been
little research on a framework in which multiple transliteration models can
operate simultaneously. Furthermore, there has been no comparison of the four
models within the same framework and using the same data. We addressed these
problems by 1) modeling the four models within the same framework, 2) comparing
them under the same conditions, and 3) developing a way to improve machine
transliteration through this comparison. Our comparison showed that the hybrid
and correspondence-based models were the most effective and that the four
models can be used in a complementary manner to improve machine transliteration
performance.
