The technical report presents a generic exact solution approach for
minimizing the project duration of the resource-constrained project scheduling
problem with generalized precedences (Rcpsp/max). The approach uses lazy clause
generation, i.e., a hybrid of finite domain and Boolean satisfiability solving,
in order to apply nogood learning and conflict-driven search on the solution
generation. Our experiments show the benefit of lazy clause generation for
finding an optimal solutions and proving its optimality in comparison to other
state-of-the-art exact and non-exact methods. The method is highly robust: it
matched or bettered the best known results on all of the 2340 instances we
examined except 3, according to the currently available data on the PSPLib. Of
the 631 open instances in this set it closed 573 and improved the bounds of 51
of the remaining 58 instances.
