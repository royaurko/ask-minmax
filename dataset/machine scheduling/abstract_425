We have developped a new method for the scheduling of astronomical automatic
telescopes, in the framework of the autonomous TAROT instrument. The MAJORDOME
software can handle a variety of observations, constrained, periodic, etc., and
produces a timeline for the night, which may be modified at any time to take
into account the specific conditions of the night. The MAJORDOME can also
handle target of opportunity observations without delay.
