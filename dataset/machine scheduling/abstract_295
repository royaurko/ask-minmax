In this paper, we devise a scheduling algorithm for ordering transmission of
synchrophasor data from the substation to the control center in as short a time
frame as possible, within the realtime hierarchical communications
infrastructure in the electric grid. The problem is cast in the framework of
the classic job scheduling with precedence constraints. The optimization setup
comprises the number of phasor measurement units (PMUs) to be installed on the
grid, a weight associated with each PMU, processing time at the control center
for the PMUs, and precedence constraints between the PMUs. The solution to the
PMU placement problem yields the optimum number of PMUs to be installed on the
grid, while the processing times are picked uniformly at random from a
predefined set. The weight associated with each PMU and the precedence
constraints are both assumed known. The scheduling problem is provably NP-hard,
so we resort to approximation algorithms which provide solutions that are
suboptimal yet possessing polynomial time complexity. A lower bound on the
optimal schedule is derived using branch and bound techniques, and its
performance evaluated using standard IEEE test bus systems. The scheduling
policy is power grid-centric, since it takes into account the electrical
properties of the network under consideration.
