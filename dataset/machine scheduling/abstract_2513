Fano varieties are subvarieties of the Grassmannian whose points parametrize
linear subspaces contained in a given projective variety. These expository
notes give an account of results on Fano varieties of complete intersections,
with a view toward an application in machine learning. The prerequisites have
been kept to a minimum in order to make these results accessible to a broad
audience.
