Lobster-ISS is a revolutionary astrophysical X-ray all-sky monitor scheduled
for deployment as an attached payload on the International Space Station (ISS)
in 2009. Using a new wide field-of-view focusing optic, Lobster-ISS provides an
order-of-magnitude improvement in the sensitivity of all-sky monitors in the
soft X-ray band (0.1-3.0 keV). This lobster-eye optic presents unique
challenges to the imaging X-ray detector at its focus. Micro-patterned imaging
proportional counters, with thier mechanical simplicity and high performance,
are the most practical means of meeting the requirements. We describe our
design for the Lobster-ISS imaging detector based on direct-imaging micro-well
proportional counters and the expected performance.
