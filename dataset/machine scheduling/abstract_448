In this paper, we design an efficient algorithm for the energy-aware profit
maximizing scheduling problem, where the high performance computing system
administrator is to maximize the profit per unit time. The running time of the
proposed algorithm is depending on the number of task types, while the running
time of the previous algorithm is depending on the number of tasks. Moreover,
we prove that the worst-case performance ratio is close to 2, which maybe the
best result. Simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm is more
accurate than the previous method.
