This paper comments on the published work dealing with robustness and
regularization of support vector machines (Journal of Machine Learning
Research, vol. 10, pp. 1485-1510, 2009) [arXiv:0803.3490] by H. Xu, etc. They
proposed a theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the
feature space and robustness in the sample space directly. In this paper, we
propose a counter example that rejects their theorem.
