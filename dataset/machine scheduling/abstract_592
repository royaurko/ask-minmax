We prove the Extended Church-Turing Thesis: Every effective algorithm can be
efficiently simulated by a Turing machine. This is accomplished by emulating an
effective algorithm via an abstract state machine, and simulating such an
abstract state machine by a random access machine, representing data as a
minimal term graph.
