We apply Uppaal Tiga to automatically compute adaptive scheduling strategies
for an industrial case study dealing with a state-of-the-art image processing
pipeline of a printer. As far as we know, this is the first application of
timed automata technology to an industrial scheduling problem with uncertainty
in job arrivals.
