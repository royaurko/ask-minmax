The injector linacs of the JLC/NLC project include the prelinac, the e+ drive
linac, the $e- booster, and the $e+ booster. The first three will be S-band
machines, the last one, an L-band machine. We have demonstrated that by using
detuning alone in the accelerator structure design of these linacs we will have
acceptable tolerances for emittance growth due to both injection jitter and
structure misalignments, for both the nominal (2.8ns) and alternate (1.4ns)
bunch spacings.
