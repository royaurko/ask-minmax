Virtualization is a framework of dividing the resources of a computer into
multiple execution environments which offers a lot of benefits including
flexibility, security, ease to configuration and reduction of cost but at the
same time it also brings a certain degree of performance overhead. Furthermore,
Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) is the core component of virtual machine (VM)
system and its effectiveness greatly impacts the performance of the whole
system. This review paper will try to describe the basic knowledge about
various virtual machine monitors such as VMware and VirtualBox. It also
discussed and explores the benchmark LINPACK and CloudSim available for cloud
computing. This benchmark and CloudSim can be used to measure the performance
of two different virtual machine monitors in terms of processing speed, time,
bandwidth, quality and response of the cloud computing network.
