We develop and implement in this paper a fast sparse assembly algorithm, the
fundamental operation which creates a compressed matrix from raw index data.
Since it is often a quite demanding and sometimes critical operation, it is of
interest to design a highly efficient implementation. We show how to do this,
and moreover, we show how our implementation can be parallelized to utilize the
power of modern multicore computers. Our freely available code, fully Matlab
compatible, achieves about a factor of 5 times in speedup on a typical 6-core
machine and 10 times on a dual-socket 16 core machine compared to the built-in
serial implementation.
