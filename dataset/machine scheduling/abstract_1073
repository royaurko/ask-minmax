Predicting an individual's risk of experiencing a future clinical outcome is
a statistical task with important consequences for both practicing clinicians
and public health experts. Modern observational databases such as electronic
health records (EHRs) provide an alternative to the longitudinal cohort studies
traditionally used to construct risk models, bringing with them both
opportunities and challenges. Large sample sizes and detailed covariate
histories enable the use of sophisticated machine learning techniques to
uncover complex associations and interactions, but observational databases are
often ``messy,'' with high levels of missing data and incomplete patient
follow-up. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of the well-known Naive
Bayes (NB) machine learning approach for classification to time-to-event
outcomes subject to censoring. We compare the predictive performance of our
method to the Cox proportional hazards model which is commonly used for risk
prediction in healthcare populations, and illustrate its application to
prediction of cardiovascular risk using an EHR dataset from a large Midwest
integrated healthcare system.
