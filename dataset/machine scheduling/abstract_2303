Fault tolerance is a key factor of industrial computing systems design. But
in practical terms, these systems, like every commercial product, are under
great financial constraints and they have to remain in operational state as
long as possible due to their commercial attractiveness. This work provides an
analysis of the instantaneous failure rate of these systems at the end of their
life-time period. On the basis of this analysis, we determine the effect of a
critical increase in the system failure rate and the basic condition of its
existence. The next step determines the maintenance scheduling which can help
to avoid this effect and to extend the system life-time in fault-tolerant mode.
