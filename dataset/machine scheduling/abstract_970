We derive upper and lower bounds for the efficiency of an isothermal
molecular machine operating at maximum power. The upper bound is reached when
the activated state is close to the fueling or reactant state (Eyring-like),
while the lower bound is reached when the activated state is close to the
product state (Kramers-like).
