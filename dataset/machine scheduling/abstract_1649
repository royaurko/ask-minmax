Fuzzy set theory opens new vistas in computability theory and here I show
this by defining a new computational metaphor--the fuzzy chemical metaphor.
This metaphor is an extension of the chemical metaphor. In particular, I
introduce the idea of a state of a system as a solution of fuzzy molecules,
that is molecules that are not just different but rather similar, that react
according to a set of fuzzy reaction rules. These notions become precise by
introducing fuzzy labeled transition systems. Solutions of fuzzy molecules and
fuzzy reaction rules are used to define the general notion of a fuzzy chemical
abstract machine, which is a {\em realization} of the fuzzy chemical metaphor.
Based on the idea that these machines can be used to describe the operational
semantics of process calculi and algebras that include fuzziness as a
fundamental property, I present a toy calculus that is a fuzzy equivalent of
the $\pi$-calculus.
