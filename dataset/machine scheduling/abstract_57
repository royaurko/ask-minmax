Constructing an accurate system model for formal model verification can be
both resource demanding and time-consuming. To alleviate this shortcoming,
algorithms have been proposed for automatically learning system models based on
observed system behaviors. In this paper we extend the algorithm on learning
probabilistic automata to reactive systems, where the observed system behavior
is in the form of alternating sequences of inputs and outputs. We propose an
algorithm for automatically learning a deterministic labeled Markov decision
process model from the observed behavior of a reactive system. The proposed
learning algorithm is adapted from algorithms for learning deterministic
probabilistic finite automata, and extended to include both probabilistic and
nondeterministic transitions. The algorithm is empirically analyzed and
evaluated by learning system models of slot machines. The evaluation is
performed by analyzing the probabilistic linear temporal logic properties of
the system as well as by analyzing the schedulers, in particular the optimal
schedulers, induced by the learned models.
