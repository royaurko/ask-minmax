In this paper, we apply Classification Restricted Boltzmann Machine
(ClassRBM) to the problem of predicting breast cancer recurrence. According to
the Polish National Cancer Registry, in 2010 only, the breast cancer caused
almost 25% of all diagnosed cases of cancer in Poland. We propose how to use
ClassRBM for predicting breast cancer return and discovering relevant inputs
(symptoms) in illness reappearance. Next, we outline a general probabilistic
framework for learning Boltzmann machines with masks, which we refer to as
Dropping. The fashion of generating masks leads to different learning methods,
i.e., DropOut, DropConnect. We propose a new method called DropPart which is a
generalization of DropConnect. In DropPart the Beta distribution instead of
Bernoulli distribution in DropConnect is used. At the end, we carry out an
experiment using real-life dataset consisting of 949 cases, provided by the
Institute of Oncology Ljubljana.
