In 2008 the LHC saw a series of injection tests with beam and the start of
full beam commissioning. Initial beam commissioning went well and circulating
beam was quickly established. Progress was unfortunately curtailed by the
sector 34 incident which caused extensive damage. The causes of the incident
are recalled and the status of repairs and consolidation measures are
presented. The schedule and luminosity targets for the 2009 - 2010 run are
discussed.
