The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a semantic network data model
that is used to create machine-understandable descriptions of the world and is
the basis of the Semantic Web. This article discusses the application of RDF to
the representation of computer software and virtual computing machines. The
Semantic Web is posited as not only a web of data, but also as a web of
programs and processes.
