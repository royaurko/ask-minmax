This paper addresses the workspace analysis of two 3-DOF translational
parallel mechanisms designed for machining applications. The two machines
features three fixed linear joints. The joint axes of the first machine are
orthogonal whereas these of the second are parallel. In both cases, the mobile
platform moves in the Cartesian $x-y-z$ space with fixed orientation. The
workspace analysis is conducted on the basis of prescribed kinetostatic
performances. Interval analysis based methods are used to compute the dextrous
workspace and the largest cube enclosed in this workspace.
