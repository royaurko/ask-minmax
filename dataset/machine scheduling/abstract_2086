The dual-cross scenario of the hybrid wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is
studied and a novel MIMO Cluster Cooperative Assignment Cross Layer Scheduling
Scheme (MCCA-CLSS) is proposed in this paper. The comparison and the
predominance of the proposed scheme are demonstrated, the clusters are
optimized. With the help of the simulations, the relative energy consumption
and the end-to-end blocking probability are all improved. The addressing ratio
of success in the condition of the unchanged parameters and external
information can be increased and the network can tolerate more hops to support
reliable transportation by the proposed scheme.
