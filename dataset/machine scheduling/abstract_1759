Recent advances in high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology have
revolutionized transcriptome studies. A major motivation for RNA-Seq is to map
the structure of expressed transcripts at nucleotide resolution. With accurate
computational tools for transcript reconstruction, this technology may also
become useful for genome (re-)annotation, which has mostly relied on de novo
gene finding where gene structures are primarily inferred from the genome
sequence. We developed a machine-learning method, called mTim (margin-based
transcript inference method) for transcript reconstruction from RNA-Seq read
alignments that is based on discriminatively trained hidden Markov support
vector machines. In addition to features derived from read alignments, it
utilizes characteristic genomic sequences, e.g. around splice sites, to improve
transcript predictions. mTim inferred transcripts that were highly accurate and
relatively robust to alignment errors in comparison to those from Cufflinks, a
widely used transcript assembly method.
