In the last decade, scheduling of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) application in
the context of Grid environment has attracted attention of many researchers.
However, deployment of Grid environment requires skills, efforts, budget, and
time. Although various simulation toolkits or frameworks are available for
simulating Grid environment, either they support different possible studies in
Grid computing area or takes lot of efforts in molding them to make them
suitable for scheduling of DAG application. In this paper, we describe design
and implementation of GridSim based ready to use application scheduler for
scheduling of DAG application in Grid environment. The proposed application
scheduler supports supplying DAG application and configuration of Grid
resources through GUI. We also describe implementation of Min-Min static
scheduling algorithm for scheduling of DAG application to validate the proposed
scheduler. Our proposed DAG application scheduling simulator is useful, easy,
and time-saver.
