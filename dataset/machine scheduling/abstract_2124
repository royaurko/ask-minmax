The main goal of this research is to develop the concepts of a revolutionary
processor system called Functional Processor System. The fairly novel work
carried out in this proposal concentrates on decoding of function pipelines and
distributing it in FPUs as a part of scheduling approach. As the functional
programs are super-level programs that entails requirements only at functional
level, decoding of functions and distribution of functions in the heterogeneous
functional processor units are a challenge. We explored the possibilities of
segregation of the functions from the application program and distributing the
functions on the relevant FPUs by using address mapping techniques. Here we
pursue the perception of feeding the functions into the processor farm rather
than the processor fetching the instructions or functions and executing it.
This work is carried out at theoretical levels and it requires a long way to go
in the realization of this work in hardware perhaps with a large industrial
team with a pragmatic time frame.
