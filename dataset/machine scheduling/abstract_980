We consider the question whether there is an infinitary analogue of the
Church-Turing-thesis. To this end, we argue that there is an intuitive notion
of transfinite computability and build a canonical model, called Idealized
Agent Machines ($IAM$s) of this which will turn out to be equivalent in
strength to the Ordinal Turing Machines defined by P. Koepke.
