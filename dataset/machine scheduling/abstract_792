In this paper we address two basic questions in wireless communication:
First, how long does it take to schedule an arbitrary set of communication
requests? Second, given a set of communication requests, how many of them can
be scheduled concurrently? Our results are derived in an interference model
with geometric path loss and consist of efficient algorithms that find a
constant approximation for the second problem and a logarithmic approximation
for the first problem. In addition, we analyze some important properties of the
interference model and show that it is robust to various factors that can
influence the signal attenuation. More specifically, we prove that as long as
such influences on the signal attenuation are constant, they affect the
capacity only by a constant factor.
