We present the cosmological and astrophysical objectives of the SPOrt
mission, which is scheduled for flying on the International Space Station (ISS)
in the year 2002 with the purpose of measuring the diffuse sky polarized
radiation in the microwave region. We discuss the problem of disentangling the
cosmic background polarized signal from the Galactic foregrounds.
