This paper investigates the relationship between the Logical Algorithms
language (LA) of Ganzinger and McAllester and Constraint Handling Rules (CHR).
We present a translation schema from LA to CHR-rp: CHR with rule priorities,
and show that the meta-complexity theorem for LA can be applied to a subset of
CHR-rp via inverse translation. Inspired by the high-level implementation
proposal for Logical Algorithm by Ganzinger and McAllester and based on a new
scheduling algorithm, we propose an alternative implementation for CHR-rp that
gives strong complexity guarantees and results in a new and accurate
meta-complexity theorem for CHR-rp. It is furthermore shown that the
translation from Logical Algorithms to CHR-rp combined with the new CHR-rp
implementation, satisfies the required complexity for the Logical Algorithms
meta-complexity result to hold.
