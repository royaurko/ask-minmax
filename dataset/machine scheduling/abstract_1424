We provide a simple method and relevant theoretical analysis for efficiently
estimating higher-order lp distances. While the analysis mainly focuses on l4,
our methodology extends naturally to p = 6,8,10..., (i.e., when p is even).
Distance-based methods are popular in machine learning. In large-scale
applications, storing, computing, and retrieving the distances can be both
space and time prohibitive. Efficient algorithms exist for estimating lp
distances if 0 < p <= 2. The task for p > 2 is known to be difficult. Our work
partially fills this gap.
