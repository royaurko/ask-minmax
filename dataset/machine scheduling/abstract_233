Overheating has been acknowledged as a major issue in testing complex SOCs.
Several power constrained system-level DFT solutions (power constrained test
scheduling) have recently been proposed to tackle this problem. However, as it
will be shown in this paper, imposing a chip-level maximum power constraint
doesn't necessarily avoid local overheating due to the non-uniform distribution
of power across the chip. This paper proposes a new approach for dealing with
overheating during test, by embedding thermal awareness into test scheduling.
The proposed approach facilitates rapid generation of thermal-safer test
schedules without requiring time-consuming thermal simulations. This is
achieved by employing a low-complexity test session thermal model used to guide
the test schedule generation algorithm. This approach reduces the chances of a
design re-spin due to potential overheating during test.
