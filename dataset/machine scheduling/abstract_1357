The continuation of Misner space into the Euclidean region is seen to imply
the topological restriction that the period of the closed spatial direction
becomes time-dependent. This restriction results in a modified Lorentzian
Misner space in which the renormalized stress-energy tensor for quantized
complex massless scalar fields becomes regular everywhere, even on the
chronology horizon. A quantum-mechanically stable time machine with just the
sub-microscopic size may then be constructed out of the modified Misner space,
for which the semiclassical Hawking's chronology protection conjecture is no
longer an obstruction.
