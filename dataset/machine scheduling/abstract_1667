Since its emergence in the 1990s the World Wide Web (WWW) has rapidly evolved
into a huge mine of global information and it is growing in size everyday. The
presence of huge amount of resources on the Web thus poses a serious problem of
accurate search. This is mainly because today's Web is a human-readable Web
where information cannot be easily processed by machine. Highly sophisticated,
efficient keyword based search engines that have evolved today have not been
able to bridge this gap. So comes up the concept of the Semantic Web which is
envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee as the Web of machine interpretable information
to make a machine processable form for expressing information. Based on the
semantic Web technologies we present in this paper the design methodology and
development of a semantic Web search engine which provides exact search results
for a domain specific search. This search engine is developed for an
agricultural Website which hosts agricultural information about the state of
West Bengal.
