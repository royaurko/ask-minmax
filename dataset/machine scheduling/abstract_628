Vibrations appearance, either unstability system, is the result of the
dynamic interaction of the cutting process with the elastic system of machine
tools in various working conditions. Our objective is to develop an
experimental three-dimensional dynamic model in milling. Our purpose is to
applied this model to optimize the cutting parameters and to monitor cutting
process, milling tool and machine-tool. To reach the detailed knowledge of the
dynamic phenomena we divide our study into two parts : the machine and the
cutting process. The dynamic analysis of the machine is compulsory before
modelling the vibratory phenomena during the cutting. A dynamic analysis method
is developed to characterize completely the various machine tools components.
