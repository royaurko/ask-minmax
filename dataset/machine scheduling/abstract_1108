Virtualization started to gain traction in the domain of information
technology in the early 2000s when managing resource distribution was becoming
an uphill task for developers. As a result, tools like VMWare, Hyper V
(hypervisor) started making inroads into the software repository on different
operating systems. VMWare and Hyper V could support multiple virtual machines
running on them with each having their own isolated environment. Due to this
isolation, the security aspects of virtual machines (VMs) did not differ much
from that of physical machines (having a dedicated operating system on
hardware). The advancement made in the domain of linux containers (LXC) has
taken virtualization to an altogether different level where resource
utilization by various applications has been further optimized. But the
container security has assumed primary importance amongst the researchers today
and this paper is inclined towards providing a brief overview about comparisons
between security of container and VMs.
