Pulsation is believed to be the leading cause of dusty mass loss from
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. We present a temporal study of T Cep, a
long-period Mira variable, using seven ISO SWS spectra, covering a 16-month
period over a single pulsation cycle. The observed spectral dust features
change over the pulsation cycle of this Mira. In general, the overall apparent
changes in spectral features can be attributed to changes in the dust
temperature, resulting from the intrinsic pulsation cycle of the central star.
However, not all feature changes are so easily explained. Based on direct
comparison with laboratory spectra of several potential minerals, the dust is
best explained by crystalline iron-rich silicates. These findings contradict
the currently favored dust formation hypotheses.
