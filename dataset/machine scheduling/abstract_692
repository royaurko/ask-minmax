In this paper, a practical micromachining technology was applied for the
fabrication of a micro probe using a complex nontraditional machining process.
A series process was combined to machine tungsten carbide rods from original
dimension. The original dimension of tungsten carbide rods was 3mm ; the rods
were ground to a fixed-dimension of 50 micrometers using precision grinding
machine in first step. And then, the rod could be machined to a
middle-dimension of 20 micrometers by electrolysis. A final desired micro
dimension can be achieved using supersonic aided electrolysis.
High-aspect-ratio of micro tungsten carbide rod was easily obtained by this
process. Surface roughness of the sample with supersonic aided agitation was
compared with that with no agitation in electrolysis. The machined surface of
the sample is very smooth due to ionized particles of anode could be removed by
supersonic aided agitation during electrolysis. Deep micro holes can also be
achieved by the machined high-aspect-rati tungsten carbide rod using EDM
process. A micro probe of a ball shape at the end was processed by proposed
supersonic aided electrolysis machining process.
