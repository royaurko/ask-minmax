On a commercial digital still camera (DSC) controller chip we practice a
novel SOC test integration platform, solving real problems in test scheduling,
test IO reduction, timing of functional test, scan IO sharing, embedded memory
built-in self-test (BIST), etc. The chip has been fabricated and tested
successfully by our approach. Test results justify that short test integration
cost, short test time, and small area overhead can be achieved. To support SOC
testing, a memory BIST compiler and an SOC testing integration system have been
developed.
