The inherent heterogeneous structure resulting from user densities and large
scale channel effects motivates heterogeneous partial feedback design in
heterogeneous networks. In such emerging networks, a distributed scheduling
policy which enjoys multiuser diversity as well as maintains fairness among
users is favored for individual user rate enhancement and guarantees. For a
system employing the cumulative distribution function based scheduling, which
satisfies the two above mentioned desired features, we develop an analytical
framework to investigate heterogeneous partial feedback in a general
OFDMA-based heterogeneous multicell employing the best-M partial feedback
strategy. Exact sum rate analysis is first carried out and closed form
expressions are obtained by a novel decomposition of the probability density
function of the selected user's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. To
draw further insight, we perform asymptotic analysis using extreme value theory
to examine the effect of partial feedback on the randomness of multiuser
diversity, show the asymptotic optimality of best-1 feedback, and derive an
asymptotic approximation for the sum rate in order to determine the minimum
required partial feedback.
