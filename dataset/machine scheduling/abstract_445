Basic Parallel Processes (BPPs) are a well-known subclass of Petri Nets. They
are the simplest common model of concurrent programs that allows unbounded
spawning of processes. In the probabilistic version of BPPs, every process
generates other processes according to a probability distribution. We study the
decidability and complexity of fundamental qualitative problems over
probabilistic BPPs -- in particular reachability with probability 1 of
different classes of target sets (e.g. upward-closed sets). Our results concern
both the Markov-chain model, where processes are scheduled randomly, and the
MDP model, where processes are picked by a scheduler.
