We present time-constrained automata (TCA), a model for hard real-time
computation in which agents behaviors are modeled by automata and constrained
by time intervals.
  TCA actions can have multiple start time and deadlines, can be aperiodic, and
are selected dynamically following a graph, the time-constrained automaton.
This allows expressing much more precise time constraints than classical
periodic or sporadic model, while preserving the ease of scheduling and
analysis.
  We provide some properties of this model as well as their scheduling
semantics. We show that TCA can be automatically derived from source-code, and
optimally scheduled on single processors using a variant of EDF. We explain how
time constraints can be used to guarantee communication determinism by
construction, and to study when possible agent interactions happen.
