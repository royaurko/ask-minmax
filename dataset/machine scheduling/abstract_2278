This paper studies the real-time implementation of distributed controllers on
networked cyber-physical systems. We build on the strengths of event- and
self-triggered control to synthesize a unified approach, termed team-triggered,
where agents make promises to one another about their future states and are
responsible for warning each other if they later decide to break them. The
information provided by these promises allows individual agents to autonomously
schedule information requests in the future and sets the basis for maintaining
desired levels of performance at lower implementation cost. We establish
provably correct guarantees for the distributed strategies that result from the
proposed approach and examine their robustness against delays, packet drops,
and communication noise. The results are illustrated in simulations of a
multi-agent formation control problem.
