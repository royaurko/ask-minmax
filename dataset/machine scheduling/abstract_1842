Oscillations between swing modes of electric machines is an important
limitation in achieving a high level of transient performance and reliability
in power grids. Based on the new advances in measurement and transmission of
wide-area information, this work proposes a distributed networked control
scheme by considering the communication delays. The results are applied to
reduce the inter-area swing oscillations in a power grid. In comparison with
the previous works, we provide a more realistic modeling of the resulting
networked control system with data sampling and delays. The exactness of the
proposed modeling allows for precise evaluation and comparison between the
distributed and decentralized schema. A symmetric a dual machine power system
is highly oscillatory and we focus on this case to evaluate the ability of the
proposed control design in dampening of the oscillations. The design can be
done either based on optimization of a quadratic cost function or a disturbance
attenuation level
