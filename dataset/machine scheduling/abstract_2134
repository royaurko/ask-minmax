We study the detectability and characterization of electron beams as they
leave their acceleration site in the low corona toward interplanetary space
through their nonthermal X-ray bremsstrahlung emission. We demonstrate that the
largest interplanetary electron beams (>=10^35 electrons above 10 keV) can be
detected in X-rays with current and future instrumentation, such as RHESSI or
the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) onboard Hinode.We make a list of optimal observing
conditions and beam characteristics. Amongst others, good imaging (as opposed
to mere localization or detection in spatially integrated data) is required for
proper characterization, putting the requirement on the number of escaping
electrons (above 10 keV) to >= 3 \times 10^36 for RHESSI, >=3 \times 10^35 for
Hinode/XRT, and >=10^33 electrons for the FOXSI sounding rocket scheduled to
fly in 2011. Moreover, we have found that simple modeling hints at the
possibility that coronal soft X-ray jets could be the result of local heating
by propagating electron beams.
