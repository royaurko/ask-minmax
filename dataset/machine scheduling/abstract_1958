The PLANCK satellite, scheduled for launch in 2007, will produce a set of all
sky maps in nine frequency bands spanning from 30 GHz to 857 GHz, with an
unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. Planets, minor bodies and diffuse
interplanetary dust will contribute to the (sub)mm sky emission observed by
PLANCK, representing a source of foreground contamination to be removed before
extracting the cosmological information. The aim of this paper is to assess the
expected level of contamination in the survey of the forthcoming PLANCK
mission. Starting from existing far-infrared (far-IR) models of the Zodiacal
Light Emission (ZLE), we present a new method to simulate the time-dependent
level of contamination from ZLE at PLANCK frequencies. We studied the
possibility of PLANCK to detect and separate the ZLE contribution from the
other astrophysical signals. We discuss the conditions in which PLANCK will be
able to increase the existing information on the ZLE and IDP physical
properties.
