This paper is proposing a general periodicity result concerning any
deterministic and memoryless scheduling algorithm (including
non-work-conserving algorithms), for any context, on identical multiprocessor
platforms. By context we mean the hardware architecture (uniprocessor,
multicore), as well as task constraints like critical sections, precedence
constraints, self-suspension, etc. Since the result is based only on the
releases and deadlines, it is independent from any other parameter. Note that
we do not claim that the given interval is minimal, but it is an upper bound
for any cycle of any feasible schedule provided by any deterministic and
memoryless scheduler.
