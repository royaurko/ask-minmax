Electrical resistivity ($\rho$), magnetoresistance (MR), magnetization,
thermopower and Hall effect measurements on the single crystal
Gd$_{2}$PdSi$_3$, crystallizing in an AlB$_2$-derived hexagonal structure are
reported. The well-defined minimum in $\rho$ at a temperature above N\'eel
temperature (T$_N$= 21 K) and large negative MR below $\sim$ 3T$_N$, reported
earlier for the polycrystals, are reproducible even in single crystals. Such
features are generally uncharacteristic of Gd alloys. In addition, we also
found interesting features in other data, e.g., two-step first-order-like
metamagnetic transitions for the magnetic field along [0001] direction. The
alloy exhibits anisotropy in all these properties, though Gd is a S-state ion.
