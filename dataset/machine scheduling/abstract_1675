CHRONIOUS is an Open, Ubiquitous and Adaptive Chronic Disease Management
Platform for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(COPD) Chronic Kidney Disease
(CKD) and Renal Insufficiency. It consists of several modules: an ontology
based literature search engine, a rule based decision support system, remote
sensors interacting with lifestyle interfaces (PDA, monitor touchscreen) and a
machine learning module. All these modules interact each other to allow the
monitoring of two types of chronic diseases and to help clinician in taking
decision for cure purpose. This paper illustrates how some machine learning
algorithms and a rule based decision support system can be used in smart
devices, to monitor chronic patient. We will analyse how a set of machine
learning algorithms can be used in smart devices to alert the clinician in case
of a patient health condition worsening trend.
