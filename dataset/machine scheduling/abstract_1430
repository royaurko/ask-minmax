We apply the spike-and-slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ssRBM) to texture
modeling. The ssRBM with tiled-convolution weight sharing (TssRBM) achieves or
surpasses the state-of-the-art on texture synthesis and inpainting by
parametric models. We also develop a novel RBM model with a spike-and-slab
visible layer and binary variables in the hidden layer. This model is designed
to be stacked on top of the TssRBM. We show the resulting deep belief network
(DBN) is a powerful generative model that improves on single-layer models and
is capable of modeling not only single high-resolution and challenging textures
but also multiple textures.
