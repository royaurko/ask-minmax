In this paper, a nurse-scheduling model is developed using mixed integer
programming model. It is deployed to a general care ward to replace and
automate the current manual approach for scheduling. The developed model
differs from other similar studies in that it optimizes both hospitals
requirement as well as nurse preferences by allowing flexibility in the
transfer of nurses from different duties. The model also incorporated
additional policies which are part of the hospitals requirement but not part of
the legislations. Hospitals key primary mission is to ensure continuous ward
care service with appropriate number of nursing staffs and the right mix of
nursing skills. The planning and scheduling is done to avoid additional non
essential cost for hospital. Nurses preferences are taken into considerations
such as the number of night shift and consecutive rest days. We will also
reformulate problems from another paper which considers the penalty objective
using the model but without the flexible components. The models are built using
AIMMS which solves the problem in very short amount of time.
