The MONS space experiment will be able to verify some of the most important
topics in the asteroseismologic studies of Delta Sct and Gamma Dor stars. We
discuss how the $\gamma$ Doradus can be considered possible "bridges" between
the opacity driven overstable pulsation and the stochastically excited solar
like oscillation. For this reason the possible inclusion of a Gamma Dor
representative in the MONS main target list is presented and discussed. To
study Delta Sct stars, an appropriate frequency resolution, comparable to or
better than what is currently achieved by ground-based observations, is
necessary and hence two runs are recommended. To avoid over-scheduling of the
Main Camera, a possible combination of observations from the Main Camera and
from the Star Trackers is proposed. As a result, key-objects could be
adequately monitored, affording the possibility to enter into details of
amplitude variations. Simultaneously, the same results could be obtained on two
Gamma Dor stars.
