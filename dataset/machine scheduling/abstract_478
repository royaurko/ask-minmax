We consider scheduled message communication over a discrete memoryless
degraded broadcast channel. The framework we consider here models both the
random message arrivals and the subsequent reliable communication by suitably
combining techniques from queueing theory and information theory. The channel
from the transmitter to each of the receivers is quasi-static, flat, and with
independent fades across the receivers. Requests for message transmissions are
assumed to arrive according to an i.i.d. arrival process. Then, (i) we derive
an outer bound to the region of message arrival vectors achievable by the class
of stationary scheduling policies, (ii) we show for any message arrival vector
that satisfies the outerbound, that there exists a stationary
``state-independent'' policy that results in a stable system for the
corresponding message arrival process, and (iii) under two asymptotic regimes,
we show that the stability region of nat arrival rate vectors has
information-theoretic capacity region interpretation.
