We propose reactive Turing machines (RTMs), extending classical Turing
machines with a process-theoretical notion of interaction, and use it to define
a notion of executable transition system. We show that every computable
transition system with a bounded branching degree is simulated modulo
divergence-preserving branching bisimilarity by an RTM, and that every
effective transition system is simulated modulo the variant of branching
bisimilarity that does not require divergence preservation. We conclude from
these results that the parallel composition of (communicating) RTMs can be
simulated by a single RTM. We prove that there exist universal RTMs modulo
branching bisimilarity, but these essentially employ divergence to be able to
simulate an RTM of arbitrary branching degree. We also prove that modulo
divergence-preserving branching bisimilarity there are RTMs that are universal
up to their own branching degree. Finally, we establish a correspondence
between executability and finite definability in a simple process calculus.
