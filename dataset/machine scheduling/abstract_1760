We show that alternating Turing machines, with a novel and natural definition
of acceptance, accept precisely the inductive (Pi-1-1) languages. Total
alternating machines, that either accept or reject each input, accept precisely
the hyper-elementary (Delta-1-1) languages. Moreover, bounding the permissible
number of alternations yields a characterization of the levels of the
arithmetical hierarchy. Notably, these results use simple finite computing
devices, with finitary and discrete operational semantics, and neither the
results nor their proofs make any use of transfinite ordinals. Our
characterizations elucidate the analogy between the polynomial-time hierarchy
and the arithmetical hierarchy, as well as between their respective limits,
namely polynomial-space and Pi-1-1.
