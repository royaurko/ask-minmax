We report the first detection of a planetary-mass companion to a star using
the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). The
HET-HRS now gives routine radial velocity precision of 2-3 m/s for high SNR
observations of quiescent stars. The planetary-mass companion to the metal-rich
K0V star HD37605 has an orbital period of 54.23 days, an orbital eccentricity
of 0.737, and a minimum mass of 2.84 Jupiter masses. The queue-scheduled
operation of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope enabled us to discovery of this
relatively short-period planet with a total observation time span of just two
orbital periods. The ability of queue-scheduled large-aperture telescopes to
respond quickly to interesting and important results demonstrates the power of
this new approach in searching for extra-solar planets as well as in other ares
of research requiring rapid response time critical observations.
