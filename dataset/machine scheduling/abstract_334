The IT organizations invests heavy capital by consuming large scale
infrastructure and advanced operating platforms. The advances in technology has
resulted in emergence of cloud computing, which is promising technology to
achieve the aforementioned objective. At the peak hours, the jobs arriving to
the cloud system are normally high demanding efficient execution and dispatch.
An observation that has been carried out in this paper by capturing a job
arriving pattern from a monitoring system explains that most of the jobs get
rejected because of lack of efficient technology. The job rejections can be
controlled by certain factors such as job scheduling and load balancing.
Therefore, in this paper the efficiency of Round Robin (RR) scheduling strategy
used for job scheduling and Shortest Job First Scheduling (SJFS) technique used
for load balancing in reducing the job rejections are analyzed. Further, a
proposal for an effective load balancing approach to avoid deadlocks has been
discussed.
