The low temperature specific heat of annealed single crystal samples of
Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 with compositions spanning the entire superconducting phase
diagram was measured. Effort was made to discover the best annealing schedule
to maximize Tc and minimize transition width in these samples. Values of
deltaC/Tc normalized to 100% superconducting volume fractions varied
proportionally to Tc^alpha. Within a rather narrow error bar of +-0.15, the
exponent alpha was the same (approximately 2) over a range of compositions
(0.055 < x < 0.15) around the optimal concentration, x=0.08, where Tc is the
maximum in the phase diagram. Thus, whether the superconductivity was
coexistent with magnetism (underdoped) or not (overdoped) did not affect the
non-BCS variation (alpha nearly 2 instead of 0.8-0.9 for BCS superconductors)
of deltaC/Tc with Tc. The annealed samples in the present work, with increased
deltaC/Tc and Tc values compared to previous results for the Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2
alloy system, suggest that the intrinsic value of the exponent alpha for the
iron superconductors, when the samples are annealed, with fewer defects, may
indeed be even further from the BCS value of 0.8-0.9 than previously thought.
