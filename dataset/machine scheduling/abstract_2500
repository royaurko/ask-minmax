Based on the concept of annotation-based agents, this report introduces tools
and a formal notation for defining and running text mining experiments using a
statically typed domain-specific language embedded in Scala. Using machine
learning for classification as an example, the framework is used to develop and
document text mining experiments, and to show how the concept of generic,
typesafe annotation corresponds to a general information model that goes beyond
text processing.
