In wireless fading channels, multi-user scheduling has the potential to boost
the spectral efficiency by exploiting diversity gains. In this regard,
proportional fair (PF) scheduling provides a solution for increasing the users'
quality of experience by finding a balance between system throughput
maximization and user fairness. For this purpose, precise instantaneous channel
state information (CSI) needs to be available at the transmitter side to
perform rate adaptation and scheduling. However, in practical setups, CSI is
impaired by, e.g., channel estimation errors, quantization and feedback delays.
Especially in centralized cloud based communication systems, where main parts
of the lower layer processing is shifted to a central entity, high backhaul
latency can cause substantial CSI imperfections, resulting in significant
performance degradations. In this work robust rate adaptation as well as robust
PF scheduling are presented, which account for CSI impairments. The proposed
rate adaptation solution guarantees a fixed target outage probability, which is
of interest for delay critical and data intensive applications, such as, video
conference systems. In addition to CSI imperfections the proposed scheduler is
able to account for delayed decoding acknowledgements from the receiver.
