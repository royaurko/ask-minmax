The malicious alteration of machine time is a big challenge in computer
forensics. Detecting such changes and reconstructing the actual timeline of
events is of paramount importance. However, this can be difficult since the
attacker has many opportunities and means to hide such changes. In particular,
cloud computing, host and guest machine time can be manipulated in various ways
by an attacker. Guest virtual machines are especially vulnerable to attacks
coming from their (more privileged) host. As such, it is important to guarantee
the timeline integrity of both hosts and guests in a cloud, or at least to
ensure that the alteration of such timeline does not go undetected. In this
paper we survey the issues related to host and guest machine time integrity in
the cloud. Further, we describe a novel architecture for host and guest time
alteration detection and correction/resilience with respect to compromised
hosts and guests. The proposed framework has been implemented on an especially
built simulator. Collected results are evaluated and discussed. Performance
figures show the feasibility of our proposal.
