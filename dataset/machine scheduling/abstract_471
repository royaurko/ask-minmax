To satisfy the increasing demand for multimedia services in broadband
Internet networks, the WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Acces)
technology has emerged as an alternative to the wired broadband access
solutions. It provides an Internet connection to broadband coverage area of
several kilometers in radius by ensuring a satisfactory quality of service
(QoS), it's an adequate response to some rural or inaccessible areas. Unlike
DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) or other wired technology, WiMAX uses radio waves
and can provide point-to-multipoint (PMP) and point-to-point (P2P) modes. In
parallel, it's observed that in the opposite of the traditional quality
evaluation approaches, nowadays, current researches focus on the user perceived
quality, the existing scheduling algorithms take into account the QoS and many
other parameters, but not the Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we
present a QoE-based scheduling solution in WiMAX network in order to make the
scheduling of the UGS connections based on the use of QoE metrics. Indeed, the
proposed solution allows controlling the packet transmission rate so as to
match with the minimum subjective rate requirements of each user. Simulation
results show that by applying various levels of mean opinion score (MOS) the
QoE provided to the users is improved in term of throughput, jitter, packet
loss rate and delay.
