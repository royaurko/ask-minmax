Average cosmological invariant parameters (ACIPs) are calculated for six
groups of BATSE cosmic gamma-ray bursts selected by their peak fluxes on the
1.024 s time scale. The ACIPs represent the average temporal and spectral
properties of these events equally in the observer frame of reference and in
the co-moving frames of outbursting emitters. The parameters are determined
separately for rise fronts and for back slopes of bursts, defined as the time
profiles before and after the main peaks, respectively. The ACIPs for the rise
fronts are found to be different for different intensity groups, while the
ACIPs for the back slopes show no significant dependence on intensity. We
conclude that emitters of bursts manifest standard average properties only
during the back slopes of bursts.
