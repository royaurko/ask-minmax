We report the discovery of the shocked molecular gas in the supernova remnant
HB 21. We derive the physical parameters of the shocked gas from CO J=1-0 and
J=2-1 line observations. We discuss the correlation of the shocked molecular
gas with the previously detected, shocked atomic gas and the associated
infrared emission.
