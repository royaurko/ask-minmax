We study the \emph{bounded-delay model} for Qualify-of-Service buffer
management. Time is discrete. There is a buffer. Unit-length jobs (also called
\emph{packets}) arrive at the buffer over time. Each packet has an integer
release time, an integer deadline, and a positive real value. A packet's
characteristics are not known to an online algorithm until the packet actually
arrives. In each time step, at most one packet can be sent out of the buffer.
The objective is to maximize the total value of the packets sent by their
respective deadlines in an online manner. An online algorithm's performance is
usually measured in terms of \emph{competitive ratio}, when this online
algorithm is compared with a clairvoyant algorithm achieving the best total
value. In this paper, we study a simple and intuitive online algorithm. We
analyze its performance in terms of competitive ratio for the general model and
a few important variants.
