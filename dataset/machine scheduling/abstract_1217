We propose a tool-supported methodology for design-space exploration for
embedded systems. It provides means to define high-level models of applications
and multi-processor architectures and evaluate the performance of different
deployment (mapping, scheduling) strategies while taking uncertainty into
account. We argue that this extension of the scope of formal verification is
important for the viability of the domain.
