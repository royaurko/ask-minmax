Machine Translation is the translation of one natural language into another
using automated and computerized means. For a multilingual country like India,
with the huge amount of information exchanged between various regions and in
different languages in digitized format, it has become necessary to find an
automated process from one language to another. In this paper, we take a look
at the various Machine Translation System in India which is specifically built
for the purpose of translation between the Indian languages. We discuss the
various approaches taken for building the machine translation system and then
discuss some of the Machine Translation Systems in India along with their
features.
