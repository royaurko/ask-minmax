We present OpenML and mldata, open science platforms that provides easy
access to machine learning data, software and results to encourage further
study and application. They go beyond the more traditional repositories for
data sets and software packages in that they allow researchers to also easily
share the results they obtained in experiments and to compare their solutions
with those of others.
