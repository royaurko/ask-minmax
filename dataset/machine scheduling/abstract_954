The present paper presents and proves a proposition concerning the time
complexity of finite languages. It is shown herein, that for any finite
language (a language for which the set of words composing it is finite) there
is a Turing machine that computes the language in such a way that for any input
of length k the machine stops in, at most, k + 1 steps.
