Disease management programs have emerged as a cost-effective approach to
treat chronic diseases. Appointment adherence is critical to the success of
such programs; missed appointment are costly, resulting in reduced resource
utilization and worsening of patients' health states. The time of an
appointment is one of the factors that impacts adherence. We investigate the
benefits, in terms of improved adherence, of incorporating patients'
time-of-day preferences during appointment schedule creation and, thus,
ultimately, on population health outcomes. Through an extensive computational
study, we demonstrate, more generally, the usefulness of patient stratification
in appointment scheduling in the environment that motivates our research, an
asthma management program offered in Chicago. We find that capturing patient
characteristics in appointment scheduling, especially their time preferences,
leads to substantial improvements in community health outcomes. We also
identify settings in which simple, easy-to-use policies can produce schedules
that are comparable in quality to those obtained with an optimization-based
approach.
