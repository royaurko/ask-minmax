In multiview applications, multiple cameras acquire the same scene from
different viewpoints and generally produce correlated video streams. This
results in large amounts of highly redundant data. In order to save resources,
it is critical to handle properly this correlation during encoding and
transmission of the multiview data. In this work, we propose a
correlation-aware packet scheduling algorithm for multi-camera networks, where
information from all cameras are transmitted over a bottleneck channel to
clients that reconstruct the multiview images. The scheduling algorithm relies
on a new rate-distortion model that captures the importance of each view in the
scene reconstruction. We propose a problem formulation for the optimization of
the packet scheduling policies, which adapt to variations in the scene content.
Then, we design a low complexity scheduling algorithm based on a trellis search
that selects the subset of candidate packets to be transmitted towards
effective multiview reconstruction at clients. Extensive simulation results
confirm the gain of our scheduling algorithm when inter-source correlation
information is used in the scheduler, compared to scheduling policies with no
information about the correlation or non-adaptive scheduling policies. We
finally show that increasing the optimization horizon in the packet scheduling
algorithm improves the transmission performance, especially in scenarios where
the level of correlation rapidly varies with time.
