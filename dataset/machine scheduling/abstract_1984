The Ginzburg-Landau equations are derived from the microscopic theory for
clean layered superconductors with $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing symmetry, including
the Pauli paramagnetism effect. The upper critical field $H_{c2}$ parallel to
the $c$ axis is calculated. A comparison with the experimental data for YBCO
suggests that, relative to the orbital effect, the Pauli paramagnetism
contribution to $H_{c2}$ is significant. The reversible magnetization $M$ in
high magnetic fields is also calculated, showing strong temperature dependence
of the slope $dM/dH$, as a consequence of the spin paramagnetism. A simple
expression for the high temperature spin susceptibility is derived, in a good
agreement with the Knight shift measurements on YBCO.
