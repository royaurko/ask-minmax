A real-coded genetic algorithm is used to schedule the charging of an energy
storage system (ESS), operated in tandem with renewable power by an electricity
consumer who is subject to time-of-use pricing and a demand charge. Simulations
based on load and generation profiles of typical residential customers show
that an ESS scheduled by our algorithm can reduce electricity costs by
approximately 17%, compared to a system without an ESS, and by 8% compared to a
scheduling algorithm based on net power.
