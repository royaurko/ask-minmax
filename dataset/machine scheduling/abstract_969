In this paper, we investigate the following question: how could you write
such computer programs that can work like conscious beings? The motivation
behind this question is that we want to create such applications that can see
the future. The aim of this paper is to provide an overall conceptual framework
for this new approach to machine consciousness. So we introduce a new
programming paradigm called Consciousness Oriented Programming (COP).
