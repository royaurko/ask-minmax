The article describe the model, derivation, and implementation of variational
Bayesian inference for linear and logistic regression, both with and without
automatic relevance determination. It has the dual function of acting as a
tutorial for the derivation of variational Bayesian inference for simple
models, as well as documenting, and providing brief examples for the MATLAB
functions that implement this inference. These functions are freely available
online.
