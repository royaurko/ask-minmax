In this paper, we consider the problem of sum throughput maximization for
bidirectional relay networks with block fading. Thereby, user 1 and user 2
exchange information only via a relay node, i.e., a direct link between both
users is not present. We assume that channel state information at the
transmitter (CSIT) is not available and/or only one coding and modulation
scheme is used at the transmitters due to complexity constraints. Thus, the
nodes transmit with a fixed predefined rate regardless of the channel state
information (CSI). In general, the nodes in the network can assume one of three
possible states in each time slot, namely the transmit, receive, and silent
state. Most of the existing protocols assume a fixed schedule for the sequence
of the states of the nodes. In this paper, we abandon the restriction of having
a fixed and predefined schedule and propose a new protocol which, based on the
CSI at the receiver (CSIR), selects the optimal states of the nodes in each
time slot such that the sum throughput is maximized. To this end, the relay has
to be equipped with two buffers for storage of the information received from
the two users. Numerical results show that the proposed protocol significantly
outperforms the existing protocols.
