In this article we present the design choices and the evaluation of a batch
scheduler for large clusters, named OAR. This batch scheduler is based upon an
original design that emphasizes on low software complexity by using high level
tools. The global architecture is built upon the scripting language Perl and
the relational database engine Mysql. The goal of the project OAR is to prove
that it is possible today to build a complex system for ressource management
using such tools without sacrificing efficiency and scalability. Currently, our
system offers most of the important features implemented by other batch
schedulers such as priority scheduling (by queues), reservations, backfilling
and some global computing support. Despite the use of high level tools, our
experiments show that our system has performances close to other systems.
Furthermore, OAR is currently exploited for the management of 700 nodes (a
metropolitan GRID) and has shown good efficiency and robustness.
