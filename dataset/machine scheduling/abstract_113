In this work we apply model averaging to parallel training of deep neural
network (DNN). Parallelization is done in a model averaging manner. Data is
partitioned and distributed to different nodes for local model updates, and
model averaging across nodes is done every few minibatches. We use multiple
GPUs for data parallelization, and Message Passing Interface (MPI) for
communication between nodes, which allows us to perform model averaging
frequently without losing much time on communication. We investigate the
effectiveness of Natural Gradient Stochastic Gradient Descent (NG-SGD) and
Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) pretraining for parallel training in
model-averaging framework, and explore the best setups in term of different
learning rate schedules, averaging frequencies and minibatch sizes. It is shown
that NG-SGD and RBM pretraining benefits parameter-averaging based model
training. On the 300h Switchboard dataset, a 9.3 times speedup is achieved
using 16 GPUs and 17 times speedup using 32 GPUs with limited decoding accuracy
loss.
