NGC1313 X-2 was among the first ultraluminous X-ray sources discovered, and
has been a frequent target of X-ray and optical observations. Using the HST/ACS
multi-band observations, this source is identified with a unique counterpart
within an error circle of $0\farcs2$. The counterpart is a blue star on the
edge of a young cluster of $\le10^7$ years amid a dominant old stellar
population. Its spectral energy distribution is consistent with that for a
Z=0.004 star with 8.5 $M_\odot$ about $5\times10^6$ years old, or for an O7 V
star at solar metallicity. The counterpart exhibited significant variability of
$\Delta m = 0.153\pm0.033$ mag between two F555W observations separated by
three months, reminiscent of the ellipsoidal variability due to the orbital
motion of this ULX binary.
