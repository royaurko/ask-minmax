We describe a new ring laser with area A = 833 m^2 and update performance
statistics for several such machines. Anandan & Chaio 1982 judged ring lasers
inferior to matter interferometers as possible detectors of gravitational
waves. However, we note that geophysically interesting results have been
obtained from large ring lasers and that there is still a lot of room for
improvements.
