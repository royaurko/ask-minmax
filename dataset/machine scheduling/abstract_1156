We establish a variety of extensions to the Erdos-Rado Theorem, particularly
involving ordinal numbers, and always involving ordinary partition relations.
Most of the results can be regarded as consequences of the Ramification
Principle, interpreted appropriately. Some of these problems have been open for
a long time. There is a detailed summary at the beginning of the paper. The
paper is scheduled to appear as part of the proceedings of the Banff meeting
held in 1991.
