We present the prospects for a future joint gamma-ray and radio survey of
southern hemisphere sources using the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the
upcoming Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope.
ASKAP is a next generation radio telescope designed to perform surveys at GHz
frequencies at a much higher survey speed than previous radio telescopes, and
is scheduled to start engineering observations in 2011. The survey capabilities
of both Fermi LAT and ASKAP are described, and the planned science surveys for
ASKAP are summarized. We give some expected details of the Variable and Slow
Transient (VAST) survey using ASKAP, which will search for transients on
timescales from 5 seconds to years. Some observational properties of faint and
transient sources seen at gamma-ray and radio wavelengths are summarized, and
prospects and strategies for using ASKAP survey data for LAT source counterpart
identification are summarized.
