Artificial intelligence offers superior techniques and methods by which
problems from diverse domains may find an optimal solution. The Machine
Learning technologies refer to the domain of artificial intelligence aiming to
develop the techniques allowing the computers to "learn". Some systems based on
Machine Learning technologies tend to eliminate the necessity of the human
intelligence while the others adopt a man-machine collaborative approach.
