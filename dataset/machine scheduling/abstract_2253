Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a new frequency domain non-orthogonal
multiple-access technique which can improve spectral efficiency of wireless
radio access. With SCMA, different incoming data streams are directly mapped to
codewords of different multi-dimensional cookbooks, where each codeword
represents a spread transmission layer. Multiple SCMA layers share the same
time-frequency resources of OFDMA. The sparsity of codewords makes the
near-optimal detection feasible through iterative message passing algorithm
(MPA). Such low complexity of multi-layer detection allows excessive codeword
overloading in which the dimension of multiplexed layers exceeds the dimension
of codewords. Optimization of overloading factor along with modulation-coding
levels of layers provides a more flexible and efficient link-adaptation
mechanism. On the other hand, the signal spreading feature of SCMA can improve
link-adaptation as a result of less colored interference. In this paper a
technique is developed to enable multi-user SCMA (MU-SCMA) for downlink
wireless access. User pairing, power sharing, rate adjustment, and scheduling
algorithms are designed to improve the downlink throughput of a heavily loaded
network. The advantage of SCMA spreading for lightly loaded networks is also
evaluated.
