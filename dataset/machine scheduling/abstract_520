A control software verification framework for gas turbine engines is
developed. A stability proof is presented for gain scheduled closed-loop engine
system based on global linearization and linear matrix inequality (LMI)
techniques. Using convex optimization tools, a single quadratic Lyapunov
function is computed for multiple linearizations near equilibrium points of the
closed-loop system. With the computed stability matrices, ellipsoid invariant
sets are constructed, which are used efficiently for DGEN turbofan engine
control code stability analysis. Then a verifiable linear gain scheduled
controller for DGEN engine is developed based on formal methods, and tested on
the engine virtual test bench. Simulation results show that the developed
verifiable gain scheduled controller is capable of regulating the engine in a
stable fashion with proper tracking performance.
