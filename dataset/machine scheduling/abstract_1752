High-throughput density-functional calculations of solids are extremely time
consuming. As an alternative, we here propose a machine learning approach for
the fast prediction of solid-state properties. To achieve this, LSDA
calculations are used as training set. We focus on predicting metallic vs.
insulating behavior, and on predicting the value of the density of electronic
states at the Fermi energy. We find that conventional representations of the
input data, such as the Coulomb matrix, are not suitable for the training of
learning machines in the case of periodic solids. We propose a novel crystal
structure representation for which learning and competitive prediction
accuracies become possible within an unrestricted class of spd systems. Due to
magnetic phenomena learning on d systems is found more difficult than in pure
sp systems.
