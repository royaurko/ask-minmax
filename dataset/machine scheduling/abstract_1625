This chapter describes componentwise Least Squares Support Vector Machines
(LS-SVMs) for the estimation of additive models consisting of a sum of
nonlinear components. The primal-dual derivations characterizing LS-SVMs for
the estimation of the additive model result in a single set of linear equations
with size growing in the number of data-points. The derivation is elaborated
for the classification as well as the regression case. Furthermore, different
techniques are proposed to discover structure in the data by looking for sparse
components in the model based on dedicated regularization schemes on the one
hand and fusion of the componentwise LS-SVMs training with a validation
criterion on the other hand. (keywords: LS-SVMs, additive models,
