We study probabilistic protocols for concurrent threshold-based load
balancing in networks. There are n resources or machines represented by nodes
in an undirected graph and m >> n users that try to find an acceptable resource
by moving along the edges of the graph. Users accept a resource if the load is
below a threshold. Such thresholds have an intuitive meaning, e.g., as
deadlines in a machine scheduling scenario, and they allow the design of
protocols under strong locality constraints. When migration is partly
controlled by resources and partly by users, our protocols obtain rapid
convergence to a balanced state, in which all users are satisfied. We show that
convergence is achieved in a number of rounds that is only logarithmic in m and
polynomial in structural properties of the graph. Even when migration is fully
controlled by users, we obtain similar results for convergence to approximately
balanced states. If we slightly adjust the migration probabilities in our
protocol, we can also obtain fast convergence to balanced states.
