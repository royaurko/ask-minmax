In this paper we propose an Intelligent Management System which is capable of
managing the automobile functions using the rigorous real-time principles and a
multicore processor in order to realize higher efficiency and safety for the
vehicle. It depicts how various automobile functionalities can be fine grained
and treated to fit in real time concepts. It also shows how the modern
multicore processors can be of good use in organizing vast amounts of
correlated functions to be executed in real-time with excellent time
commitments. The modeling of the automobile tasks with real time commitments,
organizing appropriate scheduling for various real time tasks and the usage of
a multicore processor enables the system to realize higher efficiency and offer
better safety levels to the vehicle. The industry available real time operating
system is used for scheduling various tasks and jobs on the multicore
processor.
