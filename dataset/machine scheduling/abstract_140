The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) will make precise astrometric
measurements that can be used to detect planets around nearby stars. Since
observational time will be extremely valuable, it is important to consider how
the choice of the observing schedule influences the efficiency of SIM planet
searches. We have conducted Monte Carlo simulations of astrometric observations
to understand the effects of different scheduling algorithms. We find that the
efficiency of planet searches is relatively insensitive to the observing
schedule for most reasonable observing schedules.
