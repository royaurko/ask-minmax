Suppose that wirelessly communicating sensors are placed in a regular fashion
on the points of a lattice. Common communication protocols allow the sensors to
broadcast messages at arbitrary times, which can lead to problems should two
sensors broadcast at the same time. It is shown that one can exploit a tiling
of the lattice to derive a deterministic periodic schedule for the broadcast
communication of sensors that is guaranteed to be collision-free. The proposed
schedule is shown to be optimal in the number of time slots.
