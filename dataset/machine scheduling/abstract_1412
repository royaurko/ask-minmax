This paper introduces a special type of systems, defines their properties,
and then demonstrates that a reduction machine for pure untyped extensional
lambda calculus can be implemented as a system of the introduced type.
Specifically, we discuss uniform memory as a special kind of graphs and real
time operation of state machines that use the uniform memory as their state.
Also, we consider a special case of serialization, the latter being useful for
the mechanism that compares results during computation, not after the
computation is done. However, we start with detailed explanation of our
motivation for this work.
