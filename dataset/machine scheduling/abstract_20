This paper presents different methods for solving parallel machine scheduling
problems with precedence constraints and setup times between the jobs. Limited
discrepancy search methods mixed with local search principles, dominance
conditions and specific lower bounds are proposed. The proposed methods are
evaluated on a set of randomly generated instances and compared with previous
results from the literature and those obtained with an efficient commercial
solver. We conclude that our propositions are quite competitive and our results
even outperform other approaches in most cases.
