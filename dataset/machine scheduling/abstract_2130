This is a brief summary of a talk delivered at the Special Session of the
Physical Sciences Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 25 May
2011. The meeting was devoted to the 90-th anniversary of A. D. Sakharov. The
focus of this contribution is on the standing-wave pattern of
quantum-mechanically generated metric (gravitational field) perturbations as
the origin of subsequent Sakharov oscillations in the matter power spectrum.
Other related phenomena, particularly in the area of gravitational waves, and
their observational significance are also discussed.
