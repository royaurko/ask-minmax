We discuss the approach to investigation of molecular machines using systems
of integro--differential ultrametric (p-adic) reaction--diffusion equations
with drift. This approach combines the features of continuous and discrete
dynamic models. We apply this model to investigation of actomyosin molecular
motor.
  The introduced system of equations is solved analytically using p-adic
wavelet theory. We find explicit stationary solutions and behavior in the
relaxation regime.
