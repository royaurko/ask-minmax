Machine Learning is usually defined as a subfield of AI, which is busy with
information extraction from raw data sets. Despite of its common acceptance and
widespread recognition, this definition is wrong and groundless. Meaningful
information does not belong to the data that bear it. It belongs to the
observers of the data and it is a shared agreement and a convention among them.
Therefore, this private information cannot be extracted from the data by any
means. Therefore, all further attempts of Machine Learning apologists to
justify their funny business are inappropriate.
