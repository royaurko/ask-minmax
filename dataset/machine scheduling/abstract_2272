This paper investigates how concepts from game theory and ICT can contribute
to solve challenges in demand side management, an important concept in the
upcoming smart grid. Demand side management is about modifying the energy load
distribution on the demand side, for example in order to reduce peaks in energy
usage. This can be done by shifting energy demands where possible. We start
with describing a number of smart grid concepts and assumptions (smart meters,
pricing, appliance scheduling) and explain the advantages demand side
management has. After the introduction of game theoretic concepts, it becomes
possible to mathematically describe the demand side management problem. Next
step is to solve the mathematical formulation, and show how complex demand side
management becomes if the number of energy users increases. By means of
distributed ICT algorithms however, it is possible to still find a solution.
Based on existing literature, different algorithms are studied. Though results
in literature looked promising, several conclusions on convergence of the
algorithm in general, and convergence towards the most optimal results in
particular are challenged.
