The LISA PathFinder DMU (Data Management Unit) flight model was formally
accepted by ESA and ASD on 11 February 2010, after all hardware and software
tests had been successfully completed. The diagnostics items are scheduled to
be delivered by the end of 2010. In this paper we review the requirements and
performance of this instrumentation, specially focusing on the Radiation
Monitor and the DMU, as well as the status of their programmed use during
mission operations, on which work is ongoing at the time of writing.
