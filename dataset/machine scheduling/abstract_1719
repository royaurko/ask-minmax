The field of human-centered computing has known a major progress these past
few years. It is admitted that this field is multidisciplinary and that the
human is the core of the system. It shows two matters of concern:
multidisciplinary and human. The first one reveals that each discipline plays
an important role in the global research and that the collaboration between
everyone is needed. The second one explains that a growing number of researches
aims at making the human commitment degree increase by giving him/her a
decisive role in the human-machine interaction. This paper focuses on these
both concerns and presents MICE (Machines Interaction Control in their
Environment) which is a system where the human is the one who makes the
decisions to manage the interaction with the machines. In an ambient context,
the human can decide of objects actions by creating interaction scenarios with
a new visual programming language: scenL.
