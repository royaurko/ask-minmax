DEEP is a two-phase spectral survey of faint field galaxies with the Keck
Telescopes. The goals include exploring galaxy formation and evolution, mapping
distant large scale structures, and constraining cosmology. DEEP, since its
inception in the early 1990's, has been distinguished by an emphasis on
studying the kinematics and masses of distant galaxies. The major DEEP survey
in the second phase (DEEP2) is scheduled to begin in 2002 using a new
spectrograph and will mainly aim for a sample of 50,000 galaxies to I ~ 23.
Until then, the first phase of DEEP science programs will have been
concentrating on using existing Keck spectrographs to undertake spectral
surveys of over 1000 galaxies that have also been observed with HST. I will
highlight the study of rotation curves of distant spirals; the fundamental
plane of faint, high-redshift E/S0s; the narrow velocity widths seen in
luminous blue compact galaxies; and the diversity of kinematics seen in a small
sample of high redshift (z ~ 3) galaxies. These DEEP pilot programs have
clearly demonstrated the feasibility, importance, and potential of using
kinematics to better understand distant galaxies.
