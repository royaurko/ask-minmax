In this paper, we describe the architecture and performance of the GRAPE-6
system, a massively-parallel special-purpose computer for astrophysical
$N$-body simulations. GRAPE-6 is the successor of GRAPE-4, which was completed
in 1995 and achieved the theoretical peak speed of 1.08 Tflops. As was the case
with GRAPE-4, the primary application of GRAPE-6 is simulation of collisional
systems, though it can be used for collisionless systems. The main differences
between GRAPE-4 and GRAPE-6 are (a) The processor chip of GRAPE-6 integrates 6
force-calculation pipelines, compared to one pipeline of GRAPE-4 (which needed
3 clock cycles to calculate one interaction), (b) the clock speed is increased
from 32 to 90 MHz, and (c) the total number of processor chips is increased
from 1728 to 2048. These improvements resulted in the peak speed of 64 Tflops.
We also discuss the design of the successor of GRAPE-6.
