We apply a general method for the estimation of completely positive maps to
the 1-to-2 universal covariant cloning machine. The method is based on the
maximum-likelihood principle, and makes use of random input states, along with
random projective measurements on the output clones. The downhill simplex
algorithm is applied for the maximisation of the likelihood functional.
