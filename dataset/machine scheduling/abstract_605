In this paper it is argued that a particular kind of mechanical process
called mechanical abstractional process offers capabilities that surpass those
of a general mechanical process (e.g., Turing machines). Abstractional
machines, which follow a mechanical abstractional process, are defined, and it
is proved that an abstractional machine is able to solve NP-complete problems
in polynomial time. This result together with the provided evidence that shows
the newly defined process as a purely mechanical process supports a relevant
consequence of this work, that is, P = NP.
