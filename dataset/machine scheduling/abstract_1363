We present a parallel machine, based on programmable devices, dedicated to
simulate spin glass models with Z2 variables and short range interaction. A
working prototype is described for two lattices containing 312x312 spins each
with an update time of 50 ns per spin. The final version of the three
dimensional parallel machine is discussed with spin update time up to 312 ps.
