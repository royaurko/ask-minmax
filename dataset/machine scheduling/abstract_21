In this paper, a discrete state transition algorithm is introduced to solve a
multiobjective single machine job shop scheduling problem. In the proposed
approach, a non-dominated sort technique is used to select the best from a
candidate state set, and a Pareto archived strategy is adopted to keep all the
non-dominated solutions. Compared with the enumeration and other heuristics,
experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the multiobjective
state transition algorithm.
