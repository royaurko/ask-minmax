We consider online scheduling weighted packets with time constraints over a
fading channel. Packets arrive at the transmitter in an online manner. Each
packet has a value and a deadline by which it should be sent. The fade state of
the channel determines the throughput obtained per unit of time and the
channel's quality may change over time. In this paper, we design online
algorithms to maximize weighted throughput, defined as the total value of the
packets sent by their respective deadlines. Competitive ratio is employed to
measure an online algorithm's performance. For this problem and one of its
variants, we present two online algorithms with competitive ratios 2.618 and 2
respectively.
