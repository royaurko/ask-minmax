This paper illustrates a technique for specifying the detailed timing,
logical operation, and compositional circuit design of digital circuits in
terms of ordinary state machines with output (transducers). The method is
illustrated here with specifications of gates, latches, and other simple
circuits and via the construction of devices starting with a SR latch built
from gates and then moving on to more complex devices. Circuit timing and
transients are treated in some detail. The method is based on "classical"
automata and recursive functions on strings. No formal methods, extended state
machines, or process algebras are involved but a reference is made to potential
applications of the Krohn-Rhodes theorem and other group/monoid based algebraic
techniques.
