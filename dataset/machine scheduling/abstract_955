The use of "handy singularities" (i.e. singularities similar to those arising
in the Deutch-Politzer space) enables one to avoid (almost) all known
difficulties inherent usually to creation of time machines. A simple method is
discussed for constructing a variety of such singularities. A few 3-dimensional
examples are cited.
