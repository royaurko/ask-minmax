We study machines that take N identical replicas of a pure qudit state as
input and output a set of M_A clones of a given fidelity and another set of
$M_B$ clones of another fidelity. The trade-off between these two fidelities is
investigated, and numerous examples of optimal N -> M_A+M_B cloning machines
are exhibited using a generic method. A generalisation to more than two sets of
clones is also discussed. Finally, an optical implementation of some such
machines is proposed. This paper is an extended version of
[xxx.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411179].
