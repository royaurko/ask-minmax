We study the minimal thermodynamically consistent model for an adaptive
machine that transfers particles from a higher chemical potential reservoir to
a lower one. This model describes essentials of the inhomogeneous catalysis. It
is supposed to function with the maximal current under uncertain chemical
potentials: if they change, the machine tunes its own structure fitting it to
the maximal current under new conditions. This adaptation is possible under two
limitations. (i) The degree of freedom that controls the machine's structure
has to have a stored energy (described via a negative temperature). The origin
of this result is traced back to the Le Chatelier principle. (ii) The machine
has to malfunction at a constant environment due to structural fluctuations,
whose relative magnitude is controlled solely by the stored energy. We argue
that several features of the adaptive machine are similar to those of living
organisms (energy storage, aging).
