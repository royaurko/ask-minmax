Behavior-Interaction-Priority (BIP) is a layered embedded system design and
verification framework that provides separation of functionality,
synchronization, and priority concerns to simplify system design and to
establish correctness by construction. The framework comes with a runtime
engine and a suite of verification tools that uses D-Finder and NuSMV as model
checkers. In this paper we provide a method and a supporting tool that takes a
BIP system and a set of invariants and computes a reduced sequential circuit
with a system-specific scheduler and with a designated output that is true when
the invariants hold. Our method uses ABC, a sequential circuit synthesis and
verification framework to (1) generate an efficient FPGA implementation of the
system, and to (2) verify the system and debug it in case a counterexample was
found. Moreover we generate a concurrent C implementation of the circuit that
can be directly used as a simulator. We evaluated our method with two large
systems and our results outperform those possible with existing techniques.
