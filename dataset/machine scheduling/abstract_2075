Embedded real-time applications in communication systems require high
processing power. Manual scheduling devel-oped for single-processor
applications is not suited to multi-core architectures. The Algorithm
Architecture Matching (AAM) methodology optimizes static application
implementation on multi-core architectures. The Random Access Channel Preamble
Detection (RACH-PD) is an algorithm for non-synchronized access of Long Term
Evolu-tion (LTE) wireless networks. LTE aims to improve the spectral efficiency
of the next generation cellular system. This paper de-scribes a complete
methodology for implementing the RACH-PD. AAM prototyping is applied to the
RACH-PD which is modelled as a Synchronous DataFlow graph (SDF). An efficient
implemen-tation of the algorithm onto a multi-core DSP, the TI C6487, is then
explained. Benchmarks for the solution are given.
