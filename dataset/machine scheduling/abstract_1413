We investigate the effect of anomalous gamma-W-W couplings in e-gamma --> nu
W through the angular and energy spectrum of the secondary leptons. Within the
narrow-width approximation, a semi-analytical study of the secondary lepton
energy-angle double distribution is considered. Utility of observables derived
from this is demonstrated by considering the anomalous coupling,
delta-kappa-gamma. Results of our investigation for typical ILC machine
considered at Ecm = 300-1000 GeV re-affirms potential of this collider as a
precision machine.
