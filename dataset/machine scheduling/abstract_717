High speed machining has been improved thanks to considerable advancement on
the tools (optimum geometry, harder materials), on machined materials
(increased workability and machining capacity for harder workpieces) and
finally on the machines (higher accuracy and power at the high speeds,
performances of the numerical control system). However at such loading
velocities, the cutting process generates high strain and high-speed strain
which cause complex, various and irreversible phenomena in plasticity. These
phenomena are comprehended through the complete measurement of the mechanical
actions using a six-component dynamometer and flux and temperatures
measurements at the tip of the cutting tool. Balanced energy assessments are
the starting points of our reflection on the machining modelling. The modelling
of these phenomena and the material behaviour under this type of loading
requires a suitable theoretical approach. The main points of the strain
gradient theory are developed. A theoretical behaviour law adapted to the
cutting phenomena is then expressed.
