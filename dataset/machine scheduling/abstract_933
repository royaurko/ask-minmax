The hypothesis that direct human intention can modulate the concurrent
outcomes of a stochastic process has been under test for over 35 years,
surrounded by inconclusive evidence and a great amount of ambiguity. An
increased interest has recently and prematurely risen concerning possible
scientific applications of such effects. The amassed information around the
purported phenomena, as presented in a meta-analysis, is thoroughly re-examined
here through the application of several recognised mathematical tools. It is
shown that there exists no validation of the hypothesis of brain-machine
interaction precisely in absence of interface devices. It is concluded that any
evidence in favour of the alleged intangible brain-machine effects, must have
resulted from unintended errors during data collection and treatment, known as
the experimenter expectancy effect.
