Cloud Computing Datacenters host millions of virtual machines (VMs) on real
world scenarios. In this context, Virtual Machine Placement (VMP) is one of the
most challenging problems in cloud infrastructure management, considering also
the large number of possible optimization criteria and different formulations
that could be studied. VMP literature include relevant topics such as
energy-efficiency, Service Level Agreements (SLA), cloud service markets,
Quality of Service (QoS) and carbon dioxide emissions, all of them with high
economical and ecological impact. This work presents an extensive up-to-date
review of the most relevant VMP literature in order to identify research
opportunities.
