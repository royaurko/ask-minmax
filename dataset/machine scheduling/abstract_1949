The Astro-E2 high resolution X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) is expected to provide
a major enhancement in study of clusters of galaxies. Astro-E2 is the fifth
Japanese X-ray astronomy observatory, which is scheduled for launch in early
2005. The XRS instrument, developed under a Japan-US collaboration, is an X-ray
microcalorimeter with a capability of observing extended objects, and a high
energy resolution of about 6 eV at 6 keV. The spectral resolving power is 20
times higher than CCDs over the 0.5-10 keV energy band. We have obtained
several new results of clusters with Chandra and XMM, which show that
high-resolution imaging spectroscopy can clarify some outstanding questions.
New sciences from Astro-E2 include the first clear measurement of gas
velocities, determination of ion and electron temperatures, and electron
densities based on the resolved line features. We will describe the XRS
instrument design, and present simulations of the expected performance.
