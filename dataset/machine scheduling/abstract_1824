Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an extremely fast learning method and has a
powerful performance for pattern recognition tasks proven by enormous
researches and engineers. However, its good generalization ability is built on
large numbers of hidden neurons, which is not beneficial to real time response
in the test process. In this paper, we proposed new ways, named "constrained
extreme learning machines" (CELMs), to randomly select hidden neurons based on
sample distribution. Compared to completely random selection of hidden nodes in
ELM, the CELMs randomly select hidden nodes from the constrained vector space
containing some basic combinations of original sample vectors. The experimental
results show that the CELMs have better generalization ability than traditional
ELM, SVM and some other related methods. Additionally, the CELMs have a similar
fast learning speed as ELM.
