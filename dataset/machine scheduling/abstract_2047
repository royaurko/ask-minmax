The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is scheduled to commence operation in
2008 and inclusive searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) will be one of our primary
tasks in the first days of LHC operation. It is certain that the final state of
multijets + missing transverse energy will provide a superior performance in
SUSY searches. Strategies to understand the instrumental background and to
understand the Standard Model (SM) background are still under development and
are urgent issues for the coming data. We describe the strategy for early SUSY
searches at the ATLAS experiment using the fist data corresponding to an
integrated luminosity up to 1fb^-1, which comprises much progress in the
data-driven technique for the SM background estimations.
