We present a novel characterization of how a program stresses cache. This
characterization permits fast performance prediction in order to simulate and
assist task scheduling on heterogeneous clusters. It is based on the estimation
of stack distance probability distributions. The analysis requires the
observation of a very small subset of memory accesses, and yields a reasonable
to very accurate prediction in constant time.
