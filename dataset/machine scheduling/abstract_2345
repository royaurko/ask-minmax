We pose the following question: If a physical experiment were to be
completely controlled by an algorithm, what effect would the algorithm have on
the physical measurements made possible by the experiment?
  In a programme to study the nature of computation possible by physical
systems, and by algorithms coupled with physical systems, we have begun to
analyse (i) the algorithmic nature of experimental procedures, and (ii) the
idea of using a physical experiment as an oracle to Turing Machines. To answer
the question, we will extend our theory of experimental oracles in order to use
Turing machines to model the experimental procedures that govern the conduct of
physical experiments. First, we specify an experiment that measures mass via
collisions in Newtonian Dynamics; we examine its properties in preparation for
its use as an oracle. We start to classify the computational power of
polynomial time Turing machines with this experimental oracle using non-uniform
complexity classes. Second, we show that modelling an experimenter and
experimental procedure algorithmically imposes a limit on what can be measured
with equipment. Indeed, the theorems suggest a new form of uncertainty
principle for our knowledge of physical quantities measured in simple physical
experiments. We argue that the results established here are representative of a
huge class of experiments.
