We review the status of the AMANDA neutrino telescope. We present results
obtained from the four-string prototype array AMANDA-B4 and describe the
methods of track reconstruction and neutrino event separation. We give also
first results of the analysis of the 10-string detector AMANDA-B10, in
particular on atmospheric neutrinos and the search for magnetic monopoles. We
sketch the future schedule on the way to a cube kilometer telescope at the
South Pole, ICECUBE
