Many sciences have made significant breakthroughs by adopting online tools
that help organize, structure and mine information that is too detailed to be
printed in journals. In this paper, we introduce OpenML, a place for machine
learning researchers to share and organize data in fine detail, so that they
can work more effectively, be more visible, and collaborate with others to
tackle harder problems. We discuss how OpenML relates to other examples of
networked science and what benefits it brings for machine learning research,
individual scientists, as well as students and practitioners.
