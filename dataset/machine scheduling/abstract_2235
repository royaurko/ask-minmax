Process checkpoint-restart is a technology with great potential for use in
HEP workflows. Use cases include debugging, reducing the startup time of
applications both in offline batch jobs and the High Level Trigger, permitting
job preemption in environments where spare CPU cycles are being used
opportunistically and efficient scheduling of a mix of multicore and
single-threaded jobs. We report on tests of checkpoint-restart technology using
CMS software, Geant4-MT (multi-threaded Geant4), and the DMTCP (Distributed
Multithreaded Checkpointing) package. We analyze both single- and
multi-threaded applications and test on both standard Intel x86 architectures
and on Intel MIC. The tests with multi-threaded applications on Intel MIC are
used to consider scalability and performance. These are considered an indicator
of what the future may hold for many-core computing.
