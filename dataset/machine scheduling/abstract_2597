For a spectrum $X$ represented by a special $\Gamma$-space $Y$ via the Segal
machine, we give an elementary formula computing the homology groups of $X$ in
terms of $Y$. Both the result and the method of proof are essentially due to T.
Pirashvili, but the end result does not appear explicitly in his papers.
