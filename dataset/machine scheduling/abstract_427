We introduce a dynamical annealing schedule for population-based optimization
algorithms with mutation. On the basis of a statistical mechanics formulation
of the population dynamics, the mutation rate adapts to a value maximizing
expected rewards at each time step. Thereby, the mutation rate is eliminated as
a free parameter from the algorithm.
