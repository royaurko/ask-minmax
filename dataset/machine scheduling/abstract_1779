In recent years, the use of machine learning classifiers is of great value in
solving a variety of problems in text classification. Sentiment mining is a
kind of text classification in which, messages are classified according to
sentiment orientation such as positive or negative. This paper extends the idea
of evaluating the performance of various classifiers to show their
effectiveness in sentiment mining of online product reviews. The product
reviews are collected from Amazon reviews. To evaluate the performance of
classifiers various evaluation methods like random sampling, linear sampling
and bootstrap sampling are used. Our results shows that support vector machine
with bootstrap sampling method outperforms others classifiers and sampling
methods in terms of misclassification rate.
