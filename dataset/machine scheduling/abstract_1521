The purpose of this report is in examining the generalization performance of
Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a tool for pattern recognition and object
classification. The work is motivated by the growing popularity of the method
that is claimed to guarantee a good generalization performance for the task in
hand. The method is implemented in MATLAB. SVMs based on various kernels are
tested for classifying data from various domains.
