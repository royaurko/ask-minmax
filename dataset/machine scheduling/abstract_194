Conventional heterogeneous-traffic scheduling schemes utilize zero-delay
constraint for real-time services, which aims to minimize the average packet
delay among real-time users. However, in light or moderate load networks this
strategy is unnecessary and leads to low data throughput for non-real-time
users. In this paper, we propose a heuristic scheduling scheme to solve this
problem. The scheme measures and assigns scheduling priorities to both
real-time and non-real-time users, and schedules the radio resources for the
two user classes simultaneously. Simulation results show that the proposed
scheme efficiently handles the heterogeneous-traffic scheduling with diverse
QoS requirements and alleviates the unfairness between real-time and
non-real-time services under various traffic loads.
