This paper introduces a knowledge recognition algorithm (KRA) that is both a
Turing machine algorithm and an Oracle Turing machine algorithm. By definition
KRA is a non-deterministic language recognition algorithm. Simultaneously it
can be implemented as a deterministic Turing machine algorithm. KRA applies
mirrored perceptual-conceptual languages to learn member-class relations
between the two languages iteratively and retrieve information through
deductive and reductive recognition from one language to another. The novelty
of KRA is that the conventional concept of relation is adjusted. The
computation therefore becomes efficient bidirectional string mapping.
