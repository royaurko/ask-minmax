In a recent work (arXiv:0910.2517), for nonlinear models with sparse
underlying linear structures, we studied the error bounds of
$\ell_0$-regularized estimation. In this note, we show that
$\ell_1$-regularized estimation in some important cases can achieve the same
order of error bounds as those in the aforementioned work.
