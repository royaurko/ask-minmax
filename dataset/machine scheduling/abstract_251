We consider scheduling strategies for point-to-multipoint (PMP) storage area
networks (SANs) that use network coded storage (NCS). In particular, we present
a simple SAN system model, two server scheduling algorithms for PMP networks,
and analytical expressions for internal and external blocking probability. We
point to select scheduling advantages in NCS systems under normal operating
conditions, where content requests can be temporarily denied owing to finite
system capacity from drive I/O access or storage redundancy limitations. NCS
can lead to improvements in throughput and blocking probability due to
increased immediate scheduling options, and complements other well documented
NCS advantages such as regeneration, and can be used as a guide for future
storage system design.
