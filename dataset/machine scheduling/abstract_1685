Attempts to install a rotating tool at the end of a robot arm
poly-articulated date back twenty years, but these robots were not designed for
that. Indeed, two essential features are necessary for machining: high rigidity
and precision in a given workspace. The experimental results presented are the
dynamic identification of a poly-articulated robot equipped with an integrated
spindle. This study aims to highlight the influence of the geometric
configuration of the robot arm on the overall stiffness of the system. The
spindle is taken into account as an additional weight on board but also as a
dynamical excitation for the robot KUKA KR_240_2. Study of the robotic
machining vibrations shows the suitable directions of movement in milling
