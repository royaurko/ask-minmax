We show how the machine of PROP profiles invented by S. Merkulov can be used
to study and classify natural operators in differential geometry. We also give
an interpretation of graph complexes arising in this context in terms of
representation theory. As application, we prove several results on
classification of natural operators acting on vector fields and connections.
