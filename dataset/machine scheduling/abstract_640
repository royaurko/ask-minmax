MILJS is a collection of state-of-the-art, platform-independent, scalable,
fast JavaScript libraries for matrix calculation and machine learning. Our core
library offering a matrix calculation is called Sushi, which exhibits far
better performance than any other leading machine learning libraries written in
JavaScript. Especially, our matrix multiplication is 177 times faster than the
fastest JavaScript benchmark. Based on Sushi, a machine learning library called
Tempura is provided, which supports various algorithms widely used in machine
learning research. We also provide Soba as a visualization library. The
implementations of our libraries are clearly written, properly documented and
thus can are easy to get started with, as long as there is a web browser. These
libraries are available from http://mil-tokyo.github.io/ under the MIT license.
