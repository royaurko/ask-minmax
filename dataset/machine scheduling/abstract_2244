This paper presents a new framework for controller robustness verification
with respect to F-16 aircraft's closed-loop performance in longitudinal flight.
We compare the state regulation performance of a linear quadratic regulator
(LQR) and a gain-scheduled linear quadratic regulator (gsLQR), applied to
nonlinear open-loop dynamics of F-16, in presence of stochastic initial
condition and parametric uncertainties, as well as actuator disturbance. We
show that, in presence of initial condition uncertainties alone, both LQR and
gsLQR have comparable immediate and asymptotic performances, but the gsLQR
exhibits better transient performance at intermediate times. This remains true
in the presence of additional actuator disturbance. Also, gsLQR is shown to be
more robust than LQR, against parametric uncertainties. The probabilistic
framework proposed here, leverages transfer operator based density computation
in exact arithmetic and introduces optimal transport theoretic performance
validation and verification (V&V) for nonlinear dynamical systems. Numerical
results from our proposed method, are in unison with Monte Carlo simulations.
