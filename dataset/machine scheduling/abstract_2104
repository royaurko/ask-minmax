The chapter describes the modeling of a material handling system with the
production of individual units in a scheduled order. The units represent the
agents in the model and are transported in the system which is abstracted as a
directed graph. Since the hindrances of units on their path to the destination
can lead to inefficiencies in the production, the blockages of units are to be
reduced. Therefore, the units operate in the system by means of local
interactions in the conveying elements and indirect interactions based on a
measure of possible hindrances. If most of the units behave cooperatively
("socially"), the blockings in the system are reduced.
  A simulation based on the model shows the collective behavior of the units in
the system. The transport processes in the simulation can be compared with the
processes in a real plant, which gives conclusions about the consequencies for
the production based on the superordinate planning.
