Commercially available scheduling tools such as Primavera and Microsoft
Project fail to provide information pertaining to the spatial aspects of
construction project. A methodology using geographical information systems
(GIS) is developed to represent spatial aspects of the construction progress
graphically by synchronizing it with construction schedule. The spatial aspects
are depicted by 3D model developed in AutoCAD and construction schedule is
generated using Microsoft Excel. Spatial and scheduling information are linked
together into the GIS environment (ArcGIS). The GIS-based system developed in
this study may help in better understanding the schedule along with its spatial
aspects.
