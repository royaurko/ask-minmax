Volume 2719 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 624-636 Date: 18 June 2003 A Competitive Algorithm for the General 2-Server Problem René A. Sitters Affiliated with Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven , Leen Stougie Affiliated with Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven CWI , Willem E. de Paepe Affiliated with Department of Technology Management, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven We consider the general on-line two server problem in which at each step both servers receive a request, which is a point in a metric space. One of the servers has to be moved to its request. The special case where the requests are points on the real line is known as the CNN-problem. It has been a well-known open question if an algorithm with a constant competitive ratio exists for this problem. We answer this question in the affirmative sense by providing the first constant competitive algorithm for the general two-server problem on any metric space.
