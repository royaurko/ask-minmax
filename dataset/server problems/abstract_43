Volume 5420 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 15-26 A Higher-Order Graph Calculus for Autonomic Computing Oana Andrei Affiliated with Lancaster University INRIA Nancy Grand-Est & LORIA , Hélène Kirchner Affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest In this paper, we present a high-level formalism based on port graph rewriting, strategic rewriting, and rewriting calculus. We argue that this formalism is suitable for modeling autonomic systems and briefly illustrate its expressivity for modeling properties of such systems.
