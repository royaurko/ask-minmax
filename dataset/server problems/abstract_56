Scaling data centers to handle task-parallel work-loads requires balancing the cost of hardware, operations, and power. Low-power, low-core-count servers reduce costs in one of these dimensions, but may require additional nodes to provide the required quality of service or increase costs by under-utilizing memory and other resources. We show that the throughput, response time, and power consumption of a high-core-count processor operating at a low clock rate and very low power consumption can perform well when compared to a platform using faster but fewer commodity cores. Specific measurements are made for a key-value store, Memcached, using a variety of systems based on three different processors: the 4-core Intel Xeon L5520, 8-core AMD Opteron 6128 HE, and 64-core Tilera TILEPro64.
