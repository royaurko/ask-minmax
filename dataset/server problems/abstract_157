In the e-commerce environment, the protection of users' privacy from a server was not considered feasible until the private information retrieval (PIR) problem was stated and solved. In this paper, we propose a one-server PIR scheme based on a knapsack problem, it is more suitable than other previous PIR schemes in the real e-commerce environment. In addition, a security proof to our scheme and comparisons to other PIR schemes are given.
