The authors prove a lower bound of Ω(√log k /loglog k ) for the competitive ratio of randomized algorithms for the k -server problem against an oblivious adversary. The bound holds for arbitrary metric spaces (of at least k +1 points) and provides a new lower bound for the metrical task system problem as well. This improves the previous best lower bound of Ω(loglog k ) for arbitrary metric spaces, more closely approaching the conjectured lower bound of Ω(log k ). They also prove a lower bound of Ω( logk / loglogk ) for the server problem on k +1 equally-spaced points on a line, which corresponds to some natural motion-planning problems
