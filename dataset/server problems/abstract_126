The first general decomposition theorem for the k -server problem is presented. Whereas all previous theorems are for the case of a finite metric with k +1 points, the theorem given here allows an arbitrary number of points in the underlying metric space. This theorem implies O (polylog( k ))-competitive randomized algorithms for certain metric spaces consisting of a polylogarithmic number of widely separated subspaces and takes a first step toward a general O (polylog( k ))-competitive algorithm. The only other cases for which polylogarithmic competitive randomized algorithms are known are the uniform metric space and the weighted cache metric space with two weights.
