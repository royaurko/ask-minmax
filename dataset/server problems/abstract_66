The request issued at each step is specified by a point r in a given metric space M . To serve this request, one of the k servers must move to r . (We assume that k ≥ 2.) It is known that if M has at least k + 1 points then no online algorithm for the k -Server Problem in M has competitive ratio smaller than k . The best known upper bound on the competitive ratio in arbitrary metric spaces, by Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [ 6 ], is 2 k -1. There is only a number of special cases for which k-competitive algorithms are known: for k = 2, when M is a tree, or when M has at most k + 2 points. The main result of this paper is that theWork Function Algorithm is 3-competitive for the 3-Server Problem in the Manhattan plane.As a corollary,we obtain a 4:243- competitive algorithm for 3 servers in the Euclidean plane. The best previously known competitive ratio for 3 servers in these spaces was 5. Research supported by NSF grant CCR-9503441.
