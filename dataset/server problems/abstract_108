More specifically, we assume that the adversary has only half at many servers at each site as the online algorithm. We show that the halfopt-competitive ratio for the greedy algorithm is θ(min( m , log C )), where m is the number of server sites, and C is the total number of servers. We then present an algorithm Balance , which is a simple modification of the greedy algorithm, that has a halfopt-competitive ratio of O (1). Supported in part by NSF under grant CCR-9202158.
