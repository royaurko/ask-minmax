Volume 7164 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 198-210 On Online Algorithms with Advice for the k -Server Problem Marc P. Renault Affiliated with Lancaster University LIAFA, Univerité Paris Diderot UPMC , Adi Rosén Affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University CNRS and Univerité Paris Diderot We consider the model of online computation with advice [5]. In particular, we study the k -server problem under this model. We prove two upper bounds for this problem. First, we show a \(\Big\lceil\frac{\lceil\log k\rceil}{b-2}\Big\rceil \) -competitive online algorithm for general metric spaces with b bits of advice per request, where 3 ≤  b  ≤ log k . This improves upon the recent result of [1]. Moreover, we believe that our algorithm and our analysis are more intuitive and simpler than those of [1]. Second, we give a 1-competitive online algorithm for trees which uses 2 + 2⌈log( p  + 1)⌉ bits of advice per request, where p is the caterpillar dimension of the tree.
