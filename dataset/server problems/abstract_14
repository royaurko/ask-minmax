In the k -server problem we wish to minimize, in an online fashion, the movement cost of k servers in response to a sequence of requests (we assume that k⩾2 ). The request issued at each step is specified by a point r in a given metric space M . To serve this request, one of the k servers must move to r . It is known that if M has at least k+1 points then no online algorithm for the k -server problem in M has competitive ratio smaller than k . The best known upper bound on the competitive ratio in arbitrary metric spaces, by Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou (J. ACM 42 (1995) 971), is 2k−1 . There are only a few special cases for which k -competitive algorithms are known: for k=2 , when M is a tree, or when M has at most k+2 points. We prove that the Work Function Algorithm is 3-competitive for the 3-server problem in the Manhattan plane. As a corollary, we obtain a 4.243 -competitive algorithm for 3 servers in the Euclidean plane. The best previously known competitive ratio for 3 servers in these metric spaces was 5.
