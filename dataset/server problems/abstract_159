Small size of the sensor nodes put constraint on the hardware capabilities and battery supported on it. Though power optimization is a real challenge in all WSN applications, power saving at the cost of data loss is not at all preferable. Very small buffer sizes cannot store the increased data arrival at the time of event occurrences and data gets lost due to buffer overflow. Data loss within the node occurs before transmission mainly either data gets timed out or due to buffer overflows. Both of these situations can be handled using CAP management techniques at individual sensor nodes. Here Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Dynamic Modulation Scaling (DMS) techniques are used for optimization of power consumed by processor and transmitter respectively. We have considered that DVFS and DMS are coordinated together so that whenever processor changes its processing speed, transmitter also changes its transmission rate and minimum data loss occurs at the intermediate buffer. In this paper we have discussed adaptive threshold policy for selecting a particular state of sensor node and compared the results with fixed threshold policy. CAP management along with adaptive threshold policy improves the lifetime of sensor nodes and also reduces the data loss before transmission.
