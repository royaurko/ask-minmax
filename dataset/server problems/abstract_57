We investigate loss-based overload control, as proposed in recent IETF documents. The queuing model takes into account three types of system state – normal load, overload, and discard. The hysteretic control is made possible by introducing two thresholds in the buffer of total size B  – the overload onset threshold H and the overload abatement threshold L . We denote the mathematical model using the modified Kendall notation as an \(M|G|1|\left\langle L,H\right\rangle |B\) queue with hysteretic load control. We also develop an analytical model for the case of an M | M |1 queue and a simulation model for an M | D |1 queue. We investigate the return time from an overload state as the target performance measure of overload control in a SIP server, and provide numerical examples in order to examine the difference between the M | M |1 and M | D |1 systems.
