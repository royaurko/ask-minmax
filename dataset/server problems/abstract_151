This paper starts to investigate the advice complexity of this problem – the amount of oracle information an online algorithm needs in order to make optimal choices. We also consider a more general problem – a trade-off between online and offline graph coloring. In the paper we prove that precisely ⌈ n /2 ⌉ − 1 bits of advice are needed when the vertices on a path are presented for coloring in arbitrary order. The same holds in the more general case when just a subset of the vertices is colored online. However, the problem turns out to be non-trivial for the case where the online algorithm is guaranteed that the vertices it receives form a subset of a path and are presented in the order in which they lie on the path. For this variant we prove that its advice complexity is βn  +  O (log n ) bits, where β  ≈ 0.406 is a fixed constant (we give its closed form). This suggests that the generalized problem will be challenging for more complex graph classes.
