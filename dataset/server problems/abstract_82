In the weighted k -taxi problem, the cost of every taxi on the same distance is different whereas that is same in the traditional k -taxi problem. In this paper, the formulation of the on-line weighted k -taxi problem is presented first. Following that, some preliminary results which used to get the main theorems are given. Thirdly, some on-line algorithms are designed to address the problem and the competitive analysis are given in detail. Furthermore, the lower bound of competitive ratio for some special cases is obtained. Finally, some conclusions are made and some future research directions are pointed out.
