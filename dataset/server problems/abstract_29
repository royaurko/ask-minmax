Volume 6198 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 287-298 Metrical Task Systems and the k -Server Problem on HSTs Nikhil Bansal Affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University IBM T. J. Watson Research Center , Niv Buchbinder Affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University Microsoft Research , Joseph (Seffi) Naor Affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Dept., Technion We consider the randomized k -server problem, and give improved results for various metric spaces. In particular, we extend a recent result of Coté et al [15] for well-separated binary Hierarchically Separated Trees (HSTs) to well-separated d -ary HSTs for poly-logarithmic values of d . One application of this result is an \({\rm exp}(O(\sqrt{\log \log k \log n}))\) -competitive algorithm for k -server on n uniformly spaced points on a line. This substantially improves upon the prior guarantee of O ( min ( k , n 2/3 ) for this metric [16]. These results are based on obtaining a refined guarantee for the unfair metrical task systems problem on an HST. Prior to our work, such a guarantee was only known for the case of a uniform metric [5,7,18]. Our results are based on the primal-dual approach for online algorithms. Previous primal-dual approaches in the context of k-server and MTS [2,4,3] worked only for uniform or weighted star metrics, and the main technical contribution here is to extend many of these techniques to work directly on HSTs.
