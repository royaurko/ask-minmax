We study the classical multi-server queue and establish finite geometric moments and φ moments of the cycle variables: here where n is integer and φ 0 is concave. More generally, we consider systems with different initial conditions and prove moment and stochastic domination results for the delay variables. This together with the general results of [3] yields ergodic results for the time and customer dependent processes.
