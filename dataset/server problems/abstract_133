Volume 2161 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 86-97 Date: 17 August 2001 A General Decomposition Theorem for the k -Server Problem Steven S. Seiden Affiliated with Department of Computer Science 298 Coates Hall, Louisiana State University The first general decomposition theorem for the k -server problem is presented. Whereas all previous theorems are for the case of a finite metric with k + 1 points, the theorem given here allows an arbitrary number of points in the underlying metric space. This theorem implies O (polylog( k ))-competitive randomized algorithms for certain metric spaces consisting of a polylogarithmic number of widely separated sub-spaces, and takes a first step towards a general O (polylog( k ))-competitive algorithm. The only other cases for which polylogarithmic competitive randomized algorithms are known are the uniform metric space, and the weighted cache metric space with two weights. This research was partially supported by an LSU Council on Research summer stipend and by the Research Competitiveness Subprogram of the Louisiana Board of Regents.
