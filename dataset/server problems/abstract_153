Volume 6923 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 374-384 Guaranteeing Quality of Service in Globally Distributed Web System with Brokers KrzysztofÂ Zatwarnicki Affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University Department of Electrical, Control and Computer Engineering, Opole University of Technology A significant development of Web technologies requires the application of more and more complex methods for maintaining high quality of Web services. This paper presents the application of fuzzy logic and neural networks to HTTP request dispatching performed within a geographically distributed Web system to guarantee quality of service. The proposition of a broker-based system architecture with a global request dispatching method called GGARDiB (Guaranteed Globally Adaptive Request Distribution with Broker) is presented. The method guarantees quality of the Web service on given level, in such way that the page response times do not exceed established time. We demonstrate through the simulations that our algorithm is more effective than popular and reference global dispatching policies.
