The wait in a GI / M / k queue is bounded above (stochastically) by the wait in an associated GI / M /1 queue. The analysis of the single server queue is considerably easier than that of the k -server queue, and also the bounds developed for single server queues by J. F. C. Kingman and Kneale T. Marshall can be applied.
