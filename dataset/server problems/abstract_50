  HARMONIC is a randomized k -server algorithm that chooses the servers with probabilities proportional to the inverses of distances to the request point. We present a simple proof that HARMONIC is 3-competitive for k=2 . Keywords Analysis of algorithms ; Theory of computation ; Online algorithms ; Randomization 1 Y. Bartal, E.
