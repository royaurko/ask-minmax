Summary form only given. In mobile distributed systems, vital resources like battery power and wireless channel bandwidth impose significant challenges in ubiquitous information access. We propose a novel energy and bandwidth efficient data caching mechanism, called greedydual least utility (GD-LU), that enhances dynamic data availability while maintaining consistency. The proposed utility-based caching mechanism considers several characteristics of mobile distributed systems, such as connection-disconnection, mobility handoff, data update and user request patterns to achieve significant energy savings in mobile devices. Based on the utility function derived from an analytical model, we propose a cache replacement algorithm and a passive prefetching algorithm to cache and prefetch data objects. Our comprehensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves more than 10% energy saving and near-optimal performance tradeoff between access latency and energy consumption.
