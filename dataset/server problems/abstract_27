Volume 1770 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 605-613 Date: 24 March 2000 On the Competitive Ratio of the Work Function Algorithm for the k -Server Problem Yair Bartal Affiliated with Bell Labs , Elias Koutsoupias Affiliated with Univ of California The k -server problem is one of the most fundamental on-line problems. The problem is to schedule k mobile servers to serve a sequence of service points in a metric space to mimize the total mileage. The k -server conjecture [ 11 ] that states that there exists an optimal k -competitive on-line algorithm has been open for over 10 years. The top candidate on-line algorithm for settling this conjecture is the Work Function Algorithm ( WFA ) which was recently shown [ 7 , 9 ] to have competitive ratio at most 2 k −1. In this paper we lend support to the conjecture that wfa is in fact k -competitive by proving that it achieves this ratio in several special metric spaces. Supported in part by NSF grant CCR-9521606
