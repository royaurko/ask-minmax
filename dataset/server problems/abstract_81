  We present a lower bound of on the competitive ratio of randomized algorithms for the weighted 2-cache problem, which is a special case of the 2-server problem. This improves the previously best known lower bound of for both problems. Keywords Online algorithms ; Randomized algorithms ; Competitive analysis [1] D. Achlioptas, M. Chrobak and J.
