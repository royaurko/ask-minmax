  We consider problems involving robot motion planning in an initially unknown scene of obstacles. The two specific problems that we examine are mapping the scene and searching the scene for a recognizable target whose location is unknown. We use competitive analysis as a tool for comparing algorithms. In the case of convex polygonal obstacles, we show a tight Θ(min( k , √ k )) bound on the competitive factor for these problems, where and k are the average aspect ratio and the number of objects, respectively. We also consider the competitive factor for the Nearest Neighbor heuristic. [1] R. Baeza-Yates, J. Culberson and G. Rawlins, Searching in the plane, Inform. Comput, to appear. [2] A. Blum, P.
