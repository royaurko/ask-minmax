The advent of the Web service brought out the explosive growth of Internet, which necessitates a scheme to reduce the network traffic. Caching is a popular method in reducing such traffic, and it is widely used in many Web servers, clients, and proxy servers. Since an object of Web service is accessed as a whole, the caching scheme for such object must be different from others that usually treat a piece of an object as a unit of caching. In this paper, we propose caching schemes for variable size objects. Performance of the proposed schemes are explored through trace-driven simulation studies
