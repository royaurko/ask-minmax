  The k -server problem is one of the most fundamental online problems. The problem is to schedule k mobile servers to visit a sequence of points in a metric space with minimum total mileage. The k -server conjecture of Manasse, McGeogh, and Sleator states that there exists a k -competitive online algorithm. The conjecture has been open for over 15 years. The top candidate online algorithm for settling this conjecture is the work function algorithm ( WFA ) which was shown to have competitive ratio at most 2 k −1. In this paper, we lend support to the conjecture that WFA is in fact k -competitive by proving that it achieves this ratio in several special metric spaces: the line, the star, and all metric spaces with k +2 points.
