This paper is the journal version of “On-line Caching as Cache Size Varies,” which appeared in the Proceedings of the 2nd Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (1991). Details beyond those in this paper may be found in “Competitive Paging and Dual-Guided Algorithms for Weighted Caching and Matching,” which is the author's thesis and is available as Technical Report CS-TR-348-91 from the Computer Science Department at Princeton University.
