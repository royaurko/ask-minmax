Volume 5893 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 128-134 On the Additive Constant of the k -Server Work Function Algorithm Yuval Emek Affiliated with Lancaster University Tel Aviv University , Pierre Fraigniaud Affiliated with Lancaster University CNRS and University Paris Diderot , Amos Korman Affiliated with Lancaster University CNRS and University Paris Diderot , Adi Rosén Affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University CNRS and University of Paris 11 We consider the Work Function Algorithm for the k -server problem [2,4]. We show that if the Work Function Algorithm is c -competitive, then it is also strictly (2 c )-competitive. As a consequence of [4] this also shows that the Work Function Algorithm is strictly (4 k  − 2)-competitive.
