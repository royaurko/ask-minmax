Volume 8179 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 55-67 On Advice Complexity of the k -server Problem under Sparse Metrics Sushmita Gupta Affiliated with Lancaster University University of Southern Denmark , Shahin Kamali Affiliated with Lancaster University Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo , Alejandro López-Ortiz Affiliated with Lancaster University Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo We consider the k- Server problem under the advice model of computation when the underlying metric space is sparse. On one side, we introduce Θ(1)-competitive algorithms for a wide range of sparse graphs, which require advice of (almost) linear size. Namely, we show that for graphs of size N and treewidth α , there is an online algorithm which receives O ( n (log α  + log log N )) bits of advice and optimally serves a sequence of length n . With a different argument, we show that if a graph admits a system of μ collective tree ( q , r )- spanners, then there is a ( q  +  r )-competitive algorithm which receives O ( n (log μ  + log log N )) bits of advice. Among other results, this gives a 3-competitive algorithm for planar graphs, provided with O ( n log log N ) bits of advice. On the other side, we show that an advice of size Ω( n ) is required to obtain a 1-competitive algorithm for sequences of size n even for the 2-server problem on a path metric of size N  ≥ 5. Through another lower bound argument, we show that at least \(\frac{n}{2}({\rm log} \alpha- 1.22)\) bits of advice is required to obtain an optimal solution for metric spaces of treewidth α , where 4 ≤  α  < 2 k .
