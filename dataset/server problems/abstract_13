Â  The k k -server problem is perhaps the most influential online problem: natural, crisp, with a surprising technical depth that manifests the richness of competitive analysis. The k k -server conjecture, which was posed more than two decades ago when the problem was first studied within the competitive analysis framework, is still open and has been a major driving force for the development of the area online algorithms. This article surveys some major results for the k k -server problem. 1. Introduction The k k -server problem in a metric space (or weighted graph) is the problem of efficiently moving around k k servers to service requests that appear online at the points of the metric space. The k k servers start at a fixed set of k k points which we call the initial configuration. Then in each time step a request appears at some point of the metric space and some server has to move to that point to service the request. We assume that the requests appear sequentially and that a new request appears only after the current request has been serviced. The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by the servers. More formally, the definition of the problem is as follows: Let M M be a metric space and let d(a 1 ,a 2 ) d ( a 1 , a 2 ) denote the distance in M M of points a 1 a 1 and a 2 a 2 . The distance d d is nonnegative, symmetric, and satisfies the triangle inequality. For simplicity, we allow distinct points to be at distance 0, or more formally, M M is pseudometric rather than metric. Special spaces such as the uniform metric space (with all distances equal), the line (or Euclidean 1-dimensional metric space) and tree metric spaces are of particular interest for the k k -server problem.
