Journal of Applied Probability Description: Journal of Applied Probability and Advances in Applied Probability have for four decades provided a forum for original research and reviews in applied probability, mapping the development of probability theory and its applications to physical, biological, medical, social and technological problems. Their wide readership includes leading researchers in the many fields in which stochastic models are used, including operations research, telecommunications, computer engineering, epidemiology, financial mathematics, information systems and traffic management. Advances includes a section dedicated to stochastic geometry and its statistical applications. Coverage: 1964-2011 (Vol. 1, No. 1 - Vol. 48, No. 4) Moving Wall The "moving wall" represents the time period between the last issue available in JSTOR and the most recently published issue of a journal. Moving walls are generally represented in years. In rare instances, a publisher has elected to have a "zero" moving wall, so their current issues are available in JSTOR shortly after publication. Note: In calculating the moving wall, the current year is not counted. For example, if the current year is 2008 and a journal has a 5 year moving wall, articles from the year 2002 are available. Terms Related to the Moving Wall Fixed walls: Journals with no new volumes being added to the archive. Absorbed: Journals that are combined with another title. Complete: Journals that are no longer published or that have been combined with another title. Subjects: Science & Mathematics, Statistics
