In this paper we introduce a novel method for fabricating MgB$_2$/MgO
multilayers and demonstrate the potential for using them as a new model for
disordered superconductors. In this approach we control the annealing of the
MgB$_2$ to yield an interesting new class of disordered (amorphous)
superconductors with relatively high transition temperatures. The multilayers
appear to exhibit quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity with controlled
anisotropy. We discuss the properties of the multilayers as the thickness of
the components of the bilayers vary.
