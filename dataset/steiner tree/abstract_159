We investigate the interaction of magneto-acoustic waves with magnetic
network elements with the aim of finding possible signatures of the magnetic
shadow phenomenon in the vicinity of network elements. We carried out
three-dimensional numerical simulations of magneto-acoustic wave propagation in
a model solar atmosphere that is threaded by a complexly structured magnetic
field, resembling that of a typical magnetic network element and of
internetwork regions. High-frequency waves of 10 mHz are excited at the bottom
of the simulation domain. On their way through the upper convection zone and
through the photosphere and the chromosphere they become perturbed, refracted,
and converted into different mode types. We applied a standard Fourier analysis
to produce oscillatory power-maps of the line-of-sight velocity. In the power
maps of the upper photosphere and the lower chromosphere, we clearly see the
magnetic shadow: a seam of suppressed power surrounding the magnetic network
elements. We demonstrate that this shadow is linked to the mode conversion
process and that power maps at these height levels show the signature of three
different magneto-acoustic wave modes.
