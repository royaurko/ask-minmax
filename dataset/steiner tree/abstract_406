Our object is a thorough analysis of the WP-Bailey tree, a recent extension
of classical Bailey chains. We begin by observing how the WP-Bailey tree
naturally entails a finite number of classical q-hypergeometric transformation
formulas. We then show how to move beyond this closed set of results and in the
process we explicate heretofore mysterious identities of D. Bressoud. Next, we
use WP-Bailey pairs to provide a new proof of recent formula of A. Kirillov.
Finally, we discuss the relation between our approach and that of W. Burge.
