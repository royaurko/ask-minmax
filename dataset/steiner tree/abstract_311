Nuclear reactions induced by stable and/or radioactive neutron-rich nuclei
provide the opportunity to pin down the equation of state of neutron-rich
matter, especially the density ($\rho$) dependence of its isospin-dependent
part, i.e., the nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm sym}$. A conservative
constraint, $32(\rho /\rho_{0})^{0.7} < E_{\rm sym}(\rho ) < 32(\rho /\rho
_{0})^{1.1}$, around the nuclear matter saturation density $\rho_0$ has
recently been obtained from the isospin diffusion data in intermediate energy
heavy-ion collisions. We review this exciting result and discuss its
consequences and implications on nuclear effective interactions, radii and
cooling mechanisms of neutron stars.
