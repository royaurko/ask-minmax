We report the radio-frequency performance of carbon nanotube array
transistors that have been realized through the aligned assembly of highly
separated, semiconducting carbon nanotubes on a fully scalable device platform.
At a gate length of 100 nm, we observe output current saturation and obtain
as-measured, extrinsic current gain and power gain cut-off frequencies,
respectively, of 7 GHz and 15 GHz. While the extrinsic current gain is
comparable to the state-of-the-art the extrinsic power gain is improved. The
de-embedded, intrinsic current gain and power gain cut-off frequencies of 153
GHz and 30 GHz are the highest values experimentally achieved to date. We
analyze the consistency of DC and AC performance parameters and discuss the
requirements for future applications of carbon nanotube array transistors in
high-frequency electronics.
