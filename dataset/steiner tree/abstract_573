The Daya Bay reactor antineutrino experiment is designed to make a precision
measurement of the neutrino mixing angle theta13, and recently made the
definitive discovery of its nonzero value. It utilizes a set of eight,
functionally identical antineutrino detectors to measure the reactor flux and
spectrum at baselines of 300 - 2000m from the Daya Bay and Ling Ao Nuclear
Power Plants. The Daya Bay antineutrino detectors were built in an above-ground
facility and deployed side-by-side at three underground experimental sites near
and far from the nuclear reactors. This configuration allows the experiment to
make a precision measurement of reactor antineutrino disappearance over km-long
baselines and reduces relative systematic uncertainties between detectors and
nuclear reactors. This paper describes the assembly and installation of the
Daya Bay antineutrino detectors.
