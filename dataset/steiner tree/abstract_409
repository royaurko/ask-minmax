We prove some general results about quasi-actions on trees and define
Property (QFA), which is analogous to Serre's Property (FA), but in the coarse
setting. This property is shown to hold for a class of groups, including
$SL(n,\Z)$ for $n\geq 3$. We also give a way of thinking about Property (QFA)
by breaking it down into statements about particular classes of trees.
