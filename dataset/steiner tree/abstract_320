We present 2D local box simulations of near-surface radiative
magneto-convection with prescribed magnetic flux, carried out with the MHD
version of the CO5BOLD code for the Sun and a solar-like star with a metal-poor
chemical composition (metal abundances reduced by a factor 100, [M/H]=-2). The
resulting magneto-hydrodynamical models can be used to study the influence of
the metallicity on the properties of magnetized stellar atmospheres. A
preliminary analysis indicates that the horizontal magnetic field component
tends to be significantly stronger in the optically thin layers of metal-poor
stellar atmospheres.
