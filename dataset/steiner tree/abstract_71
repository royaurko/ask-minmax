Ambartzumian et.al. suggested that the modified Steiner action functional had
desirable properties for a random surface action. However, Durhuus and Jonsson
pointed out that such an action led to an ill-defined grand-canonical partition
function and suggested that the addition of an area term might improve matters.
In this paper we investigate this and other related actions numerically for
dynamically triangulated random surfaces and compare the results with the
gaussian plus extrinsic curvature actions that have been used previously.
