In this paper we show that on bounded degree graphs and general trees, the
cover time of the simple random walk is asymptotically equal to the product of
the number of edges and the square of the expected supremum of the Gaussian
free field on the graph, assuming that the maximal hitting time is
significantly smaller than the cover time. Previously, this was only proved for
regular trees and the 2D lattice. Furthermore, for general trees, we derive
exponential concentration for the cover time, which implies that the standard
deviation of the cover time is bounded by the geometric mean of the cover time
and the maximal hitting time.
