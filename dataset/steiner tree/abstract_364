In this note we present a simplified and slightly generalized version of a
lemma the contributors published in 1987. The lemma as stated here asserts that if
the order of a permutation of $n$ elements is greater than $n^{\alpha}$ then
some non-identity power of the permutation has support size less than
$n/{\alpha}$. The original version made an unnecessary additional assumption on
the cycle structure of the permutation; the proof of the present cleaner
version follows the original proof verbatim. Application areas include parallel
and sequential algorithms for permutation groups, the diameter of Cayley graphs
of permutation groups, and the automorphisms of structures with regularity
constraints such as Latin squares, Steiner 2-designs, and strongly regular
graphs. This note also serves as a modest tribute to the junior contributor whose
untimely passing is deeply mourned.
