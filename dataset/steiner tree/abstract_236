Time-resolved spectroscopy of the novalike variable UU Aquarii is analyzed
with eclipse mapping techniques to produce spatially resolved spectra of its
accretion disc and gas stream as a function of distance from disc centre in the
range 3600-6900 \AA. The spatially-resolved spectra show that the continuum
emission becomes progressively fainter and redder for increasing disc radius --
reflecting the radial temperature gradient -- and reveal that the HI and HeI
lines appear as deep, narrow absorption features in the inner disc regions
transitioning to emission with P Cygni profiles for intermediate and large disc
radii. The spectrum of the uneclipsed component has strong HI and HeI emission
lines plus a Balmer jump in emission and is explained as optically thin
emission from a vertically extended disc chromosphere + wind. Most of the line
emission probably arises from the wind. The spatially-resolved spectra also
suggest the existence of gas stream ``disk-skimming'' overflow in UU Aqr, which
can be seen down to R \simeq 0.2 R_{L1}. The comparison of our eclipse maps
with those of Baptista, Steiner & Horne (1996) suggests that the asymmetric
structure in the outer disc previously identified as the bright spot may be the
signature of an elliptical disc similar to those possibly present in SU UMa
stars during superoutbursts.
