We solve the long-standing open problem of classifying all 3-(v,k,1) designs
with a flag-transitive group of automorphisms (cf. A. Delandtsheer, Geom.
Dedicata 41 (1992), p. 147; and in: "Handbook of Incidence Geometry", ed. by F.
Buekenhout, Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, 1995, p. 273; but presumably dating
back to 1965). Our result relies on the classification of the finite
2-transitive permutation groups.
