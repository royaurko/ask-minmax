Three kinds of magnetic couplings in the quiet solar atmosphere are
highlighted and discussed, all fundamentally connected to the Lorentz force.
First the coupling of the convecting and overshooting fluid in the surface
layers of the Sun with the magnetic field. Here, the plasma motion provides the
dominant force, which shapes the magnetic field and drives the surface dynamo.
Progress in the understanding of the horizontal magnetic field is summarized
and discussed. Second, the coupling between acoustic waves and the magnetic
field, in particular the phenomenon of wave conversion and wave refraction. It
is described how measurements of wave travel times in the atmosphere can
provide information about the topography of the wave conversion zone, i.e., the
surface of equal Alfv\'en and sound speed. In quiet regions, this surface
separates a highly dynamic magnetic field with fast moving magnetosonic waves
and shocks around and above it from the more slowly evolving field of high-beta
plasma below it. Third, the magnetic field also couples to the radiation field,
which leads to radiative flux channeling and increased anisotropy in the
radiation field. It is shown how faculae can be understood in terms of this
effect. The article starts with an introduction to the magnetic field of the
quiet Sun in the light of new results from the Hinode space observatory and
with a brief survey of measurements of the turbulent magnetic field with the
help of the Hanle effect.
