In this second paper of a series, we present a treatment procedure for data
cubes obtained with the Spectrograph for Integral Field Observations in the
Near Infrared of the Very Large Telescope. We verified that the treatment
procedure improves significantly the quality of the images of the data cubes,
allowing a more detailed analysis. The images of the Br$\gamma$ and H$_2
\lambda 21218$ emission lines from the treated data cube of the nuclear region
of NGC 5643 reveal the existence of ionized and molecular-gas clouds around the
nucleus, which cannot be seen clearly in the images from the non-treated data
cube of this galaxy. The ionized-gas clouds represent the narrow-line region,
in the form of a bicone. We observe a good correspondence between the positions
of the ionized-gas clouds in the Br$\gamma$ image and in an [O III] image,
obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, of the nuclear region of this galaxy
convolved with an estimate of the point-spread function of the data cube of NGC
5643. The morphologies of the ionized and molecular gas seem to be compatible
with the existence of a molecular torus/disc that collimates the active
galactic nucleus (AGN) emission. The molecular gas may also flow along this
torus/disc, feeding the AGN. This scenario is compatible with the unified model
for AGNs.
