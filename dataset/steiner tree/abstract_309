In an effort to understand the implications of Coulomb dissociation
experiments for the determination of the 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction rate,
longitudinal momentum distributions of 7Be fragments produced in the Coulomb
dissociation of 44 and 81 MeV/nucleon 8B beams on a Pb target were measured.
These distributions are characterized by asymmetries interpreted as the result
of interference between E1 and E2 transition amplitudes in the Coulomb breakup.
At the lower beam energy, both the asymmetries and the measured cross sections
are well reproduced by perturbation theory calculations, allowing a
determination of the E2 strength.
