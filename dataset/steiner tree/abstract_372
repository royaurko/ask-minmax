A protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) code design technique for
bandwidth-efficient coded modulation is presented. The approach jointly
optimizes the LDPC code node degrees and the mapping of the coded bits to the
bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) bit-channels. For BICM with uniform
input and for BICM with probabilistic shaping, binary-input symmetric-output
surrogate channels are constructed and used for code design. The constructed
codes perform as good as multi-edge type codes of Zhang and Kschischang (2013).
For 64-ASK with probabilistic shaping, a blocklength 64800 code is constructed
that operates within 0.69 dB of 0.5log(1+SNR) at a spectral efficiency of 4.2
bits/channel use and a frame error rate of 1e-3.
