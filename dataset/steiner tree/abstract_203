We let (M^m, g) be a closed smooth Riemannian manifold (m >1) with positive
scalar curvature S_g, and prove that the Yamabe constant of (M \times
R^n,g+g_E) is achieved by a metric in the conformal class of (g+g_E), where g_E
is the Euclidean metric. We also show that the Yamabe quotient of (M \times
R^n,g+g_E) is improved by Steiner symmetrization with respect to M. It follows
from this last assertion that the dependence on R^n of the Yamabe minimizer of
(M \times R^n,g+g_E) is radial.
