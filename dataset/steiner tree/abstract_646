Le Roux and Ziegler asked whether every simply connected compact nonempty
planar co-c.e. closed set always contains a computable point. In this paper, we
solve the problem of le Roux and Ziegler by showing that there exists a
contractible planar co-c.e. dendroid without computable points. We also provide
several pathological examples of tree-like co-c.e. continua fulfilling certain
global incomputability properties: there is a computable dendrite which does
not *-include a co-c.e. tree; there is a co-c.e. dendrite which does not
*-include a computable dendrite; there is a computable dendroid which does not
*-include a co-c.e. dendrite. Here, a continuum A *-includes a member of a
class P of continua if, for every positive real, A includes a P-continuum B
such that the Hausdorff distance between A and B is smaller than the real.
