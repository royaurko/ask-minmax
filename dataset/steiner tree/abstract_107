Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. A Steiner convex partition
is a tiling of ${\rm conv}(S)$ with empty convex bodies. For every integer $d$,
we show that $S$ admits a Steiner convex partition with at most $\lceil
(n-1)/d\rceil$ tiles. This bound is the best possible for points in general
position in the plane, and it is best possible apart from constant factors in
every fixed dimension $d\geq 3$. We also give the first constant-factor
approximation algorithm for computing a minimum Steiner convex partition of a
planar point set in general position. Establishing a tight lower bound for the
maximum volume of a tile in a Steiner convex partition of any $n$ points in the
unit cube is equivalent to a famous problem of Danzer and Rogers. It is
conjectured that the volume of the largest tile is $\omega(1/n)$.
  Here we give a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for computing the
maximum volume of an empty convex body amidst $n$ given points in the
$d$-dimensional unit box $[0,1]^d$.
