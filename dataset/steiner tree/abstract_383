An equiangular tight frame (ETF) is a set of unit vectors whose coherence
achieves the Welch bound, and so is as incoherent as possible. Though they
arise in many applications, only a few methods for constructing them are known.
Motivated by the connection between real ETFs and graph theory, we introduce
the notion of ETFs that are symmetric about their centroid. We then discuss how
well-known constructions, such as harmonic ETFs and Steiner ETFs, can have
centroidal symmetry. Finally, we establish a new equivalence between
centroid-symmetric real ETFs and certain types of strongly regular graphs
(SRGs). Together, these results give the first proof of the existence of
certain SRGs, as well as the disproofs of the existence of others.
