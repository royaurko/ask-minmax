Among the properties of homogeneity of incidence structures flag-transitivity
obviously is a particularly important and natural one. Consequently, in the
last decades also flag-transitive Steiner tdesigns (i.e. flag-transitive
t-(v,k,1) designs) have been investigated, whereas only by the use of the
classification of the finite simple groups has it been possible in recent years
to essentially characterize all flag-transitive Steiner 2-designs. However,
despite the finite simple group classification, for Steiner t-designs with
parameters t > 2 such characterizations have remained challenging open problems
for about 40 years (cf. [11, p. 147] and [12, p. 273], but presumably dating
back to around 1965). The object of the present paper is to give a complete
classification of all flag-transitive Steiner 4-designs. Our result relies on
the classification of the finite doubly transitive permutation groups and is a
continuation of the contributor's work [20, 21] on the classification of all
flag-transitive Steiner 3-designs.
