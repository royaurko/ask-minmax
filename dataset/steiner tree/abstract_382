Conjugated polymers offer potential for many diverse applications but we
still lack a fundamental microscopic understanding of their electronic
structure. Elementary photoexcitations - excitons - span only a few nanometres
of a molecule, which itself can extend over microns, and how their behaviour is
affected by molecular dimensions is not fully understood. For example, where is
the exciton formed within a conjugated segment, is it always situated on the
same repeat units? Here, we introduce structurally-rigid molecular spoked
wheels, 6 nanometres in diameter, as a model of extended pi-conjugation.
Single-molecule fluorescence reveals random exciton localisation, leading to
temporally-varying emission polarisation. Initially, this random localisation
arises after every photon absorption event because of temperature independent
spontaneous symmetry breaking. These fast fluctuations are slowed to
millisecond timescales following prolonged illumination. Intramolecular
heterogeneity is revealed in cryogenic spectroscopy by jumps in transition
energy, however, emission polarisation can also switch without a spectral jump
occurring, implying long-range homogeneity in local dielectric environment.
