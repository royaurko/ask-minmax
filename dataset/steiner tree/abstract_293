The fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are investigated
for a hyperbolic universe with finite volume. Four-component models with
radiation, matter, vacuum energy, and an extra spatially constant dark energy
X-component are considered. The general solution of the Friedmann equation for
the cosmic scale factor a(eta) is given for the four-component models in terms
of the Weierstrass P-function. The lower part of the angular power spectra C_l
of the CMB anisotropy is computed for nearly flat models with Omega_tot <=
0.95. It is shown that the particular compact fundamental cell, which is
considered in this paper, leads to a suppression in C_l for l<10 and Omega_tot
<= 0.9.
