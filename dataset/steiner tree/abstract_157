This is the second in a two part series of papers on incorporation of the
broadcast approach into oblivious protocols for the relay channel where the
source and the relay are collocated. Part I described the broadcast approach
and its benefits in terms of achievable rates when used with the sequential
decode- and-forward (SDF) scheme. Part II investigates yet another oblivious
scheme, the Block-Markov decode- and-forward (BMDF) under the single and
two-layered transmissions. For the single layer, previously reported results
are enhanced and a conjecture regarding the optimal correlation coefficient
between the source and the relay's transmission is established. For the
discrete multi-layer transmission of two or more layers, it is shown that
perfect cooperation (2x1 MISO) rates are attained even with low collocation
gains at the expense of a longer delay, improving upon those achievable by the
SDF.
