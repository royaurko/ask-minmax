Is it possible to color the naturals with finitely many colors so that no
Pythagorean triple is monochromatic? This question is even open for two colors.
A natural strategy is to show that some small nonbipartite triple systems
cannot be realized as a family of Pythagorean triples. It suffices to consider
partial triple systems (PTS's), and it is therefore natural to consider the
Fano plane, the smallest nonbipartite PTS. We show that the Pythagorean triples
do not contain any Fano plane. In fact, our main result is that a much larger
family of "ordered" triple systems (viz. those with a certain "sum property")
do not contain any Steiner triple system (STS).
