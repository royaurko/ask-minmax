The mixed phase of quarks and hadrons which might exist in the dense matter
encountered in the varying conditions of temperature and trapped neutrino
fraction in proto-neutron stars is studied. The extent that the mixed phase
depends upon the thermodynamical parameters as well as on the stiffness of
matter in the hadronic and quark phases is discussed. We show that hadronic
equations of state that maximize the quark content of matter at a given {\it
density} generally minimize the extent of the mixed phase region in a neutron
star of a given mass, and that only in extreme cases could a pure quark star
result. For both the Nambu Jona-Lasinio and MIT bag quark models, neutrino
trapping inhibits the appearance of a mixed phase which leads to possible
proto-neutron star metastability. The main difference between the two quark
models is the small abundance of strange quarks in the former. We also
demonstrate that $\partial T/\partial n<0$ along adiabats in the quark-hadron
mixed phase, opposite to what is found for the kaon condensates-hadron mixed
phase. This could lead to core temperatures which are significantly lower in
stars containing quarks than in those not containing quarks.
