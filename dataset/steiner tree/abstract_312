Every entangled state can be perturbed, for instance by decoherence, and stay
entangled. For a large class of pure entangled states, we show how large the
perturbation can be. Our class includes all pure bipartite and all maximally
entangled states. For an entangled state, E, the constucted neighborhood of
entangled states is the region outside two parallel hyperplanes, which sandwich
the set of all separable states. The states for which these neighborhoods are
largest are the maximally entangled ones. As the number of particles, or the
dimensions of the Hilbert spaces for two of the particles increases, the
distance between two of the hyperplanes which sandwich the separable states
goes to zero. It is easy to decide if a state Q is in the neighborhood of
entangled states we construct for an entangled state E. One merely has to check
if the trace of EQ is greater than a constant which depends upon E and which we
determine.
