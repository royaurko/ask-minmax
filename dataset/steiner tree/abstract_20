A data structure is presented for point location in connected planar
subdivisions when the distribution of queries is known in advance. The data
structure has an expected query time that is within a constant factor of
optimal. More specifically, an algorithm is presented that preprocesses a
connected planar subdivision G of size n and a query distribution D to produce
a point location data structure for G. The expected number of point-line
comparisons performed by this data structure, when the queries are distributed
according to D, is H + O(H^{2/3}+1) where H=H(G,D) is a lower bound on the
expected number of point-line comparisons performed by any linear decision tree
for point location in G under the query distribution D. The preprocessing
algorithm runs in O(n log n) time and produces a data structure of size O(n).
These results are obtained by creating a Steiner triangulation of G that has
near-minimum entropy.
