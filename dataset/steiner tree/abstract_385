We analyze the latent heat and surface tension at the SU(3) deconfinement
phase transition with tree level and tadpole improved Symanzik actions on
lattices with temporal extent $N_\tau = 3$ and 4 and spatial extent $N_\sigma/
N_\tau = 4$, 6 and 8. In comparison to the standard Wilson action we do find a
drastic reduction of cut-off effects already with tree level improved actions.
On lattices with temporal extent $N_\tau=4$ results for the surface tension and
latent heat obtained with a tree level improved action agree well with those
obtained with a tadpole improved action. A comparison with $N_\tau=3$
calculations, however, shows that results obtained with tadpole action remain
unaffected by cut-off effects even on this coarse lattice, while the tree level
action becomes sensitive to the cut-off. For the surface tension and latent
heat we find $\sigma_I/ T_c^3 = 0.0155~(16)$ and $\Delta\epsilon/T_c^4 =
1.40~(9)$, respectively.
