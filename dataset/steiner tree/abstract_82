In order to establish which parameters and corresponding weights are more
appropriate for the assessment of academic excellence in the context of
university rankings, I have made a multivariate data analysis on a set of 13
parameters for 178 institutions. I found that the three more relevant
components are academic excellence (48%), internationalism (14%) and
faculty/student ratio (8%). It is shown that these components are not
correlated.
