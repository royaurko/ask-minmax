Black phosphorus is a layered semiconductor that is intensely researched in
view of applications in optoelectronics. In this Letter, we investigate a
multi-layer black phosphorus photo-detector that is capable of acquiring
high-contrast (V>0.9) images both in the visible ({\lambda}_{VIS}=532nm) as
well as in the infrared ({\lambda}_{IR}=1550nm) spectral regime. In a first
step, by using photocurrent microscopy, we map the active area of the device
and we characterize responsivity and gain. In a second step, by deploying the
black phosphorus device as a point-like detector in a confocal microsope setup,
we acquire diffraction-limited optical images with sub-micron resolution. The
results demonstrate the usefulness of black phosphorus as an optoelectronic
material for hyperspectral imaging applications.
