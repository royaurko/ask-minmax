The mysteriously low CMB power on the largest scales might point to a
Universe which consists of a multi-connected space. In addition to a
suppression of large-scale power, a multi-connected space can be revealed by
its circles-in-the-sky signature. In this paper, a detailed search for this
signature is carried out for those three homogeneous multi-connected spherical
space forms that lead to the smallest large-scale power. A simultaneous search
for all occurring paired circles is made using filtered CMB sky maps which
enhance the ordinary Sachs-Wolfe contribution. A marginal hint is found for the
right-handed Poincare dodecahedron at Omega_tot = 1.015 and for the
right-handed binary tetrahedral space at Omega_tot = 1.068. However, due to the
complicated noise and foreground structure of the available microwave sky maps,
we cannot draw firm conclusions from our findings.
