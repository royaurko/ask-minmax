We analyze the molecular H$_2$ emission and the stellar kinematics in a data
cube of the nuclear region of M104, the Sombrero galaxy, obtained with NIFS on
the Gemini-north telescope. After a careful subtraction of the stellar
continuum, the only emission line we detected in the data cube was H$_2 \lambda
21218$. An analysis of this emission revealed the existence of a rotating
molecular torus/disk, aproximately co-planar with a dusty structure detected by
us in a previous work. We interpret these two structures as being associated
with the same obscuring torus/disk. The kinematic maps provided by the
Penalized Pixel Fitting method revealed that the stellar kinematics in the
nuclear region of M104 appears to be the result of the superposition of a
"cold" rotating disk and a "hot" bulge. Using a model of a thin eccentric disk,
we reproduced the main properties of the maps of the stellar radial velocity
and of the stellar velocity dispersion, specially within a distance of 0.2"
from the kinematic axis (in regions at larger distances, the limitations of a
model of a thin rotating disk become more visible). The general behavior of the
$h_3$ map, which is significantly noisier than the other maps, was also
reproduced by our model (although the discrepancies, in this case, are
considerably higher). With our model, we obtained a mass of (9.0 +/- 2.0) x
10^8 Mo for the supermassive black hole of M104, which is compatible, at
$1\sigma$ or $2\sigma$ levels, with the values obtained by previous studies.
