HD 45166 was selected as a candidate to the V Sagittae Class. It's spectrum
shows quite narrow emission lines of He, C, N, and O, possibly indicating a low
inclination for the binary system. We performed high resolution and high
stability Coude spectroscopy in order to search for low amplitude radial
velocity variations. The orbital period determined from the radial velocity
curve is 0.357 days, and the radial velocity semi amplitude is K=3.8 km/s. The
system inclination (in degrees), determined from the mass function of the
secondary star, is 0.7 < i < 1.0.
