The correlation between the thickness of the neutron skin in Pb-208, and the
degree of isospin diffusion in heavy-ion collisions is examined. The same
equation of state is used to compute the degree of isospin diffusion in an
isospin-depedent transport model and the neutron skin thickness in the
Hartree-Fock approximation. We find that skin thicknesses less than 0.15 fm are
excluded by the isospin diffusion data.
