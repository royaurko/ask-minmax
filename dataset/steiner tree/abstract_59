An algebraic process for the construction of an autotopism for a non-Steiner
C-loop is described and this is demonstrated with an example using a known
finite C-loop. In every C-loop, two of its parastrophes are not
equivalent(equal) it, if and only if both the first and second components of
the constructed autotopism and its inverse autotopism are not equal to the
identity map. Hence, none of the other three parastrophes is equivalent(equal)
to the C-loop. It is proved that the set of autotopisms that prevent a C-loop
from being a Steiner loop forms a Steiner triple system.
