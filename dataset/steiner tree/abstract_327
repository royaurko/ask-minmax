A series of sigma-phase Fe_{100-x}V_x samples with 34.4 < x < 59.0 were
investigated by neutron and X-ray diffraction and Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS)
techniques. The first two methods were used for verification of the
transformation from alpha to sigma phase and they also permitted to determine
lattice parameters of the unit cell. With MS the Debye temperature, T_D, was
evaluated from the temperature dependence of the centre shift, <CS>, assuming
its entire temperature dependence originates from the second-order Doppler
shift. To our best knowledge, it is the first ever-reported study on T_D in
sigma-FeV alloys. Both attice parameters i.e. a and c were revealed to linearly
increase with x. T_D shows, however, a non-monotonic behaviour as a function of
composition with its extreme values between 425K for x=40 and 600K for x=59. A
local maximum of 525K was found to exist at x=43.
