In the disproof of the Strong Simplex Conjecture presented in [Steiner,
1994], a counterexample signal set was found that has higher average
probability of correct optimal decoding than the corresponding regular simplex
signal set, when compared at small values of the signal-to-noise ratio. The
latter was defined as the quotient of average signal energy and average noise
power. In this paper, it is shown that this interpretation of the
signal-to-noise ratio is inappropriate for a comparison of signal sets, since
it leads to a contradiction with the Channel Coding Theorem. A modified
counterexample signal set is proposed and examined using the classical
interpretation of the signal-to-noise ratio, i.e., as the quotient of average
signal energy and average noise energy. This signal set outperforms the regular
simplex signal set for small signal-to-noise ratios without contradicting the
Channel Coding Theorem, hence the Strong Simplex Conjecture remains proven
false.
