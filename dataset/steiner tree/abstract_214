We perform laser spectroscopy of Yb+ ions on the 4f14 6s 2S_{1/2} - 4f13 5d
6s 3D[3/2]_{1/2} transition at 297 nm. The frequency measurements for 170Yb+,
172Yb+, 174Yb+, and 176Yb+ reveal the specific mass shift as well as the field
shifts. In addition, we demonstrate laser cooling of Yb+ ions using this
transition and show that light at 297 nm can be used as the second step in the
photoionization of neutral Yb atoms.
