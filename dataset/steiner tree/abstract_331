A smooth quartic curve in the complex projective plane has 36 inequivalent
representations as a symmetric determinant of linear forms and 63
representations as a sum of three squares. These correspond to Cayley octads
and Steiner complexes respectively. We present exact algorithms for computing
these objects from the 28 bitangents. This expresses Vinnikov quartics as
spectrahedra and positive quartics as Gram matrices. We explore the geometry of
Gram spectrahedra and we find equations for the variety of Cayley octads.
Interwoven is an exposition of much of the 19th century theory of plane
quartics.
