The Steiner distance of a graph, introduced by Chartrand, Oellermann, Tian
and Zou in 1989, is a natural generalization of the concept of classical graph
distance. For a connected graph $G$ of order at least $2$ and $S\subseteq
V(G)$, the \emph{Steiner distance} $d(S)$ among the vertices of $S$ is the
minimum size among all connected subgraphs whose vertex sets contain $S$. Let
$n,k$ be two integers with $2\leq k\leq n$. Then the \emph{Steiner
$k$-eccentricity $e_k(v)$} of a vertex $v$ of $G$ is defined by $e_k(v)=\max
\{d(S)\,|\,S\subseteq V(G), \ |S|=k, \ and \ v\in S \}$. Furthermore, the
\emph{Steiner $k$-diameter} of $G$ is $sdiam_k(G)=\max \{e_k(v)\,|\, v\in
V(G)\}$. In 2011, Chartrand, Okamoto and Zhang showed that $k-1\leq
sdiam_k(G)\leq n-1$. In this paper, graphs with $sdiam_3(G)=2,3,n-1$ are
characterized, respectively. We also consider the Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results
for the parameter $sdiam_3(G)$. We determine sharp upper and lower bounds of
$sdiam_3(G)+sdiam_3(\overline{G})$ and $sdiam_3(G)\cdot sdiam_3(\overline{G})$
for a graph $G$ of order $n$. Some graph classes attaining these bounds are
also given.
