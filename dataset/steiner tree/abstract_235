Let T be the category whose objects are rooted trees and morphisms are order
embeddings preserving the root. We prove that finitely generated
representations of T are Noetherian using techniques developed by Sam and
Snowden which generalize classical Grobner theory. The proof uses a relative
version of Kruskals tree Theorem.
