Three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the surface layers of
the Sun intrinsically produce a predominantly horizontal magnetic field in the
photosphere. This is a robust result in the sense that it arises from
simulations with largely different initial and boundary conditions for the
magnetic field. While the disk-center synthetic circular and linear
polarization signals agree with measurements from Hinode, their center-to-limb
variation sensitively depends on the height variation of the horizontal and the
vertical field component and they seem to be at variance with the observed
behavior.
