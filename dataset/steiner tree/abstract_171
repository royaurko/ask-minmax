A protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) code design technique for
bandwidth-efficient coded modulation is presented. The approach jointly
optimizes the LDPC code node degrees and the mapping of the coded bits to the
bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) bit-channels. For BICM with uniform
input and for BICM with probabilistic shaping, binary-input symmetric-output
surrogate channels for the code design are used. The constructed codes for
uniform inputs perform as good as the multi-edge type codes of Zhang and
Kschischang (2013). For 8-ASK and 64-ASK with probabilistic shaping, codes of
rates 2/3 and 5/6 with blocklength 64800 are designed, which operate within
0.63dB and 0.69dB of continuous AWGN capacity for a target frame error rate of
1e-3 at spectral efficiencies of 1.38 and 4.25 bits/channel use, respectively.
