The future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will consist of several tens of
telescopes of different mirror sizes. CTA will provide next generation
sensitivity to very high energy photons from few tens of GeV to >100 TeV.
Several focal plane instrumentation options are currently being evaluated
inside the CTA consortium. In this paper, the current status of the FlashCam
prototyping project is described. FlashCam is based on a fully digital camera
readout concept and features a clean separation between photon detector plane
and signal digitization/triggering electronics.
