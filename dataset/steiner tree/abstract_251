We review (i) observations and numerical simulations of vortical flows in the
solar atmosphere and (ii) measurements of the horizontal magnetic field in
quiet Sun regions. First, we discuss various manifestations of vortical flows
and emphasize the role of magnetic fields in mediating swirling motion created
near the solar surface to the higher layers of the photosphere and to the
chromosphere. We reexamine existing simulation runs of solar surface
magnetoconvection with regard to vortical flows and compare to previously
obtained results. Second, we review contradictory results and problems
associated with measuring the angular distribution of the magnetic field in
quiet Sun regions. Furthermore, we review the Stokes-V-amplitude ratio method
for the lines Fe I 630.15 and 630.25 nm. We come to the conclusion that the
recently discovered two distinct populations in scatter plots of this ratio
must not bee interpreted in terms of 'uncollapsed' and 'collapsed' fields but
they stem from weak granular magnetic fields and weak canopy fields located at
the boundaries between granules and the intergranular space. Based on new
simulation runs, we reaffirm earlier findings of a predominance of the
horizontal field components over the vertical one, particularly in the upper
photosphere and at the base of the chromosphere.
