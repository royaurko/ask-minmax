Quintessence models leading to a constant equation of state are studied in
hyperbolic universes. General properties of the quintessence potentials V(phi)
are discussed, and for some special cases also the exact analytic expressions
for these potentials are derived. It is shown that the observed angular power
spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is in excellent agreement
with some of the quintessence models even in cases with negative curvature. It
is emphasized that due to a (w_phi, Omega_phi, Omega_c)-degeneracy a universe
with negative spatial curvature cannot be excluded.
