The {\em atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index} is a degree-based graph
topological index that found chemical applications. The problem of complete
characterization of trees with minimal $ABC$ index is still an open problem.
In~\cite{d-sptmabci-2014}, it was shown that trees with minimal ABC index do
not contain so-called {\em $B_k$-branches}, with $k \geq 5$, and that they do
not have more than four $B_4$-branches. Our main results here reveal that the
number of $B_1$ and $B_2$-branches are also bounded from above by small fixed
constants. Namely, we show that trees with minimal ABC index do not contain
more than four $B_1$-branches and more than eleven $B_2$-branches.
