This paper establishes expectation and variance asymptotics for statistics of
the Poisson-Voronoi approximation of general sets, as the underlying intensity
of the Poisson point process tends to infinity. Statistics of interest include
volume, surface area, Hausdorff measure, and the number of faces of
lower-dimensional skeletons. We also consider the complexity of the so-called
Voronoi zone and the iterated Voronoi approximation. Our results are
consequences of general limit theorems proved with an abstract Steiner-type
formula applicable in the setting of sums of stabilizing functionals.
