Two-side estimates for two-weighted discrete Hardy-type operators on a tree
are obtained. For general weights we prove the discrete analogue of Evans -
Harris - Pick theorem (it is a quite simple consequence from their result). It
gives the order estimate for the norm of the weighted summation operator, but
this estimate is rather complicated. Under some conditions on weights, we
obtain estimates which are more simple and convenient for applications.
