Given a family of 3-graphs F its codegree threshold coex(n, F) is the largest
number d=d(n) such that there exists an n-vertex 3-graph in which every pair of
vertices is contained in at least d 3-edges but which contains no member of F
as a subgraph. The codegree density gamma(F) is the limit of coex(n,F)/(n-2) as
n tends to infinity.
  In this paper we generalise a construction of Czygrinow and Nagle to bound
below the codegree density of complete 3-graphs: for all integers s>3, the
codegree density of the complete 3-graph on s vertices K_s satisfies
gamma(K_s)\geq 1-1/(s-2).
  We also provide constructions based on Steiner triple systems which show that
if this lower bound is sharp, then we do not have stability in general. In
addition we prove bounds on the codegree density for two other infinite
families of 3-graphs.
