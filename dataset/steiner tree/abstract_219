In this paper, we show that the minimum number of vertices whose removal
disconnects a connected strongly regular graph into non-singleton components,
equals the size of the neighborhood of an edge for many graphs. These include
blocks graphs of Steiner $2$-designs, many Latin square graphs and strongly
regular graphs whose intersection parameters are at most a quarter of their
valency.
