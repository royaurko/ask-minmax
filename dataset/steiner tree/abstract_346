The relation between parity-check matrices of quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes and biadjacency matrices of bipartite graphs supports
searching for powerful LDPC block codes. Using the principle of tailbiting,
compact representations of bipartite graphs based on convolutional codes can be
found.
  Bounds on the girth and the minimum distance of LDPC block codes constructed
in such a way are discussed. Algorithms for searching iteratively for LDPC
block codes with large girth and for determining their minimum distance are
presented. Constructions based on all-ones matrices, Steiner Triple Systems,
and QC block codes are introduced. Finally, new QC regular LDPC block codes
with girth up to 24 are given.
