It is shown that the cubical nerve of a strict omega-category is a sequence
of sets with cubical face operations and distinguished subclasses of thin
elements satisfying certain thin filler conditions. It is also shown that a
sequence of this type is the cubical nerve of a strict omega-category unique up
to isomorphism; the cubical nerve functor is therefore an equivalence of
categories. The sequences of sets involved are in effect the analogues of
cubical T-complexes appropriate for strict omega-categories. Degeneracies are
not required in the definition of these sequences, but can in fact be
constructed as thin fillers. The proof of the thin filler conditions uses chain
complexes and chain homotopies.
