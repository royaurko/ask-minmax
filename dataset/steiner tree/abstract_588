We show uniqueness of the spine of a Fleming-Viot particle system under
minimal assumptions on the driving process. If the driving process is a
continuous time Markov process on a finite space, we show that asymptotically,
when the number of particles goes to infinity, the branching rate for the spine
is twice that of a generic particle in the system, and every side branch has
the distribution of the unconditioned generic branching tree.
