It is widely believed that the heating of the chromosphere in quiet-Sun
internetwork regions is provided by dissipation of acoustic waves that are
excited by the convective motions close to the top of the convection zone and
in the photospheric overshoot layer. This view lately became challenged by
observations suggesting that the acoustic energy flux into the chromosphere is
too low, by a factor of at least ten. Based on a comparison of TRACE data with
synthetic image sequences for a three-dimensional simulation extending from the
top layers of the convection zone to the middle chromosphere, we come to the
contradicting conclusion that the acoustic flux in the model provides
sufficient energy for heating the solar chromosphere of internetwork regions.
The role of a weak magnetic field and associated electric current sheets is
also discussed.
