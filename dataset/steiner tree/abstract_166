This paper studies geometric and spectral properties of $S$-adic shifts and
their relation to continued fraction algorithms. Pure discrete spectrum for
$S$-adic shifts and tiling properties of associated Rauzy fractals are
established under a generalized Pisot assumption together with a geometric
coincidence condition. These general results extend the scope of the Pisot
substitution conjecture to the $S$-adic framework. They are applied to families
of $S$-adic shifts generated by Arnoux-Rauzy as well as Brun substitutions
(related to the respective continued fraction algorithms). It is shown that
almost all these shifts have pure discrete spectrum, which proves a conjecture
of Arnoux and Rauzy going back to the early nineties in a metric sense. We also
prove that each linearly recurrent Arnoux-Rauzy shift with recurrent directive
sequence has pure discrete spectrum. Using $S$-adic words related to Brun's
continued fraction algorithm, we exhibit bounded remainder sets and natural
codings for almost all translations on the two-dimensional torus.
