We introduce series-triangular graph embeddings and show how to partition
point sets with them. This result is then used to improve the upper bound on
the number of Steiner points needed to obtain compatible triangulations of
point sets. The problem is generalized to finding compatible triangulations for
more than two point sets and we show that such triangulations can be
constructed with only a linear number of Steiner points added to each point
set.
