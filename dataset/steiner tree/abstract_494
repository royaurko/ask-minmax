In recent years, stream data have become an immensely growing area of
research for the database, computer science and data mining communities. Stream
data is an ordered sequence of instances. In many applications of data stream
mining data can be read only once or a small number of times using limited
computing and storage capabilities. Some of the issues occurred in classifying
stream data that have significant impact in algorithm development are size of
database, online streaming, high dimensionality and concept drift. The concept
drift occurs when the properties of the historical data and target variable
change over time abruptly in such a case that the predictions will become
inaccurate as time passes. In this paper the framework of incremental
classification is proposed to solve the issues for the classification of stream
data. The Trie structure based incremental feature tree, Trie structure based
incremental FP (Frequent Pattern) growth tree and tree based incremental
classification algorithm are introduced in the proposed framework.
