Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is a process of identifying opinions in
large unstructured/structured data and then analysing polarity of those
opinions. Opinion mining and sentiment analysis have found vast application in
analysing online ratings, analysing product based reviews, e-governance, and
managing hostile content over the internet. This paper proposes an algorithm to
implement aspect level sentiment analysis. The algorithm takes input from the
remarks submitted by various teachers of a student. An aspect tree is formed
which has various levels and weights are assigned to each branch to identify
level of aspect. Aspect value is calculated by the algorithm by means of the
proposed aspect tree. Dictionary based method is implemented to evaluate the
polarity of the remark. The algorithm returns the aspect value clubbed with
opinion value and sentiment value which helps in concluding the summarized
value of remark.
