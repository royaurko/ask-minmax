We study a one-dimensional model of disordered electrons (also relevant for
random spin chains), which exhibits a delocalisation transition at
half-filling. Exact probability distribution functions for the Wigner time and
transmission coefficient are calculated. We identify and distinguish those
features of probability densities that are due to rare, trapping configurations
of the random potential from those which are due to the proximity to the
delocalisation transition.
