The spectral statistics in the strongly chaotic cardioid billiard are
studied. The analysis is based on the first 11000 quantal energy levels for odd
and even symmetry respectively. It is found that the level-spacing distribution
is in good agreement with the GOE distribution of random-matrix theory. In case
of the number variance and rigidity we observe agreement with the random-matrix
model for short-range correlations only, whereas for long-range correlations
both statistics saturate in agreement with semiclassical expectations.
Furthermore the conjecture that for classically chaotic systems the normalized
mode fluctuations have a universal Gaussian distribution with unit variance is
tested and found to be in very good agreement for both symmetry classes. By
means of the Gutzwiller trace formula the trace of the cosine-modulated heat
kernel is studied. Since the billiard boundary is focusing there are conjugate
points giving rise to zeros at the locations of the periodic orbits instead of
exclusively Gaussian peaks.
