Computing and storing probabilities is a hard problem as soon as one has to
deal with complex distributions over multiple random variables. The problem of
efficient representation of probability distributions is central in term of
computational efficiency in the field of probabilistic reasoning. The main
problem arises when dealing with joint probability distributions over a set of
random variables: they are always represented using huge probability arrays. In
this paper, a new method based on binary-tree representation is introduced in
order to store efficiently very large joint distributions. Our approach
approximates any multidimensional joint distributions using an adaptive
discretization of the space. We make the assumption that the lower is the
probability mass of a particular region of feature space, the larger is the
discretization step. This assumption leads to a very optimized representation
in term of time and memory. The other advantages of our approach are the
ability to refine dynamically the distribution every time it is needed leading
to a more accurate representation of the probability distribution and to an
anytime representation of the distribution.
