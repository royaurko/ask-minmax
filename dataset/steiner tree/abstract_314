I. Caprini's, G. Colangelo's, and H. Leutwyler's (CCL) article "Mass and
Width of the Lowest Resonance in QCD", Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 132001 (2006)
[hep-ph/0512364], is critically reviewed. The present comment is devoted to
complement a recent experimental discussion (D.V. Bugg, J. Phys. G 34, 151
(2007) [hep-ph/0608081]) of short-comings in the CCL analysis, by presenting
theoretical arguments pointing at a serious flaw in the theoretical formalism
used by CCL, and also at the unlikeliness of their tiny error bars in the
sigma-meson mass and width. The criticism made in the comment applies
analogously to the analysis on the kappa-meson mass performed in the article
"The K0*(800) scalar resonance from Roy-Steiner representations of pi K
scattering" published as S. Descotes-Genon and B. Moussallam, Eur. Phys. J. C
48, 553 (2006) [hep-ph/0607133].
