The broad application range of the predator-prey modelling enabled us to
apply it to represent the dynamics of the work-employment system. For the
adopted period, we conclude that this dynamics is chaotic in the beginning of
the time series and tends to less perturbed states, as time goes by, due to
public policies and hidden intrinsic system features. Basic Lotka-Volterra
approach was revised and adapted to the reality of the study. The final aim is
to provide managers with generalized theoretical elements that allow to a more
accurate understanding of the behavior of the work-employment system.
