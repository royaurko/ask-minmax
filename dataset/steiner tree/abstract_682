In the simplest universal extra-dimension models Kaluza-Klein (KK) parity
distinguishes the states with odd and even KK-number. We calculate the coupling
of a 2n-level top quark to a top quark and the Higgs scalar (both n = 0
states), absent at the tree level, which is mediated by strong interactions at
one-loop. We show that the strength of this coupling is independent of n. We
observe that the decay due to this coupling, which conserves KK-parity, can be
a few per cent of the phase space suppressed decay to two n-level states which
proceeds through tree-level couplings. We explore the prospects of verification
of this result at the Large Hadron Collider through the production of an n = 2
KK top-antitop pair both of which subsequently decay to a zero mode top
quark/antiquark and a Higgs boson.
