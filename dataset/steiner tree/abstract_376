The efficiency of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) depends on the
microscopic orientation of transition dipole moments of the molecular emitters.
The most effective materials used for light generation have threefold symmetry,
which prohibit a priori determination of dipole orientation due to the
degeneracy of the fundamental transition. Single-molecule spectroscopy reveals
that the model triplet emitter tris(2-phenylisoquinoline)iridium(III)
(Ir(piq)3) does not behave as a linear dipole, radiating with lower
polarization anisotropy than expected. Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in
the excited state, leading to a random selection of one of the three ligands to
form a charge transfer state with the metal. This non-deterministic
localization is revealed in switching of the degree of linear polarization of
phosphorescence. Polarization scrambling likely raises out-coupling efficiency
and should be taken into account when deriving molecular orientation of the
guest emitter within the OLED host from ensemble angular emission profiles.
