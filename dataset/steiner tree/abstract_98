The classification, up to isomorphism, of all self-embedding monomial power
permutations of Hamming Steiner triple systems of order n=2^m-1 for small m, m
< 23, is given. As far as we know, for m in {5,7,11,13,17,19}, all given
self-embeddings in closed surfaces are new. Moreover, they are cyclic for all m
and nonorientable at least for all m < 21. For any non prime m, the
nonexistence of such self-embeddings in a closed surface is proven.
