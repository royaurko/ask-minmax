We prove a general result about the decomposition on ergodic components of
group actions on boundaries of spherically homogeneous rooted trees. Namely, we
identify the space of ergodic components with the boundary of the orbit tree
associated with the action, and show that the canonical system of ergodic
invariant probability measures coincides with the system of uniform measures on
the boundaries of minimal invariant subtrees of the tree. A special attention
is given to the case of groups generated by finite automata. Few examples,
including the lamplighter group, Sushchansky group, and the, so called,
Universal group are considered in order to demonstrate applications of the
theorem.
