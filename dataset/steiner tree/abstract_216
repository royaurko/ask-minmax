We point out that there is a problem with the definition of homological
critical value (as defined in the widely cited paper \cite{stability} by
Cohen-Steiner, Edelsbrunner and Harer). Under that definition, the critical
value lemma of \cite{stability} in fact fails. We provide several
counterexamples and a definition (due to Bubenik and Scott
\cite{categorification}) we feel should be preferred and under which the
critical value lemma does indeed hold. One of the counterexamples we have found
is a height function on a compact smooth manifold. In the end we prove that,
despite all this, a modified version of the critical value lemma remains valid
under the original definition.
