In this work, we present an analysis of a data cube obtained with the
instrument IFU/GMOS Gemini North telescope centered on the nuclear region of
the LINER galaxy NGC 4579. This galaxy is known to have a type 1 AGN (see
Eracleous et al. 2002 for a review). The methodology used for the analysis of
the data cube was PCA tomography (Steiner et al. 2009), which consists of
applying the statistical tool known as principal component analysis (PCA) to
extract information from data cubes.
