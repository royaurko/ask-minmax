Higher chromatic numbers of simplicial complexes naturally generalize the
chromatic number of a graph. Yet, little is known on higher chromatic numbers
for specific simplicial complexes.
  The 2-chromatic number of any fixed surface is finite. However,
asymptotically the 2-chromatic number of surfaces becomes arbitrarily large
with growing genus (as we will see via Steiner triple systems). We show that
orientable surfaces of genus at least 20 and non-orientable surfaces of genus
at least 26 have a 2-chromatic number of at least 4. Via a projective Steiner
triple systems, we construct an explicit triangulation of a non-orientable
surface, of genus 2542 and with face vector $f=(127,8001,5334)$, that has
2-chromatic number 5 or 6. We also give orientable examples with 2-chromatic
numbers 5 and 6.
  For 3-dimensional manifolds, an iterated moment curve construction can be
used to produce triangulations with arbitrarily large 2-chromatic number [6,
18], but of tremendous size. Via a topological version of the geometric
construction of [18], we exhibit the first concrete triangulation of the
3-dimension sphere $S^3$, with face vector $f=(167,1579,2824,1412)$, that has
2-chromatic number 5.
