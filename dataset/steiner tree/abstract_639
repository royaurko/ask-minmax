We prove that every infinite sequence of skew-symmetric or symmetric matrices
M_1, M_2, ... over a fixed finite field must have a pair M_i, M_j (i<j) such
that M_i is isomorphic to a principal submatrix of the Schur complement of a
nonsingular principal submatrix in M_j, if those matrices have bounded
rank-width. This generalizes three theorems on well-quasi-ordering of graphs or
matroids admitting good tree-like decompositions; (1) Robertson and Seymour's
theorem for graphs of bounded tree-width, (2) Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle's
theorem for matroids representable over a fixed finite field having bounded
branch-width, and (3) Oum's theorem for graphs of bounded rank-width with
respect to pivot-minors.
