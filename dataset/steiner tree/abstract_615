We consider a group of agents on a graph who repeatedly play the prisoner's
dilemma game against their neighbors. The players adapt their actions to the
past behavior of their opponents by applying the win-stay lose-shift strategy.
On a finite connected graph, it is easy to see that the system learns to
cooperate by converging to the all-cooperate state in a finite time. We analyze
the rate of convergence in terms of the size and structure of the graph. [Dyer
et al., 2002] showed that the system converges rapidly on the cycle, but that
it takes a time exponential in the size of the graph to converge to cooperation
on the complete graph. We show that the emergence of cooperation is
exponentially slow in some expander graphs. More surprisingly, we show that it
is also exponentially slow in bounded-degree trees, where many other dynamics
are known to converge rapidly.
