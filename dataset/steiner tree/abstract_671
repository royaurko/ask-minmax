We quantify the amount of information filtered by different hierarchical
clustering methods on correlations between stock returns comparing it with the
underlying industrial activity structure. Specifically, we apply, for the first
time to financial data, a novel hierarchical clustering approach, the Directed
Bubble Hierarchical Tree and we compare it with other methods including the
Linkage and k-medoids. In particular, by taking the industrial sector
classification of stocks as a benchmark partition, we evaluate how the
different methods retrieve this classification. The results show that the
Directed Bubble Hierarchical Tree can outperform other methods, being able to
retrieve more information with fewer clusters. Moreover, we show that the
economic information is hidden at different levels of the hierarchical
structures depending on the clustering method. The dynamical analysis on a
rolling window also reveals that the different methods show different degrees
of sensitivity to events affecting financial markets, like crises. These
results can be of interest for all the applications of clustering methods to
portfolio optimization and risk hedging.
