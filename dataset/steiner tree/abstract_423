Excitation functions for total reaction cross sections, $\sigma_R$, were
measured for the light, mainly proton-rich nuclei $^6$Li, $^7$Be, $^{10}$B,
$^{9,10,11}$C, $^{12}$N, $^{13,15}$O, and $^{17}$Ne incident on a Si telescope
at energies between 15 and 53 MeV/nucleon. The telescope served as target,
energy degrader and detector. Proton-removal cross sections, $\sigma_{2p}$ for
$^{17}$Ne and $\sigma_p$ for most of the other projectiles, were also measured.
The strong absorption model reproduces the $A$-dependence of $\sigma_R$, but
not the detailed structure. Glauber multiple scattering theory and the JLM
folding model provided improved descriptions of the measured $\sigma_R$ values.
$rms$ radii, extracted from the measured $\sigma_R$ using the optical limit of
Glauber theory, are in good agreement with those obtained from high energy
data. One-proton removal reactions are described using an extended Glauber
model, incorporating second order noneikonal corrections, realistic single
particle densities, and spectroscopic factors from shell model calculations.
