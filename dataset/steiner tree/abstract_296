Recent Chandra observations have raised expectations that the objects RX
J185635-3754 and 3C58 are either bare strange quark stars or stars with
extended quark cores. However, these observations can also be interpreted in
terms of normal neutron stars. Essential requirements for either explanation
are that they simultaneously account for the observed (i) spectral features
(i.e., thermal or nonthermal, possible lines), (ii) bounds on the inferred mass
(M) and radius (R), and (iii) the cooling curves (effective temperatures T and
luminosities L vs. age). Compact stars offer the promise of delineating QCD at
finite baryon density (Lattimer and Prakash, 2001) in a fashion complementary
to relativistic heavy ion collider experiments, which largely address the
finite temperature, but baryon poor regime.
