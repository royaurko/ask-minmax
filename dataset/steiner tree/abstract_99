It is known that strict omega-categories are equivalent through the nerve
functor to complicial sets and to sets with complicial identities. It follows
that complicial sets are equivalent to sets with complicial identities. We
discuss these equivalences. In particular we give a conceptual proof that the
nerves of omega-categories are complicial sets, and a direct proof that
complicial sets are sets with complicial identities.
