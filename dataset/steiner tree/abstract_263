We give synthetic proofs of many new results in triangle geometry, focusing
especially on fixed points of certain affine maps which are defined in terms of
the cevian triangle $DEF$ of a point $P$ with respect to a given triangle
$ABC$, as well as the cevian triangle of the isotomic conjugate $P'$ of $P$
with respect to $ABC$. We prove a formula for the cyclocevian map in terms of
the isotomic and isogonal maps using an entirely synthetic argument, and show
that the complement $Q$ of the isotomic conjugate $P'$ has many interesting
properties. If $T_P$ is the affine map taking $ABC$ to $DEF$, we show
synthetically that $Q$ is the unique ordinary fixed point of $T_P$ when $P$ is
any point not lying on the sides of triangle $ABC$, its anti-complementary
triangle, or the Steiner circumellipse of $ABC$. We also show that $T_P(Q')=P$
if $Q'$ is the complement of $P$, and that the affine map $T_P T_{P'}$ is
either a homothety or a translation which always has the $P$-ceva conjugate of
$Q$ as a fixed point. Finally, we show that $P$ lies on the Steiner
circumellipse if and only if $T_PT_{P'}=K^{-1}$, where $K$ is the complement
map for $ABC$. This paper forms the foundation for several more papers to
follow, in which the conic on the 5 points $A,B,C,P,Q$ is studied and its
center is characterized as a fixed point of the map $\lambda=T_{P'} T_P^{-1}$.
