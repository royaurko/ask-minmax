A Steiner type formula for continuous translation invariant Minkowski
valuations is established. In combination with a recent result on the symmetry
of rigid motion invariant homogeneous bivaluations, this new Steiner type
formula is used to obtain a family of Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities for
rigid motion intertwining Minkowski valuations.
