Experimental information on low energy $\pi K$ scattering would shed light on
the poorly known OZI suppressed sector of ChPT. I describe recent work aimed at
generating such information based on available experimental data by setting up
and then solving with appropriate boundary conditions a non linear system of
equations of the Roy and Steiner type. First results of this analysis are
presented.
