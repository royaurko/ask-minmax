36 single genes of six plants inferred 18 unique trees using maximum
parsimony. Such incongruence is an important issue and how to reconstruct the
congruent tree still is one of the most challenges in molecular phylogenetics.
For resolving this problem, a genome-wide EST data mining approach was
systematically investigated by retrieving a large size of EST data of 144
shared genes of six green plants from GenBank. The results show that the
concatenated alignments approach overcame incongruence among single-gene
phylogenies and successfully reconstructed the congruent tree of six species
with 100% jackknife support across each branch when 144 genes was used.
Jackknife supports of correct branches increased with number of genes linearly,
but those of wrong branches also increased linearly. For inferring the
congruent tree, the minimum 30 genes were required. This approach may provide
potential power in resolving conflictions of phylogenies.
