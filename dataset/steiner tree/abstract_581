The electroproduction of eta and eta' mesons on the proton and the neutron is
investigated at tree level within the framework of U(3) chiral perturbation
theory. In addition to the Born terms low-lying resonances such as the vector
mesons and J^P= 1/2^+, 1/2^- baryon resonances are included explicitly and
their contributions are calculated. Results for the separated differential
cross sections are presented.
