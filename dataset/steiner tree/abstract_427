We study the structure of the photospheric magnetic field of the quiet Sun by
investigating weak spectro-polarimetric signals. We took a sequence of Stokes
spectra of the Fe I 630.15 nm and 630.25 nm lines in a region of quiet Sun near
the disk center, using the POLIS spectro-polarimeter at the German VTT on
Tenerife. The line cores of these two lines form at different heights in the
atmosphere. The 3$\sigma$ noise level of the data is about 1.8 $\times 10^{-3}
I_{c}$. We present co-temporal and co-spatial Stokes-$V$ profiles of the Fe I
630 nm line pair, where the two lines show opposite polarities in a single
spectrum. We compute synthetic line profiles and reproduce these spectra with a
two-component model atmosphere: a non-magnetic component and a magnetic
component. The magnetic component consists of two magnetic layers with opposite
polarity: the upper one moves upwards while the lower one moves downward.
In-between, there is a region of enhanced temperature. The Stokes-$V$ line pair
of opposite polarity in a single spectrum can be understood as a magnetic
reconnection event in the solar photosphere. We demonstrate that such a
scenario is realistic, but the solution may not be unique.
