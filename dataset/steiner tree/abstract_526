In Gou et al. (2011), we reported that the black hole primary in the X-ray
binary Cygnus X-1 is a near-extreme Kerr black hole with a spin parameter
a*>0.95(3{\sigma}). We confirm this result while setting a new and more
stringent limit: a*>0.983 at the 3{\sigma}(99.7%) level of confidence. The
earlier work, which was based on an analysis of all three useful spectra that
were then available, was possibly biased by the presence in these spectra of a
relatively strong Compton power-law component: The fraction of the thermal seed
photons scattered into the power law was f_s=23-31%, while the upper limit for
reliable application of the continuum-fitting method is f_s<25%. We have
subsequently obtained six additional spectra of Cygnus X-1 suitable for the
measurement of spin. Five of these spectra are of high quality with f_s in the
range 10% to 19%, a regime where the continuum-fitting method has been shown to
deliver reliable results. Individually, the six spectra give lower limits on
the spin parameter that range from a*>0.95 to a*>0.98, allowing us to
conservatively conclude that the spin of the black hole is a*>0.983
(3{\sigma}).
