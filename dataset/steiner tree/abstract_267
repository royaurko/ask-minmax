We consider so-called simple families of labelled trees, which contain, e.g.,
ordered, unordered, binary and cyclic labelled trees as special instances, and
study the global and local behaviour of the number of inversions. In particular
we obtain limiting distribution results for the total number of inversions as
well as the number of inversions induced by the node labelled j in a random
tree of size n.
