As separable states are a convex combination of product states, the geometry
of the manifold of product states is studied. Prior results by Sanpera, Vidal
and Tarrach are extended. Furthermore, it is proven that states in the set
tangent to the manifold of product states, at the maximally mixed state are
separable; the set normal constains, among others, all maximally entangled
states. A canonical decomposition is given. A surprising result is that for the
case of two particles, the closest product state to the maximally entangled
state is the maximally mixed state. An algorithm is provided to find the
closest product state.
