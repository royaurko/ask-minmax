We consider a dichotomy for analytic families of trees stating that either
there is a colouring of the nodes for which all but finitely many levels of
every tree are nonhomogeneous, or else the family contains an uncountable
antichain. This dichotomy implies that every nontrivial Souslin poset
satisfying the countable chain condition adds a splitting real.
  We then reduce the dichotomy to a conjecture of Sperner Theory. This
conjecture is concerning the asymptotic behaviour of the product of the sizes
of the m-shades of pairs of cross-t-intersecting families.
