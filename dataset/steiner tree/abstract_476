A tanglegram is a diagram, used in biology to compare phylogenetic trees,
consisting of two binary trees together with a matching of their leaves.
Unlabeled tanglegrams were recently counted by Billey, Konvalinka, and Matsen.
Using the theory of combinatorial species, we count three variations of
unlabeled tanglegrams: unordered, unrooted, and unordered unrooted tanglegrams.
