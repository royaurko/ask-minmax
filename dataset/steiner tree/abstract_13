The $q$-analogs of basic designs are discussed. It is proved that the
existence of any unknown Steiner structures, the $q$-analogs of Steiner
systems, implies the existence of unknown Steiner systems. Optimal $q$-analogs
covering designs are presented. Some lower and upper bounds on the sizes of
$q$-analogs covering designs are proved.
