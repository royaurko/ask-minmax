Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology have been
using a watt balance, NIST-3, to measure the Planck constant $h$ for over ten
years. Two recently published values disagree by more than one standard
uncertainty. The motivation for the present manuscript is twofold. First, we
correct the latest published number to take into account a recently discovered
systematic error in mass dissemination at the Bureau International des Poids et
Mesures (BIPM). Second, we provide guidance on how to combine the two numbers
into one final result. In order to adequately reflect the discrepancy, we added
an additional systematic uncertainty to the published uncertainty budgets. The
final value of $h$ measured with NIST-3 is $h = 6.626\,069\,36(37)\times
10^{-34}\,\mbox{J\,s}$. This result is $77(57) \times 10^{-9}$ fractionally
higher than $h_{\mathrm{90}}$. Each number in parentheses gives the value of
the standard uncertainty in the last two digits of the respective value and
$h_{\mathrm{90}}$ is the conventional value of the Planck constant given by
$h_{\mathrm{90}}\equiv 4 /( K_{\mathrm{J-90}}^2 R_{\mathrm{K-90}})$, where
$K_{\mathrm{J-90}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{K-90}}$ denote the conventional values of
the Josephson and von Klitzing constants, respectively.
