We show a possible way to construct a consistent formalism where the
effective electric charge can change with space and time without destroying the
invariance. In the previous work [1][2] we took the gauge coupling to be of the
form $g(\phi)j_\mu (A^{\mu} +\partial^{\mu}B)$ where $B$ is an auxiliary field,
$ \phi $ is a scalar field and the current $j_\mu$ is the Dirac current. This
term produces a constraint $ (\partial_{\mu}\phi) j^{\mu}=0 $ which can be
related to M.I.T bag model by boundary condition. In this paper we show that
when we use the term $ g(\phi)j_{\mu}(A^{\mu} -
\partial^{\mu}(\frac{1}{\square}\partial_{\rho}A^{\rho})) $, instead of the
auxiliary field $ B $, there is a possibility to produce a theory with
dynamical coupling constant, which does not produce any constraint or
confinement. The coupling $ j_{\mu}^{A}(A^{\mu} -
\partial^{\mu}(\frac{1}{\square}\partial_{\rho}A^{\rho})) $ where $ j_{\mu}^{A}
$ is an anomalous current also discussed.
