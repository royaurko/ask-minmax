The COMPASS experiment at CERN SPS will use hadron beams (pion, kaon and
proton) and muons at 50-280 GeV/c and virtual photon targets to investigate,
via Primakoff effect, important hadron properties: polarizability, chiral
anomaly, radiative transitions and hybrid meson production. We present
simulation studies to optimize the beam, detector setup and trigger for
measuring with high statistics above topics.
