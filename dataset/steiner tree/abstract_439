NGC 7582 was identified as a Starburst galaxy in the optical \cite[(Veron et
al. 1981)]{Veron et al.(1981)} but its X-Ray emission is typical of a Seyfert 1
galaxy \cite[(Ward et al. 1978)]{Ward et al.(1978)}. We analyzed a datacube of
this object obtained with the GMOS-IFU on the Gemini-South telescope. After a
subtraction of the stellar component using the {\sc starlight} code \cite[(Cid
Fernandes et al. 2005)]{Cid Fernandes et al. (2005)}, we looked for optical
signatures of the AGN. We detected a broad $H\alpha$ component (figure
\ref{fig1}) in the source where \cite[Bianchi et al.(2007)]{Bianchi et
al.(2007)} identified the AGN in an HST optical image. We also found a broad
$H\beta$ feature (figure \ref{fig2}), but its emission reveals a extended
source. We suggest that it is the light of the AGN scattered in the ionization
cone. We propose that NGC 7582 is a Seyfert 1 galaxy. A number of other
"hot-spots" and Wolf-Rayet features were also identified.
