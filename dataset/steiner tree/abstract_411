We consider first passage percolation (FPP) on T_d x Z, where T_d is the
d-regular tree (d>=3). It is shown that for a fixed vertex v in the tree, the
fluctuation of the distance in the FPP metric between the points (v,0) and
(v,n) is of the order of at most log n. We conjecture that the real
fluctuations are of order 1 and explain why.
