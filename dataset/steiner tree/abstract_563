Let F be a set of relational trees and let Forbh(F) be the class of all
structures that admit no homomorphism from any tree in F; all this happens over
a fixed finite relational signature $\sigma$. There is a natural way to expand
Forbh(F) by unary relations to an amalgamation class. This expanded class,
enhanced with a linear ordering, has the Ramsey property.
