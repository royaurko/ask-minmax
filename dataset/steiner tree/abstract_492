We introduce a hierarchical nonparametric model for probability measures
based on a multi-resolution transformation of probability distributions. The
model allows a varying amount of shrinkage to be applied to data features of
different scales and/or at different locations in the sample space, and the
varying shrinkage level is locally adaptive to the empirical behavior of the
data. Moreover, the model's hierarchical design---through a latent Markov tree
structure---allows borrowing of information across locations and scales in
setting the adaptive shrinkage level. Inference under the model proceeds
efficiently using general recipes for conjugate hierarchical models. We
illustrate the work of the model in density estimation and evaluate its
performance through simulation under several schematic scenarios carefully
designed to be representative of a variety of applications. We compare its
performance to those of several state-of-the-art nonparametric models---the
P\'olya tree, the optional P\'olya tree, and the Dirichlet process mixture of
normals. In addition, we establish several important theoretical properties for
the model including absolute continuity, full nonparametricity, and posterior
consistency.
