The theory of sparse structures usually uses tree like structures as building
blocks. In the context of sparse/dense dichotomy this role is played by graphs
with bounded tree depth. In this paper we survey results related to this
concept and particularly explain how these graphs are used to decompose and
construct more complex graphs and structures. In more technical terms we survey
some of the properties and applications of low tree depth decomposition of
graphs.
