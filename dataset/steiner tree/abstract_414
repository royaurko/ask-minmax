We present 14 nights of medium resolution (1-2\AA) spectroscopy of the
eclipsing cataclysmic variable UU Aquarii obtained during a high accretion
state in 1995 August-October. UU Aqr appears to be an SW Sextantis star, as
noted by Baptista, Steiner, & Horne (1996), and we discuss its spectroscopic
behavior in the context of the SW Sex phenomenon. Emission line equivalent
width curves, Doppler tomography, and line profile simulation provide evidence
for the presence of a bright spot at the impact site of the accretion stream
with the edge of the disk, and a non-axisymmetric, vertically- and
azimuthally-extended absorbing structure in the disk. The absorption has
maximum depth in the emission lines around orbital phase 0.8, but is present
from $\phi\approx0.4$ to $\phi\approx0.95$. An origin is explored for this
absorbing structure (as well as the other spectroscopic behavior of UU Aqr) in
terms of the explosive impact of the accretion stream with the disk.
