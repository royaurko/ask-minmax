Neutron stars provide a fertile environment for exploring superfluidity under
extreme conditions. It is not surprising that Cooper pairing occurs in dense
matter since nucleon pairing is observed in nuclei as energy differences
between even-even and odd-even nuclei. Since superfluids and superconductors in
neutron stars profoundly affect neutrino emissivities and specific heats, their
presence can be observed in the thermal evolution of neutron stars. An
ever-growing number of cooling neutron stars, now amounting to 13 thermal
sources, and several additional objects from which upper limits to temperatures
can be ascertained, can now be used to discriminate among theoretical scenarios
and even to dramatically restrict properties of nucleon pairing at high
densities. In addition, observations of pulsars, including their spin-downs and
glitch histories, additionally support the conjecture that superfluidity and
superconductivity are ubiquitous within, and important to our understanding of,
neutron stars.
