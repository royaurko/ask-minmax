The FlashCam group is currently preparing photomultiplier-tube based cameras
proposed for the medium-sized telescopes (MST) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array
(CTA). The cameras are designed around the FlashCam readout concept which is
the first fully-digital readout system for Cherenkov cameras, based on
commercial FADCs and FPGAs as key components for the front-end electronics
modules and a high performance camera server as back-end. This contribution
describes the progress of the full-scale FlashCam camera prototype currently
under construction, as well as performance results also obtained with earlier
demonstrator setups. Plans towards the production and implementation of
FlashCams on site are also briefly presented.
