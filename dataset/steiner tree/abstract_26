We study $S(t-1,t,2t)$, which is a special class of Steiner systems. Explicit
constructions for designing such systems are developed under a graph-theoretic
platform where Steiner systems are represented in the form of uniform
hypergraphs. The constructions devised are then used to study the $2$-coloring
properties of these uniform hypergraphs.
