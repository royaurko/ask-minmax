The class of $\left(\binom{n+1}{2}_{n-1}
\binom{n+1}{3}_3\right)$-configurations which contain at least $n-2$
$K_n$-graphs coincides with the class of so called systems of triangle
perspectives i.e. of configurations which contain a bundle of $n-2$ Pasch
configurations with a common line. For $n=5$ the class consists of all binomial
partial Steiner triple systems on $15$ points, that contain at least three
$K_5$-graphs. In this case a complete classification of respective
configurations is given and their automorphisms are determined.
