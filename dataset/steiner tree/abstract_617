For $f,g\in\omega\ho$ let $\mycfa_{f,g}$ be the minimal number of uniform
$g$-splitting trees needed to cover the uniform $f$-splitting tree, i.e. for
every branch $\nu$ of the $f$-tree, one of the $g$-trees contains $\nu$.
$\myc_{f,g}$ is the dual notion: For every branch $\nu$, one of the $g$-trees
guesses $\nu(m)$ infinitely often.
  It is consistent that
$\myc_{f_\epsilon,g_\epsilon}=\mycfa_{f_\epsilon,g_\epsilon}=\kappa_\epsilon$
for $\al1$ many pairwise different cardinals $\kappa_\epsilon$ and suitable
pairs $(f_\epsilon,g_\epsilon)$.
  For the proof we use creatures with sufficient bigness and halving. We show
that the lim-inf creature forcing satisfies fusion and pure decision. We
introduce decisiveness and use it to construct a variant of the countable
support iteration of such forcings, which still satisfies fusion and pure
decision.
