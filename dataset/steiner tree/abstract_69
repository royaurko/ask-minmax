The behavior of some high temperature superconductors (HTSC) such as $\rm
La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}$ and $\rm Bi_{2}Sr_{2-x}La_xCuO_{6+\delta}$, at very high
magnetic field, is similar to that of thin films of amorphous InOx near the
magnetic field-tuned superconductor-insulator transition. Analyzing the InOx
data at high fields in terms of persisting local pairing amplitude, we argue by
analogy that local pairing amplitude also persists well into the dissipative
state of the HTSCs, the regime commonly denoted as the "normal state" in very
high magnetic field experiments.
