For a (non-unit) Pisot number $\beta$, several collections of tiles are
associated with $\beta$-numeration. This includes an aperiodic and a periodic
one made of Rauzy fractals, a periodic one induced by the natural extension of
the $\beta$-transformation and a Euclidean one made of integral beta-tiles. We
show that all these collections (except possibly the periodic translation of
the central tile) are tilings if one of them is a tiling or, equivalently, the
weak finiteness property (W) holds. We also obtain new results on rational
numbers with purely periodic $\beta$-expansions; in particular, we calculate
$\gamma(\beta)$ for all quadratic $\beta$ with $\beta^2 = a \beta + b$,
$\gcd(a,b) = 1$.
