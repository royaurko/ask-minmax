In this paper, we prove that, if functions (concave) $\phi$ and (convex)
$\psi$ satisfy certain conditions, the $L_{\phi}$ affine surface area is
monotone increasing, while the $L_{\psi}$ affine surface area is monotone
decreasing under the Steiner symmetrization. Consequently, we can prove related
affine isoperimetric inequalities, under certain conditions on $\phi$ and
$\psi$, without assuming that the convex body involved has centroid (or the
Santal\'{o} point) at the origin.
