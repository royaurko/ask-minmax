We consider deformations of the Weyl arrangement of type $A_2$, which include
the extended Shi and Catalan arrangements. These last ones are well-known to be
free. We study their sheaves of logarithmic vector fields in all other cases,
and show that they are Steiner bundles. Also, we determine explicitly their
unstable lines. As a corollary, some counter-examples to the shift isomorphism
problem are given.
