We introduce the concept of a clique bitrade, which generalizes several known
types of bitrades, including latin bitrades, Steiner $T(k-1,k,v)$ bitrades,
extended $1$-perfect bitrades. For a distance-regular graph, we show a
one-to-one correspondence between the clique bitrades that meet the
weight-distribution lower bound on the cardinality and the bipartite isometric
subgraphs that are distance-regular with certain parameters. As an application
of the results, we find the minimum cardinality of $q$-ary Steiner
$T_q(k-1,k,v)$ bitrades and show a connection of minimum such bitrades with
dual polar subgraphs of the Grassmann graph $J_q(v,k)$. Keywords: bitrades,
trades, Steiner systems, subspace designs
