Let $v_1, ..., v_m$ be a finite set of unit vectors in $\RR^n$. Suppose that
an infinite sequence of Steiner symmetrizations are applied to a compact convex
set $K$ in $\RR^n$, where each of the symmetrizations is taken with respect to
a direction from among the $v_i$. Then the resulting sequence of Steiner
symmetrals always converges, and the limiting body is symmetric under
reflection in any of the directions $v_i$ that appear infinitely often in the
sequence. In particular, an infinite periodic sequence of Steiner
symmetrizations always converges, and the set functional determined by this
infinite process is always idempotent.
