This paper examines the complexity of hybrid logics over transitive frames,
transitive trees, and linear frames. We show that satisfiability over
transitive frames for the hybrid language extended with the downarrow operator
is NEXPTIME-complete. This is in contrast to undecidability of satisfiability
over arbitrary frames for this language (Areces, Blackburn, Marx 1999). It is
also shown that adding the @ operator or the past modality leads to
undecidability over transitive frames. This is again in contrast to the case of
transitive trees and linear frames, where we show these languages to be
nonelementarily decidable. Moreover, we establish 2EXPTIME and EXPTIME upper
bounds for satisfiability over transitive frames and transitive trees,
respectively, for the hybrid Until/Since language. An EXPTIME lower bound is
shown to hold for the modal Until language over both frame classes.
