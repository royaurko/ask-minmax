The robustness of entanglement results of Vidal and Tarrach considered the
problem whereby an entangled state is mixed with a separable state so that the
overall state becomes non-entangled. In general it is known that there are also
cases when entangled states are mixed with other entangled states and where the
sum is separable. In this paper, we treat the more general case where entangled
states can be mixed with any states so that the resulting mixture is
unentangled. It is found that entangled pure states for this generalized case
have the same robustness as the restricted case of Vidal and Tarrach.
