Our focus is on constructing a multiscale nonparametric prior for densities.
The Bayes density estimation literature is dominated by single scale methods,
with the exception of Polya trees, which favor overly-spiky densities even when
the truth is smooth. We propose a multiscale Bernstein polynomial family of
priors, which produce smooth realizations that do not rely on hard partitioning
of the support. At each level in an infinitely-deep binary tree, we place a
beta dictionary density; within a scale the densities are equivalent to
Bernstein polynomials. Using a stick-breaking characterization, stochastically
decreasing weights are allocated to the finer scale dictionary elements. A
slice sampler is used for posterior computation, and properties are described.
The method characterizes densities with locally-varying smoothness, and can
produce a sequence of coarse to fine density estimates. An extension for
Bayesian testing of group differences is introduced and applied to DNA
methylation array data.
