The intrinsic volumes of a convex cone are geometric functionals that return
basic structural information about the cone. Recent research has demonstrated
that conic intrinsic volumes are valuable for understanding the behavior of
random convex optimization problems. This paper develops a systematic technique
for studying conic intrinsic volumes using methods from probability. At the
heart of this approach is a general Steiner formula for cones. This result
converts questions about the intrinsic volumes into questions about the
projection of a Gaussian random vector onto the cone, which can then be
resolved using tools from Gaussian analysis. The approach leads to new
identities and bounds for the intrinsic volumes of a cone, including a
near-optimal concentration inequality.
