Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be joint $\{ \pm 1\}$-valued random variables. It is
known that conditioning on a random subset of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ of them reduces
their average pairwise covariance to below $\epsilon$ (in expectation). We
conjecture that $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ can be improved to $O(1/\epsilon)$. The
motivation for the problem and our conjectured improvement comes from the
theory of global correlation rounding for convex relaxation hierarchies. We
suggest attempting the conjecture in the case that $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are the
leaves of an information flow tree. We prove the conjecture in the case that
the information flow tree is a caterpillar graph (similar to a two-state hidden
Markov model).
