We study models where the gauge coupling constants, masses, etc are functions
of some conserved charge in the universe. We first consider the standard Dirac
action, but where the mass and the electromagnetic coupling constant are a
function of the charge in the universe and afterwards extend this scalar
fields. For Dirac field in the flat space formulation, the formalism is not
manifestly Lorentz invariant, however Lorentz invariance can be restored by
performing a phase transformation of the Dirac field. In the case where scalar
field are considered, there is the new feature that an initial condition for
the scalar field is derived from the action. In the case of the Higgs field,
the initial condition require, that the universe be at the false vacuum state
at a certain time slice, which is quite important for inflation scenarios. Also
false vacuum branes will be studied in a similar approach. We discuss also the
use of "spoiling terms", that violate gauge invariant to introduce these
initial condition.
