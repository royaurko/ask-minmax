In this paper, we study algebras of global dimension at most 2 whose
generalized cluster category is equivalent to the cluster category of an
acyclic quiver which is either a tree or of type $\widetilde{A}$. We are
particularly interested in their derived equivalence classification. We prove
that each algebra which is cluster equivalent to a tree quiver is derived
equivalent to the path algebra of this tree. Then we describe explicitly the
algebras of cluster type $\A_n$ for each possible orientation of $\A_n$. We
give an explicit way to read off in which derived equivalence class such an
algebra lies, and describe the Auslander-Reiten quiver of its derived category.
Together, these results in particular provide a complete classification of
algebras which are cluster equivalent to tame acyclic quivers.
