We define Schwarzenberger bundles on any smooth projective variety X. We
introduce the notions of jumping pairs of a Steiner bundle E on X and determine
a bound for the dimension of its jumping locus. We completely classify Steiner
bundles whose set of jumping pairs have maximal dimension, proving that they
are all Schwarzenberger bundles.
