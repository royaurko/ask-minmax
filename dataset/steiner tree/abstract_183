Magnetic cataclysmic variables are complex accreting binary systems with
short orbital periods. Here we present circular polarimetry of five magnetic
cataclysmic variable candidates. 1RXS J161008.0+035222, V1432 Aql, and 1RXS
J231603.9-052713 have cyclotron emission, which confirms them as AM Her
systems. Our data are consistent with zero values for the circular polarization
of 1RXS J042555.8-194534 and FIRST J102347.6+003841 imposing some constraints
to the polar classification of these objects.
