First, we fill in key gaps in Steiner's nice characterization of the most
nearly circular ellipse which passes through the vertices of a convex
quadrilateral, D. Steiner proved that there is only one pair of conjugate
directions, M1 and M2, that belong to all ellipses of circumscription. Then he
proves that if there is an ellipse, E, whose equal conjugate diameters possess
the directional constants M1 and M2, then E must be an ellipse of
circumscription which has minimal eccentricity. However, Steiner does not show
the existence or uniqueness of such an ellipse. We prove that there is a unique
ellipse of minimal eccentricity which passes through the vertices of D. We also
show that there exists an ellipse which passes through the vertices of D and
whose equal conjugate diameters possess the directional constants M1 and M2. We
also show that there exists a unique ellipse of minimal area which passes
through the vertices of D. Finally, we call a convex quadrilateral, D,
bielliptic if the unique inscribed and circumscribed ellipses of minimal
eccentricity have the same eccentricity. This generalizes the notion of
bicentric quadrilaterals. In particular we show the existence of a bielliptic
convex quadrilateral which is not bicentric.
