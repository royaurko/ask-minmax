From the works of Rauzy and Thurston, we know how to construct (multiple)
tilings of some Euclidean space using the conjugates of a Pisot unit $\beta$
and the greedy $\beta$-transformation. In this paper, we consider different
transformations generating expansions in base $\beta$, including cases where
the associated subshift is not sofic. Under certain mild conditions, we show
that they give multiple tilings. We also give a necessary and sufficient
condition for the tiling property, generalizing the weak finiteness property
(W) for greedy $\beta$-expansions. Remarkably, the symmetric
$\beta$-transformation does not satisfy this condition when $\beta$ is the
smallest Pisot number or the Tribonacci number. This means that the Pisot
conjecture on tilings cannot be extended to the symmetric
$\beta$-transformation. Closely related to these (multiple) tilings are natural
extensions of the transformations, which have many nice properties: they are
invariant under the Lebesgue measure; under certain conditions, they provide
Markov partitions of the torus; they characterize the numbers with purely
periodic expansion, and they allow determining any digit in an expansion
without knowing the other digits.
