We analyse the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the
Poincare dodecahedron which is an example for a multi-connected spherical
universe. We compare the temperature correlation function and the angular power
spectrum for the Poincare dodecahedral universe with the first-year WMAP data
and find that this multi-connected universe can explain the surprisingly low
CMB anisotropy on large scales found by WMAP provided that the total energy
density parameter Omega_tot is in the range 1.016...1.020. The ensemble average
over the primordial perturbations is assumed to be the scale-invariant
Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum. The circles-in-the-sky signature is studied and
it is found that the signal of the six pairs of matched circles could be missed
by current analyses of CMB sky maps.
