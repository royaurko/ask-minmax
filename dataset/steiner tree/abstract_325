The density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy is inspected using the
Statistical Multifragmentation Model with Skyrme effective interactions. The
model consistently considers the expansion of the fragments' volumes at finite
temperature at the freeze-out stage. By selecting parameterizations of the
Skyrme force that lead to very different equations of state for the symmetry
energy, we investigate the sensitivity of different observables to the
properties of the effective forces. Our results suggest that, in spite of being
sensitive to the thermal dilation of the fragments' volumes, it is difficult to
distinguish among the Skyrme forces from the isoscaling analysis. On the other
hand, the isotopic distribution of the emitted fragments turns out to be very
sensitive to the force employed in the calculation.
