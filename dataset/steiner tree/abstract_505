Data from the CCFR E770 Neutrino Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) experiment
at Fermilab contain events with large Bjorken x (x>0.7) and high momentum
transfer (Q^2>50 (GeV/c)^2). A comparison of the data with a model based on no
nuclear effects at large x, shows a significant excess of events in the data.
Addition of Fermi gas motion of the nucleons in the nucleus to the model does
not explain the excess. Adding a higher momentum tail due to the formation of
``quasi-deuterons'' makes some improvement. An exponentially falling F_2
\propto e^-s(x-x_0) at large x, predicted by ``multi-quark clusters'' and
``few-nucleon correlations'', can describe the data. A value of s=8.3 \pm
0.7(stat.)\pm 0.7(sys.) yields the best agreement with the data.
