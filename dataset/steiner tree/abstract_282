The matching energy is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the zeros
of the matching polynomial of a graph, which is proposed first by Gutman and
Wagner [The matching energy of a graph, Discrete Appl. Math. 160 (2012)
2177--2187]. And they gave some properties and asymptotic results of the
matching energy. In this paper, we characterize the trees with $n$ vertices
whose complements have the maximal, second-maximal and minimal matching energy.
Further, we determine the trees with a perfect matching whose complements have
the second-maximal matching energy. In particular, show that the trees with
edge-independence number number $p$ whose complements have the minimum matching
energy for $p=1,2,\ldots, \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$.
