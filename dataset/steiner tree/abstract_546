In this paper, we revisit two fundamental results of the self-stabilizing
literature about silent BFS spanning tree constructions: the Dolev et al
algorithm and the Huang and Chen's algorithm. More precisely, we propose in the
composite atomicity model three straightforward adaptations inspired from those
algorithms. We then present a deep study of these three algorithms. Our results
are related to both correctness (convergence and closure, assuming a
distributed unfair daemon) and complexity (analysis of the stabilization time
in terms of rounds and steps).
