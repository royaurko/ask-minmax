The nerve of a strict omega-category is a simplicial set with additional
structure, making it into a so-called complicial set, and strict
omega-categories are in fact equivalent to complicial sets. The nerve functor
is represented by a sequence of strict omega-categories, called orientals,
which are associated to simplexes. In this paper we give a detailed algebraic
description of the morphisms between orientals. The aim is to describe
complicial sets algebraically, by operators and equational axioms.
