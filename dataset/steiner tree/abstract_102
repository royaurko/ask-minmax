We define a variety of loops called semiautomorphic, inverse property loops
that generalize Moufang and Steiner loops. We first show an equivalence between
a previously studied variety of loops. Next we extend several known results for
Moufang and Steiner loops. That is, the commutant is a subloop and if $a$ is in
the commutant, then $a^{2}$ is a Moufang element, $a^{3}$ is a $c$-element and
$a^{6}$ is in the center. Finally, we give two constructions for
semiautomorphic inverse property loops based on Chein's and de Barros and
Juriaans' doubling constructions.
