Here we study the automorphism groups of $1$-designs constructed from finite
nonabelian simple groups by using two methods presented in Moori (Information
Security, Coding Theory and Related Combinatorics, 2011). We obtain some
general results for both and improve one of these methods. In an application to
the sporadic Mathieu groups $M_{n}$, we are able to retrieve the Steiner
systems $S(t,t+3,n)$ where $(n,t)\in\{(22,3),(23,4),(24,5)\}$.
