There are sequences of directions such that, given any compact set K in R^n,
the sequence of iterated Steiner symmetrals of K in these directions converges
to a ball. However examples show that Steiner symmetrization along a sequence
of directions whose differences are square summable does not generally
converge. (Note that this may happen even with sequences of directions which
are dense in S^{n-1}.) Here we show that such sequences converge in shape. The
limit need not be an ellipsoid or even a convex set.
  We also deal with uniformly distributed sequences of directions, and with a
recent result of Klain on Steiner symmetrization along sequences chosen from a
finite set of directions.
