Algorithms for (nondeterministic) finite-state tree automata (FTAs) are often
tested on random FTAs, in which all internal transitions are equiprobable. The
run-time results obtained in this manner are usually overly optimistic as most
such generated random FTAs are trivial in the sense that the number of states
of an equivalent minimal deterministic FTA is extremely small. It is
demonstrated that nontrivial random FTAs are obtained only for a narrow band of
transition probabilities. Moreover, an analytic analysis yields a formula to
approximate the transition probability that yields the most complex random
FTAs, which should be used in experiments.
