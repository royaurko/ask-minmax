In this paper we give a full expansion of the tail of the maximum of
stationary Gaussian fields on some regular sets in dimension 2. Adler and
Taylor or Aza\"is and Wschebor have given such a formula for locally convex
sets. We mainly consider the non locally convex cases. Our main tools are the
Steiner formula of the indexed set and a recent result of Aza\"is and Wschebor.
Various examples, including example in larger dimension are given. They
correspond to new results.
