The interest in $q$-analogs of codes and designs has been increased in the
last few years as a consequence of their new application in error-correction
for random network coding. One of the most intriguing problems is the existence
question of an infinite family of $q$-analog of Steiner systems (spreads not
included) in general, and the existence question for $q$-analog for the Fano
plane in particular. We exhibit a new method to attack this problem. In the
process we define a new family of designs whose existence is implied from the
existence of $q$-analog of Steiner systems, but their existence can be also
independent. We present necessary conditions for the existence for such
designs, trivial constructions for such designs, and a nontrivial recursive
construction. We consider the structure of the $q$-Fano plane for any given $q$
and conclude that most of its structure is known. Even so, we were unable to
determine whether it exists or not. A special attention is given for the case
$q=2$ which was considered by most researchers before.
