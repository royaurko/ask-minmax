Isotopes of C-loops with unique non-identity squares are shown to be both
C-loops and A-loops. The relationship between C-loops and Steiner loops is
further studied. Central loops with the weak and cross inverse properties are
also investigated. C-loops are found to be Osborn loops if every element in
them are squares.
