We will introduce a gauge model which an electromagnetic coupling constant
and local mass are related to all the charge in the universe. we will use the
standard Dirac action, but where the mass and the electromagnetic coupling
constant are a function of the sum of all the charge in the universe, which
represent Mach principle for electromagnetic coupling constant. The
formalisation is not manifestly Lorentz invariant, however Lorentz invariance
can be restored by performing a phase transformation of the Dirac field.
