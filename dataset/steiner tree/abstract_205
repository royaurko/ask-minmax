An $H(n,q,w,t)$ design is considered as a collection of $(n-w)$-faces of the
hypercube $Q^n_q$ perfectly piercing all $(n-t)$-faces. We define an
$A(n,q,w,t)$ design as a collection of $(n-t)$-faces of hypercube $Q^n_q$
perfectly cowering all $(n-w)$-faces. The numbers of H- and A-designs are
expressed in terms of multidimensional permanent. We present several
constructions of H- and A-design and prove the existence of
$H(2^{t+1},s2^t,2^{t+1}-1,2^{t+1}-2)$ designs for every $s,t\geq 1$.
