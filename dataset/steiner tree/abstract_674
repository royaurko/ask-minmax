Rare decays $h\to Z V$ with $V$ denoting the narrow $c\bar{c}$ or $b\bar{b}$
resonances, such as $J/\Psi$ or $\Upsilon$ states, have been analyzed. Within
the standard model, these channels may proceed through the tree-level
transition $h\to ZZ^*$ with the virtual $Z^*\to V$, and also loop-induced
process $h\to Z\gamma^*$, followed by $\gamma^*\to V$. Our analysis shows that,
for the bottomonium final states, the decay rate of $h\to Z \Upsilon$ from the
loop-induced process is small and the former transition gives the dominant
contribution; while, for the charmonium final states, $\Gamma(h\to Z J/\Psi)$
and $\Gamma(h\to Z\Psi(2S))$ induced by $h\to Z\gamma^* \to Z V$ could be
comparable to the contribution given by the tree-level $h\to ZZ^*\to Z V$
transition.
