In order to extend the investigation of laser-assisted cleaning of
ITER-relevant first mirror materials to the picosecond regime, a commercial
laser system delivering 10 picosecond pulses at 355 nm at a frequency of up to
1 MHz has been used to investigate the ablation of mixed aluminium (oxide) /
tungsten (oxide) layers deposited on poly- and nanocrystalline molybdenum as
well as nanocrystalline rhodium mirrors. Characterization before and after
cleaning using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectrophotometry shows
heavy dust formation, resulting in a degradation of the reflectivity. Cleaning
using a 5 nanosecond pulses at 350 and 532 nm, on the other hand, proved very
promising. The structure of the film remnants suggests that in this case
buckling was the underlying removal mechanism rather than ablation. Repeated
coating and cleaning using nanosecond pulses is demonstrated.
