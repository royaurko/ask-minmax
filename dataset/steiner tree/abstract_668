In this paper we show how the combination of Behaviour Tree and Utility Based
AI architecture can be used to design more realistic bots for Military
Simulators. In this work, we have designed a mathematical model of a simulator
system which in turn helps in analyzing the results and finding out the various
spaces on which our favorable situation might exist, this is done
geometrically. In the mathematical model, we have explained the matrix
formation and its significance followed up in dynamic programming approach we
explained the possible graph formation which will led improvisation of AI,
latter we explained the possible geometrical structure of the matrix operations
and its impact on a particular decision, we also explained the conditions under
which it tend to fail along with a possible solution in future works.
