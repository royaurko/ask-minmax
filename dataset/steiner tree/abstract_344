NGC 7582 is defined as a Starburst/AGN galaxy, since its optical and X-Ray
spectra reveal both characteristics. In this work, we show the results of a
stellar population modeling in a datacube taken with the Gemini South
telescope. We found that $\sim$ 90% of the light in the field of view is
emitted by stars that are less than 1 billion years old. A strong burst
occurred about $\sim$ 6 million years ago and has nearly solar metallicity. We
also found a Wolf-Rayet cluster.
