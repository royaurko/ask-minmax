We combine measurements of the longitudinal ($\rho_{xx}$) and Hall
($\rho_{xy}$) resistivities of disordered two-dimensional amorphous
indium-oxide films to study the magnetic-field tuned superconductor to
insulator transition in the $T \to 0$ limit. We find the transition exhibits
signatures of self-duality, and separates the superconducting state from a
"Hall-insulator" phase. A higher characteristic magnetic field at which the
Hall resistance is $T$ independent marks a crossover to a Fermi-insulator, at
which point $\rho_{xy}$ reaches the normal-state value of $H/nec$.
