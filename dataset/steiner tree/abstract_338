The properties of the nuclear isoscaling at finite temperature are
investigated and the extent to which its parameter $\alpha$ holds information
on the symmetry energy is examined. We show that, although finite temperature
effects invalidate the analytical formulas that relate the isoscaling parameter
$\alpha$ to those of the mass formula, the symmetry energy remains the main
ingredient that dictates the behavior of $\alpha$ at finite temperatures, even
for very different sources. This conclusion is not obvious as it is not true in
the vanishing temperature limit, where analytical formulas are available. Our
results also reveal that different statistical ensembles lead to essentially
the same conclusions based on the isoscaling analysis, for the temperatures
usually assumed in theoretical calculations in the nuclear multifragmentation
process.
