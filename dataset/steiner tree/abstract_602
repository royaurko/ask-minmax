We introduce a proof system for Hajek's logic BL based on a relational
hypersequents framework. We prove that the rules of our logical calculus,
called RHBL, are sound and invertible with respect to any valuation of BL into
a suitable algebra, called omega[0,1]. Refining the notion of reduction tree
that arises naturally from RHBL, we obtain a decision algorithm for BL
provability whose running time upper bound is 2^O(n), where n is the number of
connectives of the input formula. Moreover, if a formula is unprovable, we
exploit the constructiveness of a polynomial time algorithm for leaves validity
for providing a procedure to build countermodels in omega[0,1]. Finally, since
the size of the reduction tree branches is O(n^3), we can describe a polynomial
time verification algorithm for BL unprovability.
