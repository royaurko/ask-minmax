We consider the one-loop effective potential at zero and finite temperature
in scalar field theories with anisotropic space-time scaling. For $z=2$, there
is a symmetry breaking term induced at one-loop at zero temperature and we find
symmetry restoration through a first-order phase transition at high
temperature. For $z=3$, we considered at first the case with a positive mass
term at tree level and found no symmetry breaking effects induced at one-loop,
and then we study the case with a negative mass term at tree level where we
cannot conclude about symmetry restoration effects at high temperature because
of the imaginary parts that appear in the effective potential for small values
of the scalar field.
