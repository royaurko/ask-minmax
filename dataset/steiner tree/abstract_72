It has been suggested that the modified Steiner action functional has
desirable properties for a random surface action. In this paper we investigate
the scaling of the string tension and massgap in a variant of this action on
dynamically triangulated random surfaces and compare the results with the
gaussian plus extrinsic curvature actions that have been used previously.
