The level structure of the unbound nucleus 11N has been studied by 10C+p
elastic resonance scattering in inverse geometry with the LISE3 spectrometer at
GANIL, using a 10C beam with an energy of 9.0 MeV/u. An additional measurement
was done at the A1200 spectrometer at MSU. The excitation function above the
10C+p threshold has been determined up to 5 MeV. A potential-model analysis
revealed three resonance states at energies 1.27 (+0.18-0.05) MeV (Gamma=1.44
+-0.2 MeV), 2.01(+0.15-0.05) MeV, (Gamma=0.84 +-$0.2 MeV) and 3.75(+-0.05) MeV,
(Gamma=0.60 +-0.05 MeV) with the spin-parity assignments I(pi) =1/2+, 1/2- and
5/2+, respectively. Hence, 11N is shown to have a ground state parity inversion
completely analogous to its mirror partner, 11Be. A narrow resonance in the
excitation function at 4.33 (+-0.05) MeV was also observed and assigned
spin-parity 3/2-.
