We present a technique for the animation of a 3D kinematic tongue model, one
component of the talking head of an acoustic-visual (AV) speech synthesizer.
The skeletal animation approach is adapted to make use of a deformable rig
controlled by tongue motion capture data obtained with electromagnetic
articulography (EMA), while the tongue surface is extracted from volumetric
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Initial results are shown and future
work outlined.
