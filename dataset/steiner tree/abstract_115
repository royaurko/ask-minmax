A $\mu$-way $(v,k,t)$ $trade$ of volume $m$ consists of $\mu$ disjoint
collections $T_1$, $T_2, \dots T_{\mu}$, each of $m$ blocks, such that for
every $t$-subset of $v$-set $V$ the number of blocks containing this t-subset
is the same in each $T_i\ (1\leq i\leq \mu)$. In other words any pair of
collections $\{T_i,T_j\}$, $1\leq i<j \leq \mu$ is a $(v,k,t)$ trade of volume
$m$.
  In this paper we investigate the existence of $\mu$-way $(v,k,t)$ trades and
also we prove the existence of: (i)~3-way $(v,k,1)$ trades (Steiner trades) of
each volume $m,m\geq2$. (ii) 3-way $(v,k,2)$ trades of each volume $m,m\geq6$
except possibly $m=7$. We establish the non-existence of 3-way $(v,3,2)$ trade
of volume 7. It is shown that the volume of a 3-way $(v,k,2)$ Steiner trade is
at least $2k$ for $k\geq4$. Also the spectrum of 3-way $(v,k,2)$ Steiner trades
for $k=3$ and 4 are specified.
