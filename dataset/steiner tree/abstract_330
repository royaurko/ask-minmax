NGC 404, at a distance of 3.4 Mpc, is the nearest S0 galaxy. This galaxy
harbors a LINER; however, since the spectrum does not show a broad H{\alpha}
emission, it is not certain that this LINER is a low luminosity AGN and its
nature is still an open question. HST observations show the existence of
stellar populations with an age of 3 x 10^8 years years in the galactic bulge
and with an age of 6-15 x 10^9 years in the galactic disk. In this work, we
present an analysis of the data cube of NGC 404 obtained with the IFU (Integral
Field Unity) of the GMOS (Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph) on the Gemini North
telescope.
