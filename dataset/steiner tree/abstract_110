Very recently, an operator channel was defined by Koetter and Kschischang
when they studied random network coding. They also introduced constant
dimension codes and demonstrated that these codes can be employed to correct
errors and/or erasures over the operator channel. Constant dimension codes are
equivalent to the so-called linear authentication codes introduced by Wang,
Xing and Safavi-Naini when constructing distributed authentication systems in
2003. In this paper, we study constant dimension codes. It is shown that
Steiner structures are optimal constant dimension codes achieving the
Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound. Furthermore, we show that constant dimension
codes achieve the Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound if and only if they are certain
Steiner structures. Then, we derive two Johnson type upper bounds, say I and
II, on constant dimension codes. The Johnson type bound II slightly improves on
the Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound. Finally, we point out that a family of known
Steiner structures is actually a family of optimal constant dimension codes
achieving both the Johnson type bounds I and II.
