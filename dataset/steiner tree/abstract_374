A new coded modulation scheme is proposed. At the transmitter, the
concatenation of a distribution matcher and a systematic binary encoder
performs probabilistic signal shaping and channel coding. At the receiver, the
output of a bitwise demapper is fed to a binary decoder. No iterative demapping
is performed. Rate adaption is achieved by adjusting the input distribution and
the transmission power. The scheme is applied to bipolar amplitude shift keying
(ASK) constellations with equidistant signal points and it is directly
applicable to two-dimensional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The scheme
is implemented by using the DVB-S2 low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. At a
frame error rate of 1e-3, the new scheme operates within less than 1 dB of the
AWGN capacity 0.5log2(1+SNR) at any spectral efficiency between 1 and 5
bits/s/Hz by using only 5 modes, i.e., 4-ASK with code rate 2/3, 8-ASK with
3/4, 16-ASK and 32-ASK with 5/6 and 64-ASK with 9/10.
