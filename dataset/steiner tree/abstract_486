We extend earlier results on conditioning of super-Brownian motion to general
branching rules. We obtain representations of the conditioned process, both as
an $h$-transform, and as an unconditioned superprocess with immigration along a
branching tree. Unlike the finite-variance branching setting, these trees are
no longer binary, and strictly positive mass can be created at branch points.
This construction is singular in the case of stable branching. We analyze this
singularity first by approaching the stable branching function via analytic
approximations. In this context the singularity of the stable case can be
attributed to blow up of the mass created at the first branch of the tree.
Other ways of approaching the stable case yield a branching tree that is
different in law. To explain this anomaly we construct a family of martingales
whose backbones have multiple limit laws.
