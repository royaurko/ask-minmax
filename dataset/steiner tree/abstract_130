The (-\beta)-integers are natural generalisations of the \beta-integers, and
thus of the integers, for negative real bases. They can be described by
infinite words which are fixed points of anti-morphisms. We show that they are
not necessarily uniformly discrete and relatively dense in the real numbers.
