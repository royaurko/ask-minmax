We present results for the electroweak radiative corrections to the
production of a leptonically decaying Z boson in association with two jets at
the LHC. Tree-level and one-loop amplitudes have been obtained with the
computer code Recola for the recursive generation of tree-level and one-loop
amplitudes in the Standard Model. The one-loop integrals have been calculated
with the tensor-integral library Collier. The electroweak corrections turn out
to be small for inclusive cross sections but can become large in tails of
distributions.
