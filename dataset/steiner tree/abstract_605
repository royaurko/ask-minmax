We study string realizations of split extended supersymmetry, recently
proposed in hep-ph/0507192. Supersymmetry is broken by small ($\epsilon $)
deformations of intersection angles of $D$-branes giving tree-level masses of
order $m_0^2\sim \epsilon M_s^2$, where $M_s$ is the string scale, to localized
scalars. We show through an explicit one-loop string amplitude computation that
gauginos acquire hierarchically smaller Dirac masses $m_{1/2}^D \sim
m_0^2/M_s$. We also evaluate the one-loop Higgsino mass, $\mu$, and show that,
in the absence of tree-level contributions, it behaves as $\mu\sim
m_0^4/M_s^3$. Finally we discuss an alternative suppression of scales using
large extra dimensions. The latter is illustrated, for the case where the gauge
bosons appear in N=4 representations, by an explicit string model with Standard
Model gauge group, three generations of quarks and leptons and gauge coupling
unification.
