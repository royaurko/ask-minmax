The field-induced magnetic order in the singlet-ground-state system
CsFeCl$_3$ has been studied by measuring magnetization and neutron diffraction.
The field dependence of intensity for the neutron magnetic reflection has
clearly demonstrated that the field-induced ordered phase is described by the
order parameter $<S_x>$. A condensate growth of magnons is investigated through
the temperature dependence of $M_z$ and $M_{\perp}$, and this ordering is
discussed in the context of a magnon Bose-Einstein condensation. Development of
the coherent state and the static correlation length has been observed in the
incommensurate phase in the field region of $5 < H < 6$ T at 1.8 K. At $H >
H_{\rm c}$, a satellite peak was found in coexistence with the commensurate
peak at the phase boundary around 10 T, which indicates that the tilt of the
c-axis would be less than $\sim 0.5^{\circ}$ in the whole experiments.
