In this paper we describe an algorithm visiting all numerical semigroups up
to a given genus using a well suited representation. The interest of this
algorithm is that it fits particularly well the architecture of modern
computers allowing very large optimizations: we obtain the number of numerical
semigroups of genus g 67 and we confirm the Wilf conjecture for g 60.
