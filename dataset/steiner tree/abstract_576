In IIB orientifold models, the singlet twisted moduli appear in the
tree-level gauge kinetic function. They might be responsible for generating
gaugino masses if they acquire non-vanishing F-terms. We discuss some aspects
of this new possibility, such as the size of gaugino masses and their
non-universalities. A possible brane setting is presented to illustrate the
usefulness of these new sources.
