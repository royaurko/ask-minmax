For the past two years, measurements have been performed with a watt balance
at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to determine the
Planck constant. A detailed analysis of these measurements and their
uncertainties has led to the value $h=6.626\,069\,79(30)\times
10^{-34}\,$J$\,$s. The relative standard uncertainty is $ 45\times 10^{-9}$.
This result is $141\times 10^{-9}$ fractionally higher than $h_{90}$. Here
$h_{90}$ is the conventional value of the Planck constant given by
$h_{90}\equiv 4 /( K_{\mathrm{J-90}}^2R_{\mathrm{K-90}})$, where
$K_{\mathrm{J-90}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{K-90}}$ denote the conventional values of
the Josephson and von Klitzing constants, respectively.
