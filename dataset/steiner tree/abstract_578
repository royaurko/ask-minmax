The decay of the Higgs particle into two gravitons was previously calculated
by us using a Born term from the Einstein field equations. Subsequently, others
computed the same decay via one loop diagrams but omitting the Born terms. Here
all of the diagrams up to one loop are discussed, and it is shown that the Born
term is overwhelmingly dominant in agreement with our original results.
