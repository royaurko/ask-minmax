The search for a point set configurations of the R^3 space which contains the
smallest value of the Euclidean Steiner Ratio is almost finished. In the
present work we introduce some analytical methods which aim to support a famous
conjecture of Discrete Mathematics literature. The relations of this problem
with that of molecular architecture in terms of motivation as well as
application of the formulae obtained is also emphasized.
