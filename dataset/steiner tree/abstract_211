We present the experimental reconstruction of sub-wavelength features from
the far-field of sparse optical objects. We show that it is sufficient to know
that the object is sparse, and only that, and recover 100 nm features with the
resolution of 30 nm, for an illuminating wavelength of \lambda=532 nm. Our
technique works in real-time, requires no scanning, and can be implemented in
all existing microscopes - optical and non-optical.
