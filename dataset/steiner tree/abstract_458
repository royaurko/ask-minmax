We analyze a large set of new and archival photometric and spectroscopic
observations of LMC X-3 to arrive at a self-consistent dynamical model for the
system. Using echelle spectra obtained with the MIKE instrument on the 6.5m
Magellan Clay telescope and the UVES instrument on the second 8.2m Very Large
Telescope we find a velocity semiamplitude for the secondary star of
$K_2=241.1\pm 6.2$ km s$^{-1}$, where the uncertainty includes an estimate of
the systematic error caused by X-ray heating. Using the spectra, we also find a
projected rotational velocity of $V_{\rm rot}\sin i=118.5\pm 6.6$ km s$^{-1}$.
From an analysis of archival $B$ and $V$ light curves as well as new $B$ and
$V$ light curves from the SMARTS 1.3m telescope, we find an inclination of
$i=69.84\pm 0.37^{\circ}$ for models that do not include X-ray heating and an
inclination of $i=69.24\pm 0.72^{\circ}$ for models that incorporate X-ray
heating. Adopting the latter inclination measurement, we find masses of
$3.63\pm 0.57\,M_{\odot}$ and $6.98\pm 0.56\,M_{\odot}$ for the companion star
and the black hole, respectively. We briefly compare our results with earlier
work and discuss some of their implications.
