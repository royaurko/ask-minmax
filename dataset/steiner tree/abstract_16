We introduce an operation of a kind of product which associates with a
partial Steiner triple system another partial Steiner triple system, the
starting one being a quotient of the result. We discuss relations of our
product to some other product-like constructions and prove some
preservation/non-preservation theorems. In particular, we show series of
anti-Pasch Steiner triple systems which are obtained that way.
