We study natural linear representations of self-similar groups over finite
fields. In particular, we show that if the group is generated by a finite
automaton, then obtained matrices are automatic. This shows a new relation
between two separate notions of automaticity: groups generated by automata and
automatic sequences. We also show that if the group acts on the tree by
$p$-adic automorphisms, then the corresponding linear representation is a
representation by infinite triangular matrices. We relate this observation with
the notion of height of an automorphism of a rooted tree due to L.Kaloujnine.
