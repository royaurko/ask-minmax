We continue our reformulation of free dendriform algebras, dealing this time
with the free dendriform trialgebra generated be Y over planar rooted trees. We
propose a 'deformation' of a vectorial coding used in Part I, giving a
LL-lattice on rooted planar trees according to the terminology of A. Blass and
B. E. Sagan. The three main operations on trees become explicit, giving thus a
complementary approach to a very recent work of P. palacios and M. Ronco. Our
parenthesis framework allows a more tractable reformulation to explore the
properties of the underlying lattice describing operations and simplify a proof
of a fundamental theorem related to arithmetics over trees, the so-called
arithmetree. Arithmetree is then viewed as a noncommutative extention of
(N,+,x), the integers being played by the corollas. We give also two
representations of the super Catalan numbers or Schroder numbers.
