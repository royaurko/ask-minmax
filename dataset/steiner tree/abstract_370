We fitted all of the several hundred {\it RXTE} PCA spectra of the Crab
individually to a simple power-law model; the total number of counts in the
composite spectrum is $>10^9$. We then used the spectrum of residuals to derive
a calibration tool, called {\tt pcacorr}, that we apply to large samples of
spectra for GX~339--4, H1743--322, and XTE J1550--564. Application of the tool
improved the quality of all the fits, and the improvement is dramatic for
spectra with $\gtrsim10^7$ counts. The Crab residual spectrum is somewhat
different for each of the five PCA detectors, but it was relatively stable over
the course of the mission. We recommend that {\tt pcacorr} be routinely applied
to spectra with $\gtrsim10^6$ counts and that one include a systematic error of
0.1\%, rather than the 0.5--1\% value that has customarily been used. We expect
that application of the tool will result in an increase in sensitivity of the
PCA to faint spectral features by up to an order of magnitude.
