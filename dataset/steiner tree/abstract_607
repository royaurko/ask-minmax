We give a proof of BCFW recursion relations for all tree-level amplitudes of
gravitons in General Relativity. The proof follows the same basic steps as in
the BCFW construction and it is an extension of the one given for next-to-MHV
amplitudes by one of the contributors and P. Svr\v{c}ek in hep-th/0502160. The main
obstacle to overcome is to prove that deformed graviton amplitudes vanish as
the complex variable parameterizing the deformation is taken to infinity. This
step is done by first proving an auxiliary recursion relation where the
vanishing at infinity follows directly from a Feynman diagram analysis. The
auxiliary recursion relation gives rise to a representation of gravity
amplitudes where the vanishing under the BCFW deformation can be directly
proven. Since all our steps are based only on Feynman diagrams, our proof
completely establishes the validity of BCFW recursion relations. This means
that many results in the literature that were derived assuming their validity
become true statements.
