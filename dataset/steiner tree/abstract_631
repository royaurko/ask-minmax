We exhibit a monoidal structure on the category of finite sets indexed by
P-trees for a finitary polynomial endofunctor P. This structure categorifies
the monoid scheme (over Spec N) whose semiring of functions is (a P-version of)
the Connes--Kreimer bialgebra H of rooted trees (a Hopf algebra after base
change to Z and collapsing H_0). The monoidal structure is itself given by a
polynomial functor, represented by three easily described set maps; we show
that these maps are the same as those occurring in the polynomial
representation of the free monad on P.
