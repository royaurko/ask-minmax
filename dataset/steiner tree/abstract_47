It is predicted by Schrodinger's equation that entanglement will occur in the
interaction between detector and particle. We provide an analysis of the
entanglement using the Gurvitz model of double-dot and detector. New results on
entangled doubled-dots are provided as well as implications on Quantum
Information processing.
