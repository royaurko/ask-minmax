Consider the generalized iterated wreath product $S_{r_1}\wr \ldots \wr
S_{r_k}$ of symmetric groups. We find a bijection between the equivalence
classes of irreducible representations of the generalized iterated wreath
product with orbits of labels on certain rooted trees. We find a recursion for
the number of these labels and the degrees of irreducible representations of
the generalized iterated wreath product. We give upper bound estimates for fast
Fourier transforms.
