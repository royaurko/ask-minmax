We address the question of the "partition regularity" of the Pythagorean
equation a^2+b^2=c^2; in particular, can the natural numbers be assigned a
2-coloring, so that no Pythagorean triple (i.e., a solution to the equation) is
monochromatic? We prove that the hypergraph of Pythagorean triples can contain
no Steiner triple systems, a natural obstruction to 2-colorability. Then, after
transforming the question into one about 3-CNF satisfiability and applying some
reductions, a SAT solver is used to find a 2-coloring for {1,...,7664}. Work
continues as we seek to improve the reductions and extend the computation.
