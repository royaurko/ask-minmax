We provide new examples of acylindrically hyperbolic groups arising from
actions on simplicial trees. In particular, we consider amalgamated products
and HNN-extensions, 1-relator groups, automorphism groups of polynomial
algebras, 3-manifold groups and graph products. Acylindrical hyperbolicity is
then used to obtain some results about the algebraic structure, analytic
properties and measure equivalence rigidity of groups from these classes.
