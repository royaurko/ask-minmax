Constraints on the EoS for symmetric matter (equal neutron and proton
numbers) at supra-saturation densities have been extracted from energetic
collisions of heavy ions. Collisions of neutron-deficient and neutron-rich
heavy ions now provide initial constraints on the EoS of neutron-rich matter at
sub-saturation densities. Comparisons are made to other available constraints.
