Nuclear effective interactions are useful tools in astrophysical applications
especially if one can guide the extrapolations to the extremes regions of
isospin and density that are required to simulate dense, neutron-rich systems.
Isospin extrapolations may be constrained in the laboratory by measuring the
neutron skin thickness of a heavy nucleus, such as 208Pb. Similarly, future
observations of massive neutron stars will constrain the extrapolations to the
high-density domain. In this contribution we introduce a new relativistic
effective interaction that is simultaneously constrained by the properties of
finite nuclei, their collective excitations, and neutron-star properties. By
adjusting two of the empirical parameters of the theory, one can efficiently
tune the neutron skin thickness of 208Pb and the maximum neutron star mass. We
illustrate this procedure in response to the recent interpretation of X-ray
observations by Steiner, Lattimer, and Brown that suggests that the FSUGold
effective interaction predicts neutron star radii that are too large and a
maximum stellar mass that is too small. The new effective interaction is fitted
to a neutron skin thickness in 208Pb of only R_n - R_p = 0.16 fm and a
moderately large maximum neutron star mass of 1.94 Msun.
