Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory was able to get three- (and even
four-) loop results for finite Lattice QCD renormalization constants. More
recently, a conceptual and technical framework has been devised to tame finite
size effects, which had been reported to be significant for (logarithmically)
divergent renormalization constants. In this work we present three-loop results
for fermion bilinears in the Lattice QCD regularization defined by tree-level
Symanzik improved gauge action and n_f=2 Wilson fermions. We discuss both
finite and divergent renormalization constants in the RI'-MOM scheme. Since
renormalization conditions are defined in the chiral limit, our results also
apply to Twisted Mass QCD, for which non-perturbative computations of the same
quantities are available. We emphasize the importance of carefully accounting
for both finite lattice space and finite volume effects. In our opinion the
latter have in general not attracted the attention they would deserve.
