Thin flexible sheets of high-permeability FINEMET foils encased in thin
plastic layers have been used to shield various types of 20-cm-diameter
photomultiplier tubes from ambient magnetic fields. In the presence of the
Earth's magnetic field this type of shielding is shown to increase the
collection efficiency of photoelectrons and can improve the uniformity of
response of these photomultiplier tubes.
