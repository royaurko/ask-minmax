The low multipoles of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy
possess some strange properties like the alignment of the quadrupole and the
octopole, and the extreme planarity or the extreme sphericity of some
multipoles, respectively. In this paper the CMB anisotropy of several
multi-connected space forms is investigated with respect to the maximal angular
momentum dispersion and the Maxwellian multipole vectors in order to settle the
question whether such spaces can explain the low multipole anomalies in the
CMB.
