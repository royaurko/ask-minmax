Close Binary Supersoft X-ray Sources (CBSS) are considered strong candidates
to SN Ia progenitors, but very few CBSS are known in our Galaxy. The galactic
counterparts of the CBSS may be the V Sge stars, not detected in X-rays due to
the strong absorption by the interstellar gas. Nevertheless, the number of
members in the V Sge class is still small. In order to find new members we
selected QU Car for photometric and spectroscopic observations. The orbital
period of this system was published in the literature as 10.9 h, determined
from radial velocity data taken in 1979-1980, but posterior analysis of data
taken in 2006-2007 did not confirm this period. We analysed the high
variability of its emission line profiles with the Temporal Variance Spectrum
(TVS) technique. Besides, we recovered the 10.9 h orbital period from the
radial velocities of the He II 4686 A emission line and, for the first time,
detected what may be the orbital modulation in the photometric data. This
photometric modulation is present only in the lower brightness state data, when
the flickering is attenuated. The inclusion of QU Car in the V Sge class is
supported by many features like high/low states, strong winds, nebular lines
and He II 4686 A/Hbeta line ratios. However, the non-detection of the
characteristic O VI 3811-34 A lines in its spectrum claims against this
classification. These lines, though, may be highly variable so additional
spectra analysed with the TVS technique can, possibly, solve this question.
