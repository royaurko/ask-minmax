In this paper, a new approach of defining Steiner symmetrization of coercive
convex functions is proposed and some fundamental properties of the new Steiner
symmetrization are proved. Further, using the new Steiner symmetrization, we
give a different approach to prove a functional version of the Blaschke-Santalo
inequality due to Ball.
