The linear potential binding a quark and an antiquark in mesons is
generalized to baryons and multiquark configurations as the minimal length of
flux tubes neutralizing the color, in units of the string tension. For
tetraquark systems, i.e., two quarks and two antiquarks, this involves the two
possible quark--antiquark pairings, and the Steiner tree linking the quarks to
the antiquarks. A novel inequality for this potential demonstrates rigorously
that within this model the tetraquark is stable in the limit of large
quark-to-antiquark mass ratio.
