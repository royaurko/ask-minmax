We study the insulating phase of disordered indium oxide films that undergo a
field-tuned superconductor-insulator transition. The transport measurements in
a perpendicular magnetic field show distinct regimes of strongly fluctuating
order-parameter amplitude and phase, and reveal a wide range of insulator
strength in samples with differing disorder, despite the similarity in behavior
near the SIT. We characterize the strength of the insulating phase and compare
it to the superconducting strength. We find that the films do not return to the
expected normal state even at high perpendicular magnetic fields where all
pairs should be broken, suggesting the remaining presence of superconductivity
at high fields.
