This posting announces public availability of the GALAXY software package
developed by the contributor over the past 40 years. It is a highly efficient code
for the evolution of (almost) isolated, collisionless stellar systems, both
disk-like and ellipsoidal. In addition to the N-body code galaxy, which offers
eleven different methods to compute the gravitational accelerations, the
package also includes sophisticated set-up and analysis software. This paper
gives an outline of the contents of the package and provides links to the
source code and a comprehensive on-line manual. While not as versatile as tree
codes, the particle-mesh methods in this package are shown, for certain
restricted applications, to be between 50 and 200 times faster than a
widely-used tree code.
