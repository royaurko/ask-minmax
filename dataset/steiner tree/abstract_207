A stability version of the Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality and the affine
isoperimetric inequality for convex bodies of dimension n>2 is proved. The
first step is the reduction to the case when the convex body is o-symmetric and
has axial rotational symmetry. This step works for related inequalities
compatible with Steiner symmetrization. Secondly, for these convex bodies, a
stability version of the characterization of ellipsoids by the fact that each
hyperplane section is centrally symmetric is established.
