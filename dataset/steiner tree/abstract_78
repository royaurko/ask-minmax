We study the location and the size of the roots of Steiner polynomials of
convex bodies in the Minkowski relative geometry. Based on a problem of
Teissier on the intersection numbers of Cartier divisors of compact algebraic
varieties it was conjectured that these roots have certain geometric properties
related to the in- and circumradius of the convex body. We show that the roots
of 1-tangential bodies fulfill the conjecture, but we also present convex
bodies violating each of the conjectured properties.
