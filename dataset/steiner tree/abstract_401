We introduce equivariant tree models in algebraic statistics, which unify and
generalise existing tree models such as the general Markov model, the strand
symmetric model, and group based models. We focus on the ideals of such models.
We show how the ideals for general trees can be determined from the ideals for
stars. The main novelty is our proof that this procedure yields the entire
ideal, not just an ideal defining the model set-theoretically. A corollary of
theoretical importance is that the ideal for a general tree is generated by the
ideals of its flattenings at vertices.
