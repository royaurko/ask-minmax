Let $X$ be a fuzzy set--valued random variable (\frv{}), and $\huku{X}$ the
family of all fuzzy sets $B$ for which the Hukuhara difference $X\HukuDiff B$
exists $\mathbb{P}$--almost surely. In this paper, we prove that $X$ can be
decomposed as $X(\omega)=C\Mink Y(\omega)$ for $\mathbb{P}$--almost every
$\omega\in\Omega$, $C$ is the unique deterministic fuzzy set that minimizes
$\mathbb{E}[d_2(X,B)^2]$ as $B$ is varying in $\huku{X}$, and $Y$ is a centered
\frv{} (i.e. its generalized Steiner point is the origin). This decomposition
allows us to characterize all \frv{} translation (i.e. $X(\omega) = M \Mink
\indicator{\xi(\omega)}$ for some deterministic fuzzy convex set $M$ and some
random element in $\Banach$). In particular, $X$ is an \frv{} translation if
and only if the Aumann expectation $\mathbb{E}X$ is equal to $C$ up to a
translation.
  Examples, such as the Gaussian case, are provided.
