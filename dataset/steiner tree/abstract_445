A plasma glow discharge system was created using a conventional microwave
oven to ignite and maintain the plasma. The system was used for plasma cleaning
and its properties were analysed to assess its viability for removing surface
contaminants, which cause anomalous heating, from Paul trap electrodes used in
ion trapping. Qualitative results showed that the argon plasma could remove
copper oxide layers formed on thin sheets in 1-2 minutes. The addition of air
into the plasma system allowed for the cleaning of more complex hydrocarbon
contaminants, as highlighted by the removal of permanent marker pen. The
surface removal rate of the system was evaluated by measuring the time taken to
remove gold plating from washers and aluminium plates. A nominal rate of 5-15
nm per min was found under optimal conditions. Plasma treatment, in addition to
wet chemical cleaning, was found to increase the finesse of an optical cavity
by a factor of two, compared to acetone cleaning alone. These results are
promising for the system's in-situ use on Paul trap electrodes and could be a
feasible technique for increasing their lifetime.
