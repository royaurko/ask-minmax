We introduce a general approach to prove oracle properties in context tree
selection. The results derive from a concentration condition that is verified,
for example, by mixing processes. Moreover, we show the superiority of the
oracle approach from a non-asymptotic point of view in simulations where the
classical BIC estimator has nice oracle properties even when it does not
recover the source.
  Our second objective is to extend the slope algorithm of \cite{AM08} to
context tree estimation. The algorithm gives a practical way to evaluate the
leading constant in front of the penalties. We study the slope heuristic
underlying this algorithm and obtain the first results on the slope phenomenon
in a discrete, non i.i.d framework. We illustrate in simulations the
improvement of the oracle properties of BIC estimators by the slope algorithm.
