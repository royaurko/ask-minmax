In this experimental study we consider Steiner tree approximations that
guarantee a constant approximation of ratio less than $2$. The considered
greedy algorithms and approaches based on linear programming involve the
incorporation of $k$-restricted full components for some $k \geq 3$. For most
of the algorithms, their strongest theoretical approximation bounds are only
achieved for $k \to \infty$. However, the running time is also exponentially
dependent on $k$, so only small $k$ are tractable in practice.
  We investigate different implementation aspects and parameter choices that
finally allow us to construct algorithms (somewhat) feasible for practical use.
We compare the algorithms against each other, to an exact LP-based algorithm,
and to fast and simple $2$-approximations.
