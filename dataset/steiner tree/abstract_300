V617 Sgr is a V Sagittae star - a group of binaries thought to be the
galactic counterparts of the Compact Binary Supersoft X-ray Sources - CBSS. To
check this hypothesis, we measured the time derivative of its orbital period.
Observed timings of eclipse minima spanning over 30,000 orbital cycles are
presented. We found that the orbital period evolves quite rapidly: P/Pdot = 1.1
x 10^{6} years. This is consistent with the idea that V617 Sgr is a wind driven
accretion supersoft source. As the binary system evolves with a time-scale of
about one million years, which is extremely short for a low mass evolved
binary, it is likely that the system will soon end either by having its
secondary completely evaporated or by the primary exploding as a supernova of
type Ia.
