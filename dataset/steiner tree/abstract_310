We reexamine the surface composition of strange stars. Strange quark stars
are hypothetical compact stars which could exist if strange quark matter was
absolutely stable. It is widely accepted that they are characterized by an
enormous density gradient ($~10^{26}$ g/cm$^4$) and large electric fields at
surface. By investigating the possibility of realizing a heterogeneous crust,
comprised of nuggets of strange quark matter embedded in an uniform electron
background, we find that the strange star surface has a much reduced density
gradient and negligible electric field. We comment on how our findings will
impact various proposed observable signatures for strange stars.
