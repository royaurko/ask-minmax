In our proceeding paper a generating set of the derived Picard group of a
selfinjective Nakayama algebra was constructed combining some previous results
for Brauer tree algebras and the technique of orbit categories developed there.
In this paper we finish the computation of the derived Picard group of a
selfinjective Nakayama algebra.
