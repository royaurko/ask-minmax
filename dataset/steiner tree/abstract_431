Context. Close binary supersoft X-ray sources (CBSS) are binary systems that
contain a white dwarf with stable nuclear burning on its surface. These
sources, first discovered in the Magellanic Clouds, have high accretion rates
and near-Eddington luminosities (10^37 - 10^38 erg/s) with high temperatures (T
= 2 - 7 x 10^5 K). Aims. The total number of known objects in the MC is still
small and, in our galaxy, even smaller. We observed the field of the
unidentified transient supersoft X-ray source RX J0527.8-6954 in order to
identify its optical counterpart. Methods. The observation was made with the
IFU-GMOS on the Gemini South telescope with the purpose of identifying stars
with possible He II or Balmer emission or else of observing nebular extended
jets or ionization cones, features that may be expected in CBSS. Results. The
X-ray source is identified with a B5e V star that is associated with
subarcsecond extended Halpha emission, possibly bipolar. Conclusions. If the
primary star is a white dwarf, as suggested by the supersoft X-ray spectrum,
the expected orbital period exceeds 21 h; therefore, we believe that the 9.4 h
period found so far is not associated to this system.
