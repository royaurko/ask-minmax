We introduce the notion of an oriented Steiner quasigroup and develop
elements of a relevant algebraic apparatus. The approach is based upon
(modified) Schreier-type $f$-extensions for quasigroups (cf. earlier works
\cite{S, NSt, NSt2}) achieved through oriented Steiner triple systems. This is
done in a fashion similar to in \cite{SS} where an analogous construction was
established for loops. As a justification of this concept briefly discuss an
application of oriented Steiner triple systems in cryptography using oriented
Steiner quasigroups.
