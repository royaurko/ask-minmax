Motivated as a null model for comparison with data, we study the following
model for a phylogenetic tree on $n$ extant species. The origin of the clade is
a random time in the past, whose (improper) distribution is uniform on
$(0,\infty)$. After that origin, the process of extinctions and speciations is
a continuous-time critical branching process of constant rate, conditioned on
having the prescribed number $n$ of species at the present time. We study
various mathematical properties of this model as $n \to \infty$ limits: time of
origin and of most recent common ancestor; pattern of divergence times within
lineage trees; time series of numbers of species; number of extinct species in
total, or ancestral to extant species; and "local" structure of the tree
itself. We emphasize several mathematical techniques: associating walks with
trees, a point process representation of lineage trees, and Brownian limits.
