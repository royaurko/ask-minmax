We present first results from three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of M-type dwarf stars with CO5BOLD. The local models include the
top of the convection zone, the photosphere, and the chromosphere. The results
are illustrated for models with an effective temperature of 3240 K and a
gravitational acceleration of log g = 4.5, which represent analogues of AD Leo.
The models have different initial magnetic field strengths and field
topologies. This first generation of models demonstrates that the atmospheres
of M-dwarfs are highly dynamic and intermittent. Magnetic fields and
propagating shock waves produce a complicated fine-structure, which is clearly
visible in synthetic intensity maps in the core of the Ca II K spectral line
and also at millimeter wavelengths. The dynamic small-scale pattern cannot be
described by means of one-dimensional models, which has important implications
for the construction of semi-empirical model atmospheres and thus for the
interpretation of observations in general. Detailed three-dimensional numerical
simulations are valuable in this respect. Furthermore, such models facilitate
the analysis of small-scale processes, which cannot be observed on stars but
nevertheless might be essential for understanding M-dwarf atmospheres and their
activity. An example are so-called "magnetic tornadoes", which have recently
been found on the Sun and are presented here in M-dwarf models for the first
time.
