Place value numbers, such as the binary or decimal numbers can be represented
by the end vertices (leaf or pendant vertices) of rooted symmetrical trees.
Numbers that consist of at most a fixed number of digits are represented by
vertices that are equidistant from the root vertex and the corresponding number
representations do not depend on the distance from the root vertex. In this
paper, we introduce place value number systems which are representable by
rooted symmetrical trees and in which the representation of a number depends on
the distance of the corresponding vertex from the root vertex. Such dependence
activates the role of zero in such a way as to render its function equivalent
to that of any other single digit number. Thus, in addition to being a place
value holder, the digit zero (just as any other single digit numeral) affects
the value of a number regardless of its position. For example 012 is different,
in the new systems, from 12. As such, these new number systems could be thought
of as a natural development for the role of zero. We also illustrate how
addition is performed in these newly constructed number systems. In addition to
being mathematical structures which could be of mathematical interest, these
new number systems could possibly have applications in computing and computing
security.
