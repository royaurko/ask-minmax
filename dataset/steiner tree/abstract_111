The Hilbert scheme of n points in the projective plane parameterizes degree n
zero-dimensional subschemes of the projective plane. We examine the dual cones
of effective divisors and moving curves on the Hilbert scheme. By studying
interpolation, restriction, and stability properties of certain vector bundles
on the plane we fully determine these cones for just over three fourths of all
values of n.
  A general Steiner bundle on P^N is a vector bundle admitting a linear
resolution of a particular form. We complete the classification of slopes of
semistable Steiner bundles on P^N by showing every admissible slope is realized
by a bundle which restricts to a semistable bundle on a rational curve. The
proof involves a basic question about multiplication of polynomials on P^1
which is interesting in its own right.
