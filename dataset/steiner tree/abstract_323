The Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN
includes a silicon pixel detector as its innermost component. Its main task is
the precise reconstruction of charged particles close to the primary
interaction vertex. This paper gives an overview of the mechanical requirements
and design choices for the barrel pixel detector. The distribution of material
in the detector as well as its description in the Monte Carlo simulation are
discussed in detail.
