We use a generalization of Horrocks monads for arithmetic Cohen-Macaulay
(ACM) varieties to establish a cohomological characterization of linear and
Steiner bundles over projective spaces and quadric hypersurfaces. We also study
resolutions of bundles on ACM varieties by line bundles, and characterize
linear homological dimension in the case of quadric hypersurfaces.
