Random tensor models for a generic complex tensor generalize matrix models in
arbitrary dimensions and yield a theory of random geometries. They support a
1/N expansion dominated by graphs of spherical topology. Their Schwinger Dyson
equations, generalizing the loop equations of matrix models, translate into
constraints satisfied by the partition function. The constraints have been
shown, in the large N limit, to close a Lie algebra indexed by colored rooted
D-ary trees yielding a first generalization of the Virasoro algebra in
arbitrary dimensions. In this paper we complete the Schwinger Dyson equations
and the associated algebra at all orders in 1/N. The full algebra of
constraints is indexed by D-colored graphs, and the leading order D-ary tree
algebra is a Lie subalgebra of the full constraints algebra.
