In this two part paper we consider a wireless network in which a source
terminal communicates with a destination and a relay terminal is occasionally
present in close proximity to the source without source's knowledge, suggesting
oblivious protocols. The source-relay channel is assumed to be a fixed gain
AWGN due to the proximity while the source-destination and the
relay-destination channels are subject to a block flat Rayleigh fading. A
perfect CSI at the respective receivers only is assumed. With the average
throughput as a performance measure, we incorporate a two-layer broadcast
approach into two cooperative strategies based on the decode-and-forward scheme
- Sequential Decoded-and Forward (SDF) in part I and the Block-Markov (BM) in
part II. The broadcast approach splits the transmitted rate into superimposed
layers corresponding to a "bad" and a "good" channel states, allowing better
adaptation to the actual channel conditions In part I, the achievable rate
expressions for the SDF strategy are derived under the broadcast approach for
multiple settings including single user, MISO and the general relay setting
using successive decoding technique, both numerically and analytically.
Continuous broadcasting lower bounds are derived for the MISO and an oblivious
cooperation scenarios.
