We report a measurement of the neutrino-electron elastic scattering rate from
8B solar neutrinos based on a 123 kton-day exposure of KamLAND. The
background-subtracted electron recoil rate, above a 5.5 MeV analysis threshold
is 1.49+/-0.14(stat)+/-0.17(syst) events per kton-day. Interpreted as due to a
pure electron flavor flux with a 8B neutrino spectrum, this corresponds to a
spectrum integrated flux of 2.77+/-0.26(stat)+/-0.32(syst) x 10^6 cm^-2s^-1.
The analysis threshold is driven by 208Tl present in the liquid scintillator,
and the main source of systematic uncertainty is due to background from
cosmogenic 11Be. The measured rate is consistent with existing measurements and
with Standard Solar Model predictions which include matter enhanced neutrino
oscillation.
