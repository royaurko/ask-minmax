In this paper, we develop a multigrid method on unstructured shape-regular
grids. For a general shape-regular unstructured grid of ${\cal O}(N)$ elements,
we present a construction of an auxiliary coarse grid hierarchy on which a
geometric multigrid method can be applied together with a smoothing on the
original grid by using the auxiliary space preconditioning technique. Such a
construction is realized by a cluster tree which can be obtained in ${\cal
O}(N\log N)$ operations for a grid of $N$ elements. This tree structure in turn
is used for the definition of the grid hierarchy from coarse to fine. For the
constructed grid hierarchy we prove that the convergence rate of the multigrid
preconditioned CG for an elliptic PDE is $1 - {\cal O}({1}/{\log N})$.
Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical bounds and show that the total
complexity is in ${\cal O}(N\log N)$.
