A Heffter array is an m by n matrix with nonzero entries from Z_{2mn+1} such
that i) every row and column sum to 0, and ii) no element from {x,-x} appears
twice. We construct some Heffter arrays. These arrays are used to build current
graphs used in topological graph theory. In turn, the current graphs are used
to embed the complete graph K_{2mn+1} so that the faces can be 2-colored,
called a biembedding. Under certain conditions each color class forms a cycle
system. These generalize biembeddings of Steiner triple systems. We discuss
some variations including Heffter arrays with empty cells, embeddings on
nonorientable surfaces, complete multigraphs, and using integer in place of
modular arithmetic.
