Cameron and Kazanidis have recently shown that rank-3 graphs are either cores
or have complete cores, and they asked whether this holds for all strongly
regular graphs. We prove that this is true for the point graphs and line graphs
of generalized quadrangles and that when the number of points is sufficiently
large, it is also true for the block graphs of Steiner systems and orthogonal
arrays.
