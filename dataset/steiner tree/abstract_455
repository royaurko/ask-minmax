The hadron-quark phase transition in the core of massive neutron stars is
studied with a newly constructed two-phase model. For nuclear matter, a
nonlinear Walecka type model with general nucleon-meson and meson-meson
couplings, recently calibrated by Steiner, Hemper and Fischer, is taken. For
quark matter, a modified Polyakov-Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (mPNJL) model, which
gives consistent results with lattice QCD data, is used. Most importantly, we
introduce an isoscalar-vector interaction in the description of quark matter,
and we study its influence on the hadron-quark phase transition in the interior
of massive neutron stars. With the constraints of neutron star observations,
our calculation shows that the isoscalar-vector interaction between quarks is
indispensable if massive hybrids star exist in the universe, and its strength
determines the onset density of quark matter, as well as the mass-radius
relations of hybrid stars. Furthermore, as a connection with
heavy-ion-collision experiments we give some discussions about the strength of
isoscalar-vector interaction and its effect on the signals of hadron-quark
phase transition in heavy-ion collisions, in the energy range of the NICA at
JINR-Dubna and FAIR at GSI-Darmstadt facilities.
