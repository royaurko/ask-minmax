We present experimental evidence for scale invariant behaviour of the
excitation spectrum in phase-fluctuating quasi-1d Bose gases after a rapid
change of the external trapping potential. Probing density correlations in free
expansion, we find that the temperature of an initial thermal state scales with
the spatial extension of the cloud as predicted by a model based on adiabatic
rescaling of initial eigenmodes with conserved quasiparticle occupation
numbers. Based on this result, we demonstrate that shortcuts to adiabaticity
for the rapid expansion or compression of the gas do not induce additional
heating.
