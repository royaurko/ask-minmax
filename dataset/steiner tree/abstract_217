We study translation invariant, real-valued valuations on the class of convex
polytopes in Euclidean space and discuss which continuity properties are
sufficient for an extension of such valuations to all convex bodies. For this
purpose, we introduce flag support measures of convex bodies via a local
Steiner formula and derive some of the properties of these measures.
