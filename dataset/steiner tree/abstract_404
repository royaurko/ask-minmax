In this paper we prove the equiconsistency of ``Every omega_1 tree which is
first order definable over H_{omega_1} has a cofinal branch'' with the
existence of a Pi^1_1 reflecting cardinal. The proof uses a definable version
of Ramsey theorem on aleph_1 which is again equiconsistent with a Pi^1_1
reflecting cardinal. We also prove that the addition of $MA$ to the definable
tree property increases the consistency strength to that of a weakly compact
cardinal. Finally we comment on the generalization to higher cardinals.
