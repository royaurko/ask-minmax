To learn the multi-class conceptions from the electroencephalogram (EEG) data
we developed a neural network decision tree (DT), that performs the linear
tests, and a new training algorithm. We found that the known methods fail
inducting the classification models when the data are presented by the features
some of them are irrelevant, and the classes are heavily overlapped. To train
the DT, our algorithm exploits a bottom up search of the features that provide
the best classification accuracy of the linear tests. We applied the developed
algorithm to induce the DT from the large EEG dataset consisted of 65 patients
belonging to 16 age groups. In these recordings each EEG segment was
represented by 72 calculated features. The DT correctly classified 80.8% of the
training and 80.1% of the testing examples. Correspondingly it correctly
classified 89.2% and 87.7% of the EEG recordings.
