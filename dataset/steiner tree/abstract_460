Although it is well known that massive galaxies have central black holes,
most of them accreting at low Eddington ratios, many important questions still
remain open. Among them, are the nature of the ionizing source, the
characteristics and frequencies of the broad line region and of the dusty
torus. We report observations of 10 early-type galactic nuclei, observed with
the IFU/GMOS spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope, analysed with standard
techniques for spectral treatment and compared with results obtained with
principal component analysis Tomography (Paper I). We performed spectral
synthesis of each spaxel of the data cubes and subtracted the stellar component
from the original cube, leaving a data cube with emission lines only. The
emission lines were decomposed in multi-Gaussian components. We show here that,
for eight galaxies previously known to have emission lines, the narrow line
region can be decomposed in two components with distinct line widths. In
addition to this, broad H$\alpha$ emission was detected in six galaxies. The
two galaxies not previously known to have emission lines show weak H$\alpha$+[N
II] lines. All 10 galaxies may be classified as low-ionization nuclear emission
regions in diagnostic diagrams and seven of them have bona fide active galactic
nuclei with luminosities between 10$^{40}$ and 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
Eddington ratios are always < 10$^{-3}$.
