In this paper we consider the problem of efficiently constructing in a fully
distributed manner multicast trees which are embedded into P2P overlays using
virtual geometric node coordinates. We consider two objectives: to minimize the
number of messages required for constructing a multicast tree by using the
geometric properties of the P2P overlay, and to construct stable multicast
trees when the lifetime durations of the peers are known.
