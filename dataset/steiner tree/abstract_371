To avoid reflectivity losses in ITER optical diagnostic systems, plasma
sputtering of metallic First Mirrors is foreseen in order to remove deposits
coming from the main wall (mainly beryllium and tungsten). Therefore plasma
cleaning has to work on large mirrors (up to a size of 200*300 mm) and under
the influence of strong magnetic fields (several Tesla). This work presents the
results of plasma cleaning of aluminium and aluminium oxide (used as beryllium
proxy) deposited on molybdenum mirrors. Using radio frequency (13.56 MHz) argon
plasma, the removal of a 260 nm mixed aluminium/aluminium oxide film deposited
by magnetron sputtering on a mirror (98 mm diameter) was demonstrated. 50 nm of
pure aluminium oxide were removed from test mirrors (25 mm diameter) in a
magnetic field of 0.35 T for various angles between the field lines and the
mirrors surfaces. The cleaning efficiency was evaluated by performing
reflectivity measurements, Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy.
