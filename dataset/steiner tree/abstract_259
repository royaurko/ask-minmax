We perform a systematic assessment of models for the equation of state (EOS)
of dense matter in the context of recent neutron star mass and radius
measurements to obtain a broad picture of the structure of neutron stars. We
demonstrate that currently available neutron star mass and radius measurements
provide strong constraints on moments of inertia, tidal deformabilities, and
crust thicknesses. A measurement of the moment of inertia of PSR J0737-3039A
with 10% error, without any other information from observations, will constrain
the EOS over a range of densities to within 50%$-$60%. We find tidal
deformabilities between 0.6 and $6\times 10^{36}$ g cm$^{2}$ s$^{2}$ (to 95%
confidence) for $M=1.4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and any measurement which
constrains this range will provide an important constraint on dense matter. The
crustal fraction of the moment of inertia can be as large as 10% for
$M=1.4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ permitting crusts to have a large enough moment of
inertia reservoir to explain glitches in the Vela pulsar even with a large
amount of superfluid entrainment. Finally, due to the uncertainty in the
equation of state, there is at least a 40% variation in the thickness of the
crust for a fixed mass and radius, which implies that future simulations of the
cooling of a neutron star crust which has been heated by accretion will need to
take this variation into account.
