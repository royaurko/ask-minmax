We report on the measurement of the charged kaon correlation functions $k_T$
dependencies using 600 GeV/$c$ $\Sigma^-$, $\pi^-$ and 540 GeV/$c$ $p$ beams
from the SELEX (E781) experiment at Tevatron. One-dimentional $K^{ch}K^{ch}$
correlation functions are constructed in three transverse momentum ranges. The
emission source parameters $\lambda$ and $R$ are extracted. The analysis shows
a decrease of the source radii with the kaon pair transverse momentum for all
beam types
