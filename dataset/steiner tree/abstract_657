In this short note we prove that the projective dimension of a sequentially
Cohen-Macaulay square-free monomial ideal is equal to the maximal height of its
minimal primes (also known as the big height), or equivalently, the maximal
cardinality of a minimal vertex cover of its facet complex. This in particular
gives a formula for the projective dimension of facet ideals of these classes
of ideals, which are known to be sequentially Cohen-Macaulay: graph trees and
simplicial trees, chordal graphs and some cycles, chordal clutters and graphs,
and some path ideals to mention a few. Since polarization preserves projective
dimension, our result also gives the projective dimension of any sequentially
Cohen-Macaulay monomial ideal.
