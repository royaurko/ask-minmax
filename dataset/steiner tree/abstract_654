We study a directed polymer model in a random environment on infinite binary
trees. The model is characterized by a phase transition depending on the
inverse temperature. We concentrate on the asymptotics of the partition
function in the near-critical regime, where the inverse temperature is a small
perturbation away from the critical one with the perturbation converging to
zero as the system size grows large. Depending on the speed of convergence we
observe very different asymptotic behavior. If the perturbation is small then
we are inside the critical window and observe the same decay of the partition
function as at the critical temperature. If the perturbation is slightly larger
the near-critical scaling leads to a new range of asymptotic behaviors, which
at the extremes match up with the already known rates for the sub- and
super-critical regimes. We use our results to identify the size of the
fluctuations of the typical energies under the critical Gibbs measure.
