Background:
  Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a well established method for qualitative as
well as probabilistic reliability and safety analysis. As a Boolean model it
does not support modelling of dynamic effects like sequence dependencies
between fault events. This work describes a method that allows consideration of
sequence dependencies without transformations into state-space.
  Concept:
  The new temporal fault tree analysis (TFTA) described in this work extends
the Boolean FTA. The TFTA is based on a new temporal logic which adds a concept
of time to the Boolean logic and algebra. This allows modelling of temporal
relationships between events using two new temporal operators (PAND and SAND).
With a set of temporal logic rules, a given temporal term may be simplified to
its temporal disjunctive normal form (TDNF) which is similar to the Boolean DNF
but includes event sequencies. In TDNF the top event's temporal system function
may be reduced to a list of minimal cutset sequences (MCSS). These allow
qualitative analyses similar to Boolean cutset analysis in normal FTA.
Furthermore the TFTA may also be used for probabilistic analyses without using
state-space models.
  Results:
  One significant aspect of the new TFTA described in this work is the
possibility to take sequence dependencies into account for qualitative and
probabilistic analyses without state-space transformations. Among others, this
allows for modelling of event sequencies at all levels within a fault tree, a
real qualitative analysis similar to the FTA's cutset analysis, and
quantification of sequence dependencies within the same model.
