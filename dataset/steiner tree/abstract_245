We determine an empirical dense matter equation of state from a heterogeneous
dataset of six neutron stars: three type I X-ray bursters with photospheric
radius expansion, studied by Ozel et al., and three transient low-mass X-ray
binaries. We critically assess the mass and radius determinations from the
X-ray burst sources and show explicitly how systematic uncertainties, such as
the photospheric radius at touchdown, affect the most probable masses and
radii. We introduce a parameterized equation of state and use a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo algorithm within a Bayesian framework to determine nuclear
parameters such as the incompressibility and the density dependence of the bulk
symmetry energy. Using this framework we show, for the first time, that these
parameters, predicted solely on the basis of astrophysical observations, all
lie in ranges expected from nuclear systematics and laboratory experiments. We
find significant constraints on the mass-radius relation for neutron stars, and
hence on the pressure-density relation of dense matter. The predicted symmetry
energy and the equation of state near the saturation density are soft,
resulting in relatively small neutron star radii around 11-12 km for M=1.4
Msun. The predicted equation of state stiffens at higher densities, however,
and our preferred model for X-ray bursts suggests that the neutron star maximum
mass is relatively large, 1.9-2.2 Msun. Our results imply that several commonly
used equations of state are inconsistent with observations.
