Based on the recently proposed Roy-Steiner equations for pion-nucleon
scattering, we derive a system of coupled integral equations for the pi pi -->
N-bar N and K-bar K --> N-bar N S-waves. These equations take the form of a
two-channel Muskhelishvili-Omnes problem, whose solution in the presence of a
finite matching point is discussed. We use these results to update the
dispersive analysis of the scalar form factor of the nucleon fully including
K-bar K intermediate states. In particular, we determine the correction
Delta_sigma=sigma(2M_pi^2)-sigma_{pi N}, which is needed for the extraction of
the pion-nucleon sigma term from pi N scattering, as a function of pion-nucleon
subthreshold parameters and the pi N coupling constant.
