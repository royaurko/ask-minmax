A complete classification of the perfect binary one-error-correcting codes of
length 15 as well as their extensions of length 16 is presented. There are 5983
such inequivalent perfect codes and 2165 extended perfect codes. Efficient
generation of these codes relies on the recent classification of Steiner
quadruple systems of order 16. Utilizing a result of Blackmore, the optimal
binary one-error-correcting codes of length 14 and the (15, 1024, 4) codes are
also classified; there are 38408 and 5983 such codes, respectively.
