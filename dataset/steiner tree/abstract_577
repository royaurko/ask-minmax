Effective tree Chiral Lagrangian is interpreted as a power series expansion
of the kinematical variables. In the presence of the strong interaction this
expansion is valid below the unitarity cut, hence in the unphysical region.
 Consequences of this reinterpretation of the Chiral Lagrangian are analysed
for the relation between K-pi and K-pipi transitions.
