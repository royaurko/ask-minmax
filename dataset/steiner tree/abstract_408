Each labeled rooted tree is associated with a hyperplane arrangement, which
is free with exponents given by the depths of the vertices of this tree. The
intersection lattices of these arrangements are described through posets of
forests. These posets are used to define coalgebras, whose dual algebras are
shown to have a simple presentation by generators and relations.
