We give a randomized O(n polylog n)-time approximation scheme for the Steiner
forest problem in the Euclidean plane. For every fixed eps > 0 and given n
terminals in the plane with connection requests between some pairs of
terminals, our scheme finds a (1 + eps)-approximation to the minimum-length
forest that connects every requested pair of terminals.
