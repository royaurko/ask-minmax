The $q$-Fano plane is the $q$-analog of the Steiner system $S(2,3,7)$. For
any given prime power $q$ it is not known whether the $q$-Fano plane exists or
not. We consider the structure of the $q$-Fano plane for any given $q$ and
conclude that most of its structure is known. Even so, we were unable to
determine whether it exists or not. A special attention is given for the case
$q=2$ which was considered by most researchers before.
