In this paper we study binary trees with choosable edge lengths, in
particular rooted binary trees with the property that the two edges leading
from every non-leaf to its two children are assigned integral lengths $l_1$ and
$l_2$ with $l_1+l_2 =k$ for a constant $k\in\mathbb{N}$. The depth of a leaf is
the total length of the edges of the unique root-leaf-path.
  We present a generalization of the Huffman Coding that can decide in
polynomial time if for given values $d_1,\ldots,d_n\in\mathbb{N}_{\geq 0}$
there exists a rooted binary tree with choosable edge lengths with $n$ leaves
having depths at most $d_1,\ldots ,d_n$.
