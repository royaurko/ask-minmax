We study tree languages that can be defined in \Delta_2 . These are tree
languages definable by a first-order formula whose quantifier prefix is forall
exists, and simultaneously by a first-order formula whose quantifier prefix is
. For the quantifier free part we consider two signatures, either the
descendant relation alone or together with the lexicographical order relation
on nodes. We provide an effective characterization of tree and forest languages
definable in \Delta_2 . This characterization is in terms of algebraic
equations. Over words, the class of word languages definable in \Delta_2 forms
a robust class, which was given an effective algebraic characterization by Pin
and Weil.
