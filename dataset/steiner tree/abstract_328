Graphene is a 2-dimensional material with high carrier mobility and thermal
conductivity, suitable for high-speed electronics. Conduction and valence bands
touch at the Dirac point. The absorptivity of single-layer graphene is 2.3%,
nearly independent of wavelength. Here we investigate the thermal radiation
from biased graphene transistors. We find that the emission spectrum of
single-layer graphene follows that of a grey body with constant emissivity (1.6
\pm 0.8)%. Most importantly, we can extract the temperature distribution in the
ambipolar graphene channel, as confirmed by Stokes/anti-Stokes measurements.
The biased graphene exhibits a temperature maximum whose location can be
controlled by the gate voltage. We show that this peak in temperature reveals
the spatial location of the minimum in carrier density, i.e. the Dirac point.
