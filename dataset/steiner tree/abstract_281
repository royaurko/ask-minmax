New representations of tree-structured data objects, using ideas from
topological data analysis, enable improved statistical analyses of a population
of brain artery trees. A number of representations of each data tree arise from
persistence diagrams that quantify branching and looping of vessels at multiple
scales. Novel approaches to the statistical analysis, through various summaries
of the persistence diagrams, lead to heightened correlations with covariates
such as age and sex, relative to earlier analyses of this data set. The
correlation with age continues to be significant even after controlling for
correlations from earlier significant summaries
