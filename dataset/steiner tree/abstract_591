We introduce the modular Catalan number $C_{n,k}$ which enumerates distinct
functions obtained by parenthesizing $x_1*\cdots*x_{n+1}$, where
$a*b:=a+e^{2\pi i/k}\,b$. We find restricted families of binary trees and other
Catalan objects that are enumerated by $C_{n,k}$. We give a closed formula for
$C_{n,k}$ and show that its generating function satisfies a degree $k$
polynomial equation.
