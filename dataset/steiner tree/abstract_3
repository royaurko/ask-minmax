We present the first non-trivial online algorithms for the non-uniform,
multicommodity buy-at-bulk (MC-BB) network design problem in undirected and
directed graphs. Our competitive ratios qualitatively match the best known
approximation factors for the corresponding offline problems. The main engine
for our results is an online reduction theorem of MC-BB problems to their
single-sink (SS-BB) counterparts. We use the concept of junction-tree solutions
(Chekuri et al., FOCS 2006) that play an important role in solving the offline
versions of the problem via a greedy subroutine -- an inherently offline
procedure. Our main technical contribution is in designing an online algorithm
using only the existence of good junction-trees to reduce an MC-BB instance to
multiple SS-BB sub-instances. Along the way, we also give the first non-trivial
online node-weighted/directed single-sink buy-at-bulk algorithms. In addition
to the new results, our generic reduction also yields new proofs of recent
results for the online node-weighted Steiner forest and online group Steiner
forest problems.
