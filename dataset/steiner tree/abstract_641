We calculate form factors of half-BPS operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills
theory at tree level and one loop using novel applications of recursion
relations and unitarity. In particular, we determine the expression of the
one-loop form factors with two scalars and an arbitrary number of
positive-helicity gluons. These quantities resemble closely the MHV scattering
amplitudes, including holomorphicity of the tree-level form factor, and the
expansion in terms of two-mass easy box functions of the one-loop result. Next,
we compare our result for these form factors to the calculation of a particular
periodic Wilson loop at one loop, finding agreement. This suggests a novel
duality relating form factors to periodic Wilson loops.
