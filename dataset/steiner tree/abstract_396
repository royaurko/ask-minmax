On a locally finite point set, a navigation defines a path through the point
set from one point to another. The set of paths leading to a given point
defines a tree known as the navigation tree. In this article, we analyze the
properties of the navigation tree when the point set is a Poisson point process
on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We examine the local weak convergence of the navigation
tree, the asymptotic average of a functional along a path, the shape of the
navigation tree and its topological ends. We illustrate our work in the
small-world graphs where new results are established.
