Empirical observations suggest that in pure even-aged forests, the mean
diameter of forest trees (D, diameter at breast height, 1.3 m above ground)
tends to remain a constant proportion of stand height (H, average height of the
largest trees in a stand) divided by the logarithm of stand density (N, number
of trees per hectare): D = beta (H-1.3)/Ln(N). Thinning causes a relatively
small and temporary change in the slope beta, the magnitude and duration of
which depends on the nature of the thinning. This relationship may provide a
robust predictor of growth in situations where scarce data and resources
preclude more sophisticated modelling approaches.
