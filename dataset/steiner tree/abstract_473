We analyze simultaneously six composite RXTE spectra of GX~339-4 in the hard
state comprising 77 million counts collected over 196 ks.The source spectra are
ordered by luminosity and span the range 1.6% to 17% of the Eddington
luminosity. Crucially, using our new tool PCACORR, we re-calibrate the data to
a precision of 0.1%, an order of magnitude improvement over all earlier work.
Using our advanced reflection model RELXILL, we target the strong features in
the component of emission reflected from the disk, namely, the
relativistically-broadened Fe K emission line, the Fe K edge and the Compton
hump. We report results for two joint fits to the six spectra: For the first
fit, we fix the spin parameter to its maximal value ($a_*=0.998$) and allow the
inner disk radius $R_{in}$ to vary. Results include (i) precise measurements of
$R_{in}$, with evidence that the disk becomes slightly truncated at a few
percent of Eddington; and (ii) an order-of-magnitude swing with luminosity in
the high energy cutoff, which reaches >890 keV at our lowest luminosity. For
the second fit, implementing the standard assumption of $R_{in} = R_{ISCO}$, we
estimate the spin parameter to be $a_* = 0.95^{+0.03}_{-0.05}$ (90% confidence,
statistical). For both fits, and at the same level of statistical confidence,
we estimate that the disk inclination is $i = 48 \pm 1$ deg and that the Fe
abundance is super-solar, $A_{Fe} = 5 \pm 1$.
