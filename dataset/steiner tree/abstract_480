Tree level gauge mediation (TGM) may be considered as the simplest way to
communicate supersymmetry breaking: through the tree level renormalizable
exchange of heavy gauge messengers. We study its general structure, in
particular the general form of tree level sfermion masses and of one loop, but
enhanced, gaugino masses. This allows us to set up general guidelines for model
building and to identify the hypotheses underlying the phenomenological
predictions. In the context of models based on the "minimal" gauge group
SO(10), we show that only two "pure" embeddings of the MSSM fields are possible
using $d< 120$ representations, each of them leading to specific predictions
for the ratios of family universal sfermion masses at the GUT scale,
$m^2_{\bar{5}} = 2 m^2_{10}$ or $m^2_{\bar{5}} = (3/4) m^2_{10}$ (in SU(5)
notation). These ratios are determined by group factors and are peculiar enough
to make this scheme testable at the LHC. We also discuss three possible
approaches to the $\mu$-problem, one of them distinctive of TGM.
