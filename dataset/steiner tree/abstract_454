We have developed an application called Wikipedia Live Monitor that monitors
article edits on different language versions of Wikipedia, as they happen in
realtime. Wikipedia articles in different languages are highly interlinked. For
example, the English article en:2013_Russian_meteor_event on the topic of the
February 15 meteoroid that exploded over the region of Chelyabinsk Oblast,
Russia, is interlinked with the Russian article on the same topic. As we
monitor multiple language versions of Wikipedia in parallel, we can exploit
this fact to detect concurrent edit spikes of Wikipedia articles covering the
same topics, both in only one, and in different languages. We treat such
concurrent edit spikes as signals for potential breaking news events, whose
plausibility we then check with full-text cross-language searches on multiple
social networks. Unlike the reverse approach of monitoring social networks
first, and potentially checking plausibility on Wikipedia second, the approach
proposed in this paper has the advantage of being less prone to false-positive
alerts, while being equally sensitive to true-positive events, however, at only
a fraction of the processing cost.
