The decomposition theorem for torsion abelian groups holds analogously for
torsion commutative diassociative loops. With this theorem in mind, we
investigate commutative diassociative loops satisfying the additional condition
(trivially satisfied in the abelian group case) that all $n$th powers are
central, for a fixed $n$. For $n=2$, we get precisely commutative $C$ loops.
For $n=3$, a prominent variety is that of commutative Moufang loops.
  Many analogies between commutative C and Moufang loops have been noted in the
literature, often obtained by interchanging the role of the primes 2 and 3. We
show that the correct encompassing variety for these two classes of loops is
the variety of commutative RIF loops. In particular, when $Q$ is a commutative
RIF loop: all squares in $Q$ are Moufang elements, all cubes are $C$ elements,
Moufang elements of $Q$ form a normal subloop $M_0(Q)$ such that $Q/M_0(Q)$ is
a C loop of exponent 2 (a Steiner loop), C elements of $L$ form a normal
subloop $C_0(Q)$ such that $Q/C_0(Q)$ is a Moufang loop of exponent 3. Since
squares (resp. cubes) are central in commutative C (resp. Moufang) loops, it
follows that $Q$ modulo its center is of exponent 6. Returning to the
decomposition theorem, we find that every torsion, commutative RIF loop is a
direct product of a C 2-loop, a Moufang 3-loop, and an abelian group with each
element of order prime to 6.
  We also discuss Moufang elements, and a class of quasigroups associated with
commutative RIF loops.
