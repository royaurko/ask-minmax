Graphs with bounded highway dimension were introduced in [Abraham et al.,
SODA 2010] as a model of transportation networks. We show that any such graph
can be embedded into a distribution over bounded treewidth graphs with
arbitrarily small distortion. More concretely, if the highway dimension of $G$
is constant we show how to randomly compute a subgraph of the shortest path
metric of the input graph $G$ with the following two properties: it distorts
the distances of $G$ by a factor of $1+\varepsilon$ in expectation and has a
treewidth that is polylogarithmic in the aspect ratio of $G$. In particular,
this result implies quasi-polynomial time approximation schemes for a number of
optimization problems that naturally arise on transportation networks,
including Travelling Salesman, Steiner Tree, and Facility Location.
  To construct our embedding for low highway dimension graphs we extend
Talwar's [STOC 2004] embedding of low doubling dimension metrics into bounded
treewidth graphs, which generalizes known results for Euclidean metrics. We add
several non-trivial ingredients to Talwar's techniques, and in particular
thoroughly analyze the structure of low highway dimension graphs. Thus we
demonstrate that the geometric toolkit used for Euclidean metrics extends
beyond the class of low doubling metrics.
