In this paper we calculate the technicolor correction to the production of a
charged top pion in association with a W boson via b\bar{b} annihilation at the
CERN Large Hadron Collider in the context of the topcolor assisted technicolor
model. We find that the cross section of pp \rightarrow b\bar{b} ->
W^{\pm}\pi_t^{\mp} at the tree level can reach a few hundred femtobarns for
reasonable ranges of the parameters, roughly corresponding to the result of the
process pp -> b\bar{b} -> W^{\pm}H^{\mp} in the minimal supersymmetric standard
model; the relative corrections arising from the one-loop diagrams are about a
few percent to two dozen percent, and they will increase the cross section at
the tree level. As a comparison, we also discuss the size of the hadron cross
section via the other subprocess gg -> W^{\pm}\pi_t^{\mp}.
