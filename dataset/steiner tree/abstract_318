Magnetic properties of four sigma-phase Fe_(100-x)V_x samples with
34.4<x<55.1 were investigated by Mossbauer spectroscopy and magnetic
measurements in the temperature interval 5-300 K. Four magnetic quantities viz.
hyperfine field, Curie temperature, magnetic moment and susceptibility were
determined. The sample containing 34.4 at% V was revealed to exhibit the
largest values found up to now for the sigma-phase for average hyperfine field,
B = 12.1 T, average magnetic moment per Fe atom, m = 0.89 mB, and Curie
temperature, TC = 315.5 K. The quantities were shown to be strongly correlated
with each other. In particular, TC is linearly correlated with m with a slope
of 406.5 K/mB, as well as B is so correlated with m yielding 14.3 T/mB for the
hyperfine coupling constant.
