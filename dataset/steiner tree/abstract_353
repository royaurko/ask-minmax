We compute the colour fields of SU(3) lattice QCD created by static
pentaquark systems, in a $24^3\times 48$ lattice at $\beta=6.2$ corresponding
to a lattice spacing $a=0.07261(85)$ fm. We find that the pentaquark colour
fields are well described by a multi-Y-type shaped flux tube. The flux tube
junction points are compatible with Fermat-Steiner points minimizing the total
flux tube length. We also compare the pentaquark flux tube profile with
diquark-diantiquark central flux tube profile in the tetraquark and the
quark-antiquark fundamental flux tube profile in the meson, and they match,
thus showing that the pentaquark flux tubes are composed of fundamental flux
tubes.
