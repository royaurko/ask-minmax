For a convex set (K) of the (n)-dimensional Euclidean space, the
Steiner-Minkowski polynomial (M_K(t)) is defined as the (n)-dimensional
Euclidean volume of the neighborhood of the radius (t). Being defined for
positive (t), the Steiner-Minkowski polynomials are considered for all complex
(t). The renormalization procedure for Steiner polynomial is proposed. The
renormalized Steiner-Minkowski polynomials corresponding to all possible solid
convex sets in all dimensions form a normal family in the whole complex plane.
For each of the four families of convex sets: the Euclidean balls, the cubes,
the regular cross-polytopes and the regular symplexes of dimensions (n), the
limiting entire functions, as (n) tends to infinity, are calculated explicitly.
