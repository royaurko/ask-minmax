In the town of Saratov where he was prisonner, Poncelet, continuing the work
of Euler and Steiner on polygons simultaneously inscribed in a circle and
circumscribed around an other circle, proved the following generalization :
"Let C and D be two smooth conics in the projective complex plane. If D passes
through the n(n-1)/2 vertices of a complete polygon with n sides tangent to C
then D passes through the vertices of infinitely many such polygons." According
to Marcel Berger this theorem is the nicest result about the geometry of
conics. Even if it is, there are few proofs of it. To my knowledge there are
only three. The first proof, published in 1822 and based on infinitesimal
deformations, is due to Poncelet. Later, Jacobi proposed a new proof based on
finite order points on elliptic curves; his proof, certainly the most famous,
is explained in a modern way and in detail by Griffiths and Harris. In 1870
Weyr proved a Poncelet theorem in space (more precisely for two quadrics) that
implies the one above when one quadric is a cone; this proof is explained by
Barth and Bauer. Our aim in this short note is to involve vector bundles
techniques to propose a new proof of this celebrated result. Poncelet did not
appreciate Jacobi's for the reason that it was too far from the geometric
intuition. I guess that he would not appreciate our proof either for the same
reason.
