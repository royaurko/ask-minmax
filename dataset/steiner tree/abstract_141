The roles of isospin asymmetry in nuclei and neutron stars are investigated
using a range of potential and field-theoretical models of nucleonic matter.
The parameters of these models are fixed by fitting the properties of
homogeneous bulk matter and closed-shell nuclei. We discuss and unravel the
causes of correlations among the neutron skin thickness in heavy nuclei, the
pressure of beta-equilibrated matter at a density of 0.1 fm$^{-3}$, and the
radii of moderate mass neutron stars. The influence of symmetry energy on
observables in heavy-ion collisions is summarized.
