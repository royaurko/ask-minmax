We have investigated a time series of continuum intensity maps and
corresponding Dopplergrams of granulation in a very quiet solar region at the
disk center, recorded with the Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment (IMaX) on board
the balloon-borne solar observatory Sunrise. We find that granules frequently
show substructure in the form of lanes composed of a leading bright rim and a
trailing dark edge, which move together from the boundary of a granule into the
granule itself. We find strikingly similar events in synthesized intensity maps
from an ab initio numerical simulation of solar surface convection. From cross
sections through the computational domain of the simulation, we conclude that
these `granular lanes' are the visible signature of (horizontally oriented)
vortex tubes. The characteristic optical appearance of vortex tubes at the
solar surface is explained. We propose that the observed vortex tubes may
represent only the large-scale end of a hierarchy of vortex tubes existing near
the solar surface.
