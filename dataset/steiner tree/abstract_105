Given six points on a conic, Pascal's theorem gives rise to a well-known
configuration called the \emph{hexagrammum mysticum}. It consists of, amongst
other things, twenty Steiner points and twenty Cayley-Salmon lines. It is a
classical theorem due to von Staudt that the Steiner points fall into ten
conjugate pairs with reference to the conic; but this is not true of the C-S
lines for a general choice of six points. It is shown in this paper that the
C-S lines are pairwise conjugate precisely when the original sextuple
is~\emph{tri-involutive}. The variety of tri-involutive sextuples turns out to
be arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay of codimension two. We determine its
$SL_2$-equivariant minimal resolution.
