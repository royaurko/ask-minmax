We present a spectroscopic analysis of the black hole binary Nova Muscae 1991
in quiescence using data obtained in 2009 with MagE on the Magellan Clay
telescope and in 2010 with IMACS on the Magellan Baade telescope at the Las
Campanas Observatory. Emission from the disc is observed in H alpha, H beta and
Ca II (8662 A). A prominent hotspot is observed in the Doppler maps of all
three emission lines. The existence of this spot establishes ongoing mass
transfer from the donor star in 2009-2010 and, given its absence in the
1993-1995 observations, demonstrates the presence of a variable hotspot in the
system. We find the radial distance to the hotspot from the black hole to be
consistent with the circularization radius. Our tomograms are suggestive of
stream-disc overflow in the system. We also detect possible Ca II (8662 A)
absorption from the donor star.
