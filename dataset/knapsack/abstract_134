  This paper presents a heuristic to solve the Multidimensional Multiple-choice Knapsack Problem (MMKP), a variant of the classical 0–1 Knapsack Problem. We apply a transformation technique to map the multidimensional resource consumption to single dimension. Convex hulls are constructed to reduce the search space to find the near-optimal solution of the MMKP. We present the computational complexity of solving the MMKP using this approach. A comparative analysis of different heuristics for solving the MMKP has been presented based on the experimental results. Keywords Algorithms ; Convex hull ; Heuristics ; MMKP ; Multimedia systems 1. Introduction and definition of MMKP The classical 0–1 Knapsack Problem (KP) is to pick up items for a knapsack for maximum total value, so that the total resource required does not exceed the resource constraint R R of the knapsack. The classical 0–1 KP and its variants are used in many resource management applications such as cargo loading, industrial production, menu planning, and resource allocation in multimedia servers [1] , [2]  and  [3] . Let there be n items with values   v 1 ,v 2 ,…,v n v 1 , v 2 , … , v n and let the corresponding resources required to pick the items be r 1 ,r 2 ,…,r n r 1 , r 2 , … , r n , respectively. The items can represent services and their associated values can be values of revenue   earned from that service. In mathematical notation, the 0–1 KP is to find V = maximize ∑ i = 1 n x i v i , subject to the constraint ∑ i = 1 n x i r i ⩽ R and x i ∈{0,1} x i ∈ { 0 , 1 } . The 0–1 KP is an NP-hard problem [4] . There is a pseudo-polynomial algorithm running in O( nR ) O ( nR ) time using the concept of dynamic programming.
