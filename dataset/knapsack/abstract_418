  By the method of region counting, a lower bound of n log 2 nn queries is obtained onlinear search tree programs which solve the n -dimensional knapsack problem. The region counting involves studying the structure of a subset of the hyperplanes defined by the problem. For this subset of hyperplanes, the result is shown to be tight. 1. D. Borkin and R.
