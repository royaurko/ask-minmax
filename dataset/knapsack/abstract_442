  In this paper, the chance-constrained knapsack problem (CKP) is addressed. Relying on robust optimization, a tractable combinatorial algorithm is proposed to solve approximately CKP. For two specific classes of uncertain knapsack problems, it is proved to solve CKP at optimality. Keywords Robust optimization ; Knapsack problem ; Stochastic programming Chance-constrained programming is a very attractive part of stochastic optimization (see for instance  [6]  and  [9] ). It is devoted to finding the best solution which remains feasible with probability at least 1−ε 1 − ε , for a given ε>0 ε > 0 . While the direct resolution of chance-constrained programs is often very difficult, some robust optimization frameworks enable to deal with these problems in a tractable way [2]  and  [5] . More precisely, given an initial set of uncertain events, the authors propose a way to relax it into a subset of events of probability not less than 1−ε 1 − ε , so that the associated robust optimization problem is tractable. As a result, solving the robust problem provides a feasible solution for the chance-constrained problem. The links between chance-constrained programming and robust optimization have been underlined quite recently.  [7] compares both approaches and proposes an intermediate solution framework. The authors study the randomized construction of a set of events with the following property: a solution robust to this set of events is a solution of a chance-constrained program (see also  [11] ).  [12] shows how the robust optimization framework developed in  [2]  and  [3] provides an approximation of chance-constrained programming, and improves on these previous works.  [8] also proposes robust optimization as a technique to obtain feasible solutions to chance-constrained programs. In the same line, we propose to use robust optimization techniques to provide a solution to chance-constrained problems. This paper focuses on the knapsack problem, because of its importance for integer linear programming. This work is based on the robust approach of Bertsimas and Sim  [5] . 2. Problems and formulations 2.1. The Chance-constrained Knapsack Problem Let I={1,…,n} I = { 1 , … , n } . Given a profit vector p ∈ R + n , a weight vector w ∈ R + n and a knapsack capacity c>0 c > 0 , the classical knapsack problem is: max x∈{0,1} n {∑ i∈I p i x i ∣∑ i∈I w i x i ≤c} max x ∈ { 0 , 1 } n { ∑ i ∈ I p i x i ∣ ∑ i ∈ I w i x i ≤ c } . For an extensive study of the knapsack problem, we refer for instance to  [10] .
