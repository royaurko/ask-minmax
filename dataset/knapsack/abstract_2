We consider bounded integer knapsacks where the weights and variable upper
bounds together form a superincreasing sequence. The elements of this
superincreasing knapsack are exactly those vectors that are lexicographically
smaller than the greedy solution to optimizing over this knapsack. We describe
the convex hull of this $n$-dimensional set with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ facets. We
also establish a distributive property by proving that the convex hull of
$\le$- and $\ge$-type superincreasing knapsacks can be obtained by intersecting
the convex hulls of $\le$- and $\ge$-sets taken individually. Our proofs
generalize existing results for the binary case.
