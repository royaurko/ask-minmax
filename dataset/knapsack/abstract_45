We study contextual bandits with ancillary constraints on resources, which
are common in real-world applications such as choosing ads or dynamic pricing
of items. We design the first algorithm for solving these problems that handles
constrained resources other than time, and improves over a trivial reduction to
the non-contextual case. We consider very general settings for both contextual
bandits (arbitrary policy sets, e.g. Dudik et al. (UAI'11)) and bandits with
resource constraints (bandits with knapsacks, Badanidiyuru et al. (FOCS'13)),
and prove a regret guarantee with near-optimal statistical properties.
