We present a branch and bound algorithm for solving separable convex quadratic knapsack problems with lower and upper bounds on the integer variables. The algorithm solves a series of continuous quadratic knapsack problems via their Kuhn-Tucker conditions. We also discuss reoptimization procedures for efficiently solving the continuous subproblems. Computational results for problems with up to 300 integer variables are reported.
