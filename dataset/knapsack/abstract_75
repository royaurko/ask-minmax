The Journal of the Operational Research Society Description: The Editorial Policy of the Journal of the Operational Research Society is: The Journal is a peer-refereed journal published 12 times a year on behalf of the Operational Research Society. It is the aim of the Journal to publish papers, including those from non-members of the Society, which are relevant to practitioners, researchers, teachers, students and consumers of operational research, and which cover the theory, practice, history or methodology of operational research. However, since operational research is primarily an applied science, it is a major objective of the Journal to attract and publish accounts of good, practical case studies. Consequently, papers illustrating applications of OR to real problems are especially welcome. Coverage: 1978-2011 (Vol. 29, No. 1 - Vol. 62, No. 12) Moving Wall The "moving wall" represents the time period between the last issue available in JSTOR and the most recently published issue of a journal. Moving walls are generally represented in years. In rare instances, a publisher has elected to have a "zero" moving wall, so their current issues are available in JSTOR shortly after publication. Note: In calculating the moving wall, the current year is not counted. For example, if the current year is 2008 and a journal has a 5 year moving wall, articles from the year 2002 are available. Terms Related to the Moving Wall Fixed walls: Journals with no new volumes being added to the archive. Absorbed: Journals that are combined with another title. Complete: Journals that are no longer published or that have been combined with another title. Subjects: Business & Economics, Business
