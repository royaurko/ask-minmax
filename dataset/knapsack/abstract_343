  A promising solution approach called Meta-RaPS is presented for the 0-1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (0-1 MKP). Meta-RaPS constructs feasible solutions at each iteration through the utilization of a priority rule used in a randomized fashion. Four different greedy priority rules are implemented within Meta-RaPS and compared. These rules differ in the way the corresponding pseudo-utility ratios for ranking variables are computed. In addition, two simple local search techniques within Meta-RaPS' improvement stage are implemented. The Meta-RaPS approach is tested on several established test sets, and the solution values are compared to both the optimal values and the results of other 0-1 MKP solution techniques. The Meta-RaPS approach outperforms many other solution methodologies in terms of differences from the optimal value and number of optimal solutions obtained. The advantage of the Meta-RaPS approach is that it is easy to understand and easy to implement, and it achieves good results. Keywords Meta-heuristics ; Optimization ; Greedy algorithm ; 0-1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem Significant attention has been lately focused on the 0-1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (0-1 MKP), which is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial problem. The importance of the 0-1 MKP arises from both real-world and theoretical standpoints. The 0-1 MKP embraces many practical applications, some of them include cutting stock problems ( Gilmore & Gomory, 1966 ), loading problems ( Bellman, 1957  and  Shih, 1979 ), delivery of groceries in vehicles with multiple compartments ( Chajakis & Guignard, 1992 ), project selection ( Petersen, 1967  and  Kyparisis et al., 1996 ), capital budgeting ( Weingartner, 1967 ), and allocating processors and data in distributed computer systems ( Gavish & Pirkul, 1982 ). In addition, the set covering and multicovering problems can be reformulated as an equivalent 0-1 MKP through variable complementing ( Hochbaum, 1996  and  Bertsimas and Demir, 2002 ) and the vehicle routing problem can be reduced to the 0-1 knapsack problem for some special conditions ( Eilon, Watson-Gabdy, & Christofides, 1971 ). The simple knapsack problem seeks to determine which of n given items of merchandise to place and carry in a knapsack for sale in a far-away market such that the total profit is maximized while the total weight does not exceed a given limit. An extensive treatment of the simple knapsack problem is provided by Martello and Toth (1990) . The 0-1 MKP involves a knapsack with m constraints with restrictions b 1 , b 2 , b 3 , …, b m and n items, each of which can earn a profit c i . The i th item has a coefficient of a ij when it is considered for the j th constraint. Typical constraints might include total weight, total volume, number of units, etc. In mathematical terms, the 0-1 MKP can be formulated as follows: equation ( 1 ) equation ( 2 ) equation ( 3 ) where x i = { 1 if item i included in knapsack 0 otherwise } . Several solution approaches are proposed in the literature for the 0-1 MKP. Exact algorithms based on a branch and bound technique are proposed by Shih, 1979  and  Osorio et al., 2003 . Some exact algorithms based on the use of dynamic programming methods have been also reported ( Gilmore and Gomory, 1966 , Weingartner and Ness, 1967 , Weingartner and Ness, 1967  and  Weingartner and Ness, 1967 ) but with limited success for modest-size problems. Bertsimas and Demir (2002) introduced an approximate dynamic programming approach, which seems to be promising when compared with other methods. Heuristic applications to the 0-1 MKP vary from simple ranking lists for constructing a solution to meta-heuristic based approaches. Greedy ranking heuristics are proposed by Senyu and Toyoda, 1968 , Eilon et al., 1971 , Toyoda, 1975  and  Loulou and Michaelides, 1978 . Balas and Martin, 1980 , Lee and Guignard, 1988  and  Chu and Beasley, 1998 develop heuristics based on the linear programming relaxation of the integer programming 0-1 MKP.
