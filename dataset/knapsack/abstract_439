The relation between ACO algorithms and evolutionary algorithms provides a structured way of handling constrained problems which the other approaches are lacking. The idea of ACO algorithms come from nature, the (artificial) ants use (artificial) pheromone to evaluate solutions. In this paper we present a new procedure to update the pheromone using additional reinforcement. Our modified ACO algorithm differs from the original ACO algorithms in several important aspects, whose usefulness we demonstrate by means of an experimental study.
