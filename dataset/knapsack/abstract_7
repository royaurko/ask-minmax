We address the classical knapsack problem and a variant in which an upper
bound is imposed on the number of items that can be selected. We show that
appropriate combinations of rounding techniques yield novel and powerful ways
of rounding. As an application of these techniques, we present a linear-storage
Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) and a Fully Polynomial Time
Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) that compute an approximate solution, of any fixed
accuracy, in linear time. This linear complexity bound gives a substantial
improvement of the best previously known polynomial bounds.
