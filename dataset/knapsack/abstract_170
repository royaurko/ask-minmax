Volume 5385 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 566-576 Budget Constrained Bidding in Keyword Auctions and Online Knapsack Problems Yunhong Zhou Affiliated with Rocket Fuel Inc , Deeparnab Chakrabarty Affiliated with Georgia Tech , Rajan Lukose Affiliated with HP Labs We consider the budget-constrained bidding optimization problem for sponsored search auctions, and model it as an online (multiple-choice) knapsack problem . We design both deterministic and randomized algorithms for the online (multiple-choice) knapsack problems achieving a provably optimal competitive ratio. This translates back to fully automatic bidding strategies maximizing either profit or revenue for the budget-constrained advertiser. Our bidding strategy for revenue maximization is oblivious (i.e., without knowledge) of other bidders’ prices and/or clickthrough-rates for those positions. We evaluate our bidding algorithms using both synthetic data and real bidding data gathered manually, and also discuss a sniping heuristic that strictly improves bidding performance. With sniping and parameter tuning enabled, our bidding algorithms can achieve a performance ratio above 90% against the optimum by the omniscient bidder.
