Dynamic circuits are well suited for applications that require predictable
service with a constant bit rate for a prescribed period of time, such as cloud
computing and e-science applications. Past research on upstream transmission in
passive optical networks (PONs) has mainly considered packet-switched traffic
and has focused on optimizing packet-level performance metrics, such as
reducing mean delay. This study proposes and evaluates a dynamic circuit and
packet PON (DyCaPPON) that provides dynamic circuits along with packet-switched
service. DyCaPPON provides $(i)$ flexible packet-switched service through
dynamic bandwidth allocation in periodic polling cycles, and $(ii)$ consistent
circuit service by allocating each active circuit a fixed-duration upstream
transmission window during each fixed-duration polling cycle. We analyze
circuit-level performance metrics, including the blocking probability of
dynamic circuit requests in DyCaPPON through a stochastic knapsack-based
analysis. Through this analysis we also determine the bandwidth occupied by
admitted circuits. The remaining bandwidth is available for packet traffic and
we conduct an approximate analysis of the resulting mean delay of packet
traffic. Through extensive numerical evaluations and verifying simulations we
demonstrate the circuit blocking and packet delay trade-offs in DyCaPPON.
