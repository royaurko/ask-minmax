Currently, short signature is receiving significant attention since it is
particularly useful in low-bandwidth communication environments. However, most
of the short signature schemes are only based on one intractable assumption.
Recently, Su presented an identity-based short signature scheme based on
knapsack and bilinear pairing. He claimed that the signature scheme is secure
in the random oracle model. Unfortunately, in this paper, we show that his
scheme is insecure. Concretely, an adversary can forge a valid signature on any
message with respect to any identity in Su's scheme.
