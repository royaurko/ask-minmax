We proposed a new attack against Hwang et al.'s cryptosystem. This
cryptosystem uses a super-increasing sequence as private key and the contributors
investigate a new algorithm called permutation combination algorithm to enhance
density of knapsack to avoid the low-density attack. Sattar J. Aboud [Aboud j.
Sattar, "An improved knapsack public key cryptography system", International
Journal of Internet Technology and Secured Transactions, Vol.3 (3), pp.310-319,
2011] used Shamir's attack on the basic Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem to break
this cryptosystem.
  In this paper, we introduce a direct attack against Hwang et al.'s
cryptosystem based on Lattice basis reduction algorithms. By computing
complexity of propose attack, we show that unlike Aboud's cryptanalysis, our
cryptanalysis is more efficient and practicable.
