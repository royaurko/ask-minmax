  Three regions arising as surrogates in certain network design problems are the knapsack set X = xϵZ n + : ∑ n j =1 C j x j ⩾ b , the simple capacitated flow set Y = ( y , x ) ϵR 1 + × Z n + : y ⩽ b , y ⩽ ∑ n j =1 C j X j , and the set Z = ( y , x ) ϵ R n + × Z n + : ∑ n j =1 y j ⩽ b , y j ⩽ C j x j for j = 1,…, n where the capacity C j +1 is an integer multiple C j for all j . We present algorithms for optimization over the sets X and Y , as well as different descriptions of the convex hulls and fast combinatorial algorithms for separation. Some partial results are given for the set Z and another extension. References [1] W.A.
