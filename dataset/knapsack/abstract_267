In this paper, the problem of determining an optimal file allocation in a distributed database is considered. The solution method is based on the isomorphism between the non-redundant file allocation problem and the “multiple choice constraints” knapsack problem, which is a well-known, classical problem of operations research. An ‘ad hoc’ branch and bound algorithm is then introduced for the redundant file allocation problem. Computational results showing the efficiency of the proposed technique are included.
