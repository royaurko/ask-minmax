  The paper proposes a new ant colony optimization (ACO) approach, called binary ant system (BAS), to multidimensional Knapsack problem (MKP). Different from other ACO-based algorithms applied to MKP, BAS uses a pheromone laying method specially designed for the binary solution structure, and allows the generation of infeasible solutions in the solution construction procedure. A problem specific repair operator is incorporated to repair the infeasible solutions generated in every iteration. Pheromone update rule is designed in such a way that pheromone on the paths can be directly regarded as selecting probability. To avoid premature convergence, the pheromone re-initialization and different pheromone intensification strategy depending on the convergence status of the algorithm are incorporated. Experimental results show the advantages of BAS over other ACO-based approaches for the benchmark problems selected from OR library.

Introduction The multidimensional Knapsack problem (MKP) is one of the most intensively studied discrete programming problem [1] . Many practical problems can be formulated as a MKP, such as the capital budgeting problem, allocating processors and databases in a distributed computer system, project selection and cargo loading, and cutting stock problem. Formally, MKP can be formulated as equation ( 1 ) maximize f ( x ) = ∑ j = 1 n p j x j equation ( 2 ) equation ( 3 ) Each of the m constraints described in condition (2) is called a Knapsack constraint, so the MKP is also called the m   -dimensional Knapsack problem. Let I={1,2,…,m} I = { 1 , 2 , … , m } and J={1,2,…,n} J = { 1 , 2 , … , n } , with b i >0 b i > 0 for all i∈I i ∈ I and r ij ⩾0 r ij ⩾ 0 for all i∈I,j∈J i ∈ I , j ∈ J , a well-stated MKP assumes that p j >0 p j > 0 and r ij ⩽ b i < ∑ j = 1 n r ij for all i∈I,j∈J i ∈ I , j ∈ J .
