We describe a technique to obtain linear descriptions for polytopes from
extended formulations. The simple idea is to first define a suitable lifting
function and then to find linear constraints that are valid for the polytope
and guarantee lifted points to be contained in the extension. We explain the
technique at an example from the literature (matching polytopes), obtain new
simple proofs of results on path-set polytopes and small-cliques polytopes, and
finally exploit the technique in order to derive linear descriptions of
orbisacks, which are special Knapsack polytopes arising in the context of
symmetry breaking in integer programming problems.
