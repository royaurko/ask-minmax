We propose a variation of the standard genetic algorithm that incorporates
social interaction between the individuals in the population. Our goal is to
understand the evolutionary role of social systems and its possible application
as a non-genetic new step in evolutionary algorithms. In biological
populations, ie animals, even human beings and microorganisms, social
interactions often affect the fitness of individuals. It is conceivable that
the perturbation of the fitness via social interactions is an evolutionary
strategy to avoid trapping into local optimum, thus avoiding a fast convergence
of the population. We model the social interactions according to Game Theory.
The population is, therefore, composed by cooperator and defector individuals
whose interactions produce payoffs according to well known game models
(prisoner's dilemma, chicken game, and others). Our results on Knapsack
problems show, for some game models, a significant performance improvement as
compared to a standard genetic algorithm.
