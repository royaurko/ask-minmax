We show that our new algorithm obtains better results than two other ACO algorithms on most instances. Citation Context ...s. This algorithm is based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [4], a stochastic metaheuristic that has been applied to solve many combinatorial optimization problems such as traveling salesman problems =-=[3]-=-, quadratic assignment problems [6], or vehicule routing problems [1].
