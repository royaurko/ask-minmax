  We present a PTAS for the Multiple Subset Sum Problem (MSSP) with different knapsack capacities. This is the selection of items from a given ground set and their assignment to a given number of knapsacks such that the sum of the item weights in every knapsack does not exceed its capacity and the total sum of the weights of the packed items is as large as possible. Our result generalizes the PTAS for the special case in which all knapsack capacities are identical [? ] . Keywords Multiple Subset Sum Problem ; PTAS ; Algorithms 1 A. Caprara, H. Kellerer, U.
