The objective is to maximize the probability that the overall return equals or exceeds a specified target value. A previously proposed preference order dynamic programming-based algorithm has been shown to be potentially suboptimal. We offer an alternative hybrid DP/branch-and-bound algorithm that both guarantees optimality and significantly outperforms generating the set of Pareto optimal returns.© 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
