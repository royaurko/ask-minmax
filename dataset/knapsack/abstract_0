We observed few important facts that concerns with the new proposal of
knapsack cipher 0/255, recently published by Pham [1]. The contributor claimed that
the time complexity for solving new improved trapdoor knapsack is O(256^N). In
this paper, we show that the knapsack cipher 0/255 can be solved in the same
time that is required for solving the basic knapsack-cipher proposed by Merkle
and Hellman [2]. In other words we claim that the improved version proposed by
Pham [1] is technically same as the basic Merkle and Hellman Knapsack-based
cryptosystem.
