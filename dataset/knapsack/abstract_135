Enumeration techniques have been shown to be successful for solving integer linear programming problems. The purpose of this paper is to apply the enumeration philosophy to the classical knapsack problem; it shows that this approach applies quite naturally to this type of integer linear program when combined with the Fourier-Motzkin elimination method for solving linear inequalities. Some computational results are reported.
