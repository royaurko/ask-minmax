There are several approaches for solving the different variations of such problem, including mathematical programming and stochastic heuristic methods. This paper presents the application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for the problem, using selected instances of ORLib. For the instances tested, results were very close or equal to the optimal solution known, even considering that the parameters of PSO were not optimized. The analysis of the results suggests the potential of a simple PSO for this class of combinatorial problems.
