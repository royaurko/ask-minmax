  In this paper, we describe a new approach to tabu search (TS) based on strategic oscillation and surrogate constraint information that provides a balance between intensification and diversification strategies. New rules needed to control the oscillation process are given for the 0–1 multidimensional knapsack (0–1 MKP). Based on a portfolio of test problems from the literature, our method obtains solutions whose quality is at least as good as the best solutions obtained by previous methods, especially with large scale instances. These encouraging results confirm the efficiency of the tunneling concept coupled with surrogate information when resource constraints are present.
