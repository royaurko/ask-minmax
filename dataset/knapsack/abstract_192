This paper presents the results of an empirical study of the effects of coefficient correlation structure and constraint slackness settings on the performance of solution procedures on synthetic two-dimensional knapsack problems (2KP). The population correlation structure among 2KP coefficients, the level of constraint slackness, and the type of correlation (product moment or rank) are varied in this study. Representative branch-and-bound and heuristic solution procedures are used to investigate the influence of these problem parameters on solution procedure performance. Population correlation structure, and in particular the interconstraint component of the correlation structure, is found to be a significant factor influencing the performance of both the algorithm and the heuristic. In addition, the interaction between constraint slackness and population correlation structure is found to influence solution procedure performance.
