First we compare Lamarckian and Baldwinian with each other. Experimental results show that the Baldwinian repair outperforms the Lamarckian repair. It is also shown that these repair schemes outperform a penalty function approach. Then we examine partial Lamarckianism where the Lamarckian repair is applied to each individual with a prespecified probability. Experimental results show that a so-called 5% rule works well. Finally partial Lamarckianism is compared with an island model with two subpopulations where each island has a different repair scheme. Experimental results show that the island model slightly outperforms the standard single-population model with the 50% partial Lamarckian repair in terms of the diversity of solutions.
