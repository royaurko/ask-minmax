Password:   The 0-1 knapsack problem is an open issue in discrete optimization problems, which plays an important role in real applications. In this paper, a new bio-inspired model is proposed to solve this problem. The proposed method has three main steps. First, the 0-1 knapsack problem is converted into a directed graph by the network converting algorithm. Then, for the purpose of using the amoeboid organism model, the longest path problem is transformed into the shortest path problem. Finally, the shortest path problem can be well handled by the amoeboid organism algorithm. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model.

Introduction The 0-1 knapsack problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the count of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible [1] , [2] , [3]  and  [4] . It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most useful items. This model is widely used in real-life applications: capital budgeting problems [5]  and  [6] , loading problems [7] , [8]  and  [9] , resource allocation [10] , [11]  and  [12] , project selection problems [13] and can be found as a sub problem of other more general models [14] , [15] , [16]  and  [17] . A number of approaches have been proposed to solve it by dynamic programming [18] , [19] , [20]  and  [21] . Balev presented a preprocessing procedure for the 0-1 multidimensional knapsack problem [18] . Bazgan proposed an approach based on dynamic programming, for solving the 0-1 multi-objective knapsack problem [20] . In these approaches, the number of states is equal to the capacity of the knapsack. On the other hand, some methods such as mathematical programming [22]  and  [23] , have been proposed to obtain the optimal solution of this problem [24] , [25]  and  [26] . Pérez–Jiménez presented a family of recognizer P systems solving the knapsack problem [24] . However, a pre-computation is needed and this pre-computation requires a polynomial number of steps. Hifi proposed an exact algorithm to solve the knapsack sharing problem [25] . The above methods seem difficult to solve the knapsack problem when it becomes complex. In recent decades, a number of bio-inspired methods have been proposed to solve complex problems with high complexity [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31]  and  [32] , such as genetic algorithms in [33] , and simulated annealing in [34] . Shi modified the parameters of the ant colony optimization (ACO) model to adapt itself to 0-1 knapsack problem [28] . The modified ACO algorithm has the ability to escape from the local optimum. Chu proposed a heuristic based upon genetic algorithms for the multidimensional knapsack problem [35] . The proposed model is capable of obtaining high-quality solutions for problems of various characteristics. Hembecke presented the application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for the problem and the results are very close or equal to the optimal solution known [36]  and  [37] . It demonstrates that, compared with the methods based on dynamic programming, bio-inspired methods are effective ways to solve 0-1 knapsack problem. As a result, it is meaningful to explore some new bio-inspired methods to handle the 0-1 knapsack problem. Recently, it is shown that an amoeboid organism can find the shortest path between two selected points in a labyrinth [38] , [39] , [40]  and  [41] , which provides an effective method to solve optimization problems. However, best to our knowledge, the amoeboid organism has not been used to solve 0-1 knapsack problem. In this paper, a new method using the amoeboid organism model is proposed to solve the 0-1 knapsack problem. In the proposed method, the 0-1 knapsack problem is converted into a longest path problem in the network first. Then, in order to successful use of the amoeboid organism model, the longest path problem is transformed into the shortest path problem. Finally, the amoeboid organism model is used to find the shortest path. Numerical examples are illustrated to show the efficiency of the proposed method. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces the 0-1 knapsack problem, the mathematical model of the amoeboid organism. Section 3 details the new proposed method to solve 0-1 knapsack problem. Section 4 gives serval examples to show the efficiency of the proposed method. Section 5 ends the paper with conclusions. 2. Preliminaries In this section, the model of 0-1 knapsack problem and the amoeboid organism are introduced.
