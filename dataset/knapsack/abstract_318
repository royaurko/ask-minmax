Volume 869 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 134-143 Date: 09 June 2005 Genetic algorithms for the 0/1 knapsack problem Zbigniew Michalewicz Affiliated with Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina , Jarosław Arabas Affiliated with Institute of Electronics Fundamentals, Warsaw University of Technology In this paper the utility of several constraint-handling techniques is investigated on the basis of a family of 0/1 knapsack problems. Several evolutionary algorithms are applied to this NP-hard problem. The conclusions might be applicable to many constrained combinatorial optimization problems, for which the use of evolutionary algorithm is considered.
