Volume 547 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 39-53 Date: 18 May 2001 The Knapsack Hash Function proposed at Crypto’89 can be broken Paul Camion Affiliated with Domaine de Voluceau — Rocquencourt, INRIA , Jacques Patarin Affiliated with Domaine de Voluceau — Rocquencourt, INRIA Ivan Damgård [ 4 ] suggested at Crypto’89 concrete examples of hash functions among which a knapsack scheme. We will here show that a probabilistic algorithm can break this scheme with a number in the region of 2 32 computations. That number of operations is feasible in realistic time with modern computers. Thus the proposed hash function is not very secure. Among those computations a substantial number can be performed once for all. A faster result can be obtained since parallelism is easy. Moreover, ways to extend the present algorithm to other knapsacks than the present (256, 128) suggested by Damgård are investigated. EUROCRYPT’91, Brighton, England
