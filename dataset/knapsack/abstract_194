This paper reports on a study of the effectiveness of penalty functions used with a standard genetic algorithm to solve a problem with constraints. Twelve different penalty functions were created and tested using a genetic algorithm to solve the zero-one knapsack problem. In addition to a comparison of the penalty functions, the relationship between the size of the solution space and the size of the search space was also considered
