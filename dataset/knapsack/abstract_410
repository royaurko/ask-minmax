We present how to apply Constraint Based Column Generation to a large class of subproblems, namely Constrained Knapsack Problems (CKP). They evolve e.g. from Cutting Stock Problems (see [7]) with additional constraints on the cutting patterns. Focussing on Constrained Knapsack Problems, we developed a new reduction algorithm for KP. It is being used as propagation routine for the CKP with O(n log n) preprocessing time and O(n) time per call. This sums up to an amortized time of O(n) for (log n) calls. Keywords: Constrained Based Column Generation, Constrained Knapsack Problems, Cutting Stock Problems, Reduction Algorithms. 1 Introduction Recently, a new framework for the integration of CP and OR within column generation approaches was developed, the so called Constraint Based Column Generation [11]. It describes a generic way of how to treat arbitrary constraints for the constrained subproblem in the column generation phase. The approach has been successfully used for the C... 9440 Introduction to Algorithms - Cormen, Leiserson, et al. - 2009 206 A generic arc-consistency algorithm and its specializations - Hentenryck, Deville, et al. - 1992 145 Time constrained routing and scheduling - Desrosiers, Dumas, et al. - 1995 144 Arc-consistency and arc-consistency again - Bessi√®re - 1994 141 A linear programming approach to the cutting stock problem - Gilmore, Gomory - 1963 118 P.: The decomposition algorithm for linear programs - Dantzig, Wolfe - 1961 42 A new approach to integrating mixed integer programming and constraint logic programming - Rodosek, Wallace, et al. - 1999 35 Combinatorial problem solving in constraint logic programming with cooperating solvers - Beringer, Backer - 1994 35 Branch-and-infer: A unifying framework for integer and finite domain constraint programming - Bockmayr, Kasper - 1998 15 Branch-and-price: Column generation for huge integer programs - Barnhart, Johnson, et al. - 1998 11 The preferential bidding system at Air Canada - Gamache, Soumis, et al. - 1998 1 Reference manual and user manual.
