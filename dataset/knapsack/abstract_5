The mixing set with a knapsack constraint arises as a substructure in
mixed-integer programming reformulations of chance-constrained programs with
stochastic right-hand-sides over a finite discrete distribution. Recently,
Luedtke et al. (2010) and K\"u\c{c}\"ukyavuz (2012) studied valid inequalities
for such sets. However, most of their results were focused on the equal
probabilities case (equivalently when the knapsack reduces to a cardinality
constraint), with only minor results in the general case. In this paper, we
focus on the general probabilities case (general knapsack constraint). We
characterize the valid inequalities that do not come from the knapsack polytope
and use this characterization to generalize the inequalities previously derived
for the equal probabilities case. We also show that one can separate over a
large class of inequalities in polynomial time.
