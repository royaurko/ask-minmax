The Quadratic Knapsack Problem (QKP) calls for maximizing a quadratic objective function subject to a knapsack constraint, where all coefficients are assumed to be nonnegative and all variables are binary. The problem has applications in location and hydrology, and generalizes the problem of checking whether a graph contains a clique of a given size. We propose an exact branch-and-bound algorithm for QKP, where upper bounds are computed by considering a Lagrangian relaxation that is solvable through a number of (continuous) knapsack problems. Suboptimal Lagrangian multipliers are derived by using subgradient optimization and provide a convenient reformulation of the problem. We also discuss the relationship between our relaxation and other relaxations presented in the literature. Heuristics, reductions, and branching schemes are finally described. In particular, the processing of each node of the branching tree is quite fast: We do not update the Lagrangian multipliers, and use suitable data structures to compute an upper bound in linear expected time in the number of variables. We report exact solution of instances with up to 400 binary variables, i.e., significantly larger than those solvable by the previous approaches. The key point of this improvement is that the upper bounds we obtain are typically within 1% of the optimum, but can still be derived effectively. We also show that our algorithm is capable of solving reasonable-size Max Clique instances from the literature.
