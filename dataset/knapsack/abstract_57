  The Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem is defined as a 0–1 Knapsack Problem with the addition of disjoined multiple-choice constraints. As for other knapsack problems most of the computational effort in the solution of these problems is used for sorting and reduction. But although O( n ) algorithms which solve the linear Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem without sorting have been known for more than a decade, such techniques have not been used in enumerative algorithms. In this paper we present a simple O( n ) partitioning algorithm for deriving the optimal linear solution, and show how it may be incorporated in a dynamic programming algorithm such that a minimal number of classes are enumerated, sorted and reduced. Computational experiments indicate that this approach leads to a very efficient algorithm which outperforms any known algorithm for the problem.
