  It is shown that any bounded integer linear programming problem can be trans- formed to an equivalent integer linear programming problem with a single constraint and the same number of variables. The original integer problem and the equivalent single constraint problem have identical feasible integer solutions, and thus the single constraint problem may be solved instead of the original problem. It is shown that any bounded integer programming problem is equivalent to a problem of optimizing a linear function subject only to bounds on the function and bounds on the variables. The results are extended to problems with nonlinear constraints. Algorithm and bound for the greatest common divisor of n integers Comm. ACM, 13 (1970), pp. 433–436 [3] G.H.
