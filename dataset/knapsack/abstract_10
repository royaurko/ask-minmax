We had recently shown that every positive integer can be represented uniquely
using a recurrence sequence, when certain restrictions on the digit strings are
satisfied. We present the details of how such representations can be used to
build a knapsack-like public key cryptosystem. We also present new disguising
methods, and provide arguments for the security of the code against known
methods of attack.
