We consider AC electrical systems where each electrical device has a power
demand expressed as a complex number, and there is a limit on the magnitude of
total power supply. Motivated by this scenario, we introduce the complex-demand
knapsack problem (C-KP), a new variation of the traditional knapsack problem,
where each item is associated with a demand as a complex number, rather than a
real number often interpreted as weight or size of the item. While keeping the
same goal as to maximize the sum of values of the selected items, we put the
capacity limit on the magnitude of the sum of satisfied demands. For C-KP, we
prove its inapproximability by FPTAS (unless P = NP), as well as presenting a
(1/2-epsilon)-approximation algorithm. Furthermore, we investigate the selfish
multi-agent setting where each agent is in charge of one item, and an agent may
misreport the demand and value of his item for his own interest. We show a
simple way to adapt our approximation algorithm to be monotone, which is
sufficient for the existence of incentive compatible payments such that no
agent has an incentive to misreport. Our results shed insight on the design of
multi-agent systems for smart grid.
