We show that there exists a family of Knapsack polytopes such that, for each
polytope P from this family and each {\epsilon} > 0, any
{\epsilon}-approximated formulation of P in the original space R^n requires a
number of inequalities that is super-polynomial in n. This answers a question
by Bienstock and McClosky (2012). We also prove that, for any down-monotone
polytope, an {\epsilon}-approximated formulation in the original space can be
obtained with inequalities using at most O(min{log(n/{\epsilon}),n}/{\epsilon})
different coefficients.
