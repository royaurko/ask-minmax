Given n elements with nonnegative integer weights w1,..., wn and an integer
capacity C, we consider the counting version of the classic knapsack problem:
find the number of distinct subsets whose weights add up to at most the given
capacity. We give a deterministic algorithm that estimates the number of
solutions to within relative error 1+-eps in time polynomial in n and 1/eps
(fully polynomial approximation scheme). More precisely, our algorithm takes
time O(n^3 (1/eps) log (n/eps)). Our algorithm is based on dynamic programming.
Previously, randomized polynomial time approximation schemes were known first
by Morris and Sinclair via Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, and
subsequently by Dyer via dynamic programming and rejection sampling.
