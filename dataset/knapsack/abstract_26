In an electronic auction protocol, the main participants are the seller, a
set of trusted auctioneer(s) and the set of bidders. In this paper we consider
the situation where there is a seller and a set of n bidders intending to come
to an agreement on the selling price of a certain good. Full private or
bidder-resolved auction means that this agreement is reached without the help
of trusted parties or auctioneers. Therefore, only the seller and the set of
bidders are involved, the role of the auctioneers becomes obsolete in this
case. property.We propose a new technique for the design of a full private
sealed-bid auction protocol.
