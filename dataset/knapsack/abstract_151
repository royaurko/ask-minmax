This paper is the second in a series of papers which examine a new method of cryptanalysis. This work focuses on the cryptanalysis of a knapsack cipher. It is based on the application of a directed random search algorithm called a genetic algorithm. It is shown that such a algorithm could be used to easily compromise even high density knapsack ciphers. PDF
