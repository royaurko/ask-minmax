In this note we present an efficient algorithm for the 0-1 knapsack problem and announce the availability of a callable FORTRAN subroutine which solves this problem. Computational results show that 50 variable problems can be solved in an average of 4 milliseconds and 200 variable problems in an average of 7 milliseconds on an IBM 360/91.
