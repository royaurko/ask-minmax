We introduce a general technique to create an extended formulation of a
mixed-integer program. We classify the integer variables into blocks, each of
which generates a finite set of vector values. The extended formulation is
constructed by creating a new binary variable for each generated value. Initial
experiments show that the extended formulation can have a more compact complete
description than the original formulation.
  We prove that, using this reformulation technique, the facet description
decomposes into one ``linking polyhedron'' per block and the ``aggregated
polyhedron''. Each of these polyhedra can be analyzed separately. For the case
of identical coefficients in a block, we provide a complete description of the
linking polyhedron and a polynomial-time separation algorithm. Applied to the
knapsack with a fixed number of distinct coefficients, this theorem provides a
complete description in an extended space with a polynomial number of
variables.
