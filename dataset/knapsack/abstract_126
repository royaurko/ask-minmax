Two genetic algorithms using different mappings were implemented to solve the problem. In one of these neither the order or position of genes is significant. Both of the genetic algorithms perform well on the problem, and we attribute the divergent parameter settings to the different mappings. 11865 Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness - Garey, Johnson - 1979 8655 Genetic Algorithms - Goldberg - 1989 1352 Handbook of Genetic Algorithms - Davis - 1991 131 Knapsack problems - Martello, Toth - 1990 130 Serial and parallel genetic algorithms as function optimizers - Gordon, Whitley - 1993 6 A note on the performance of genetic algorithms on zero-one knapsack problems - Gordon, Bohm, et al. - 1994 6 A genetic algorithm for stock cutting: An exploration of mapping schemes - Hinterding, Juliff - 1993 5 A Genetic Algorithm for Bin Packing and Line - Falkenauer - 1992 2 Improvement of genetic algorithm and its applications.
