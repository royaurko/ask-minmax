We introduce revlex-initial 0/1-polytopes as the convex hulls of
reverse-lexicographically initial subsets of 0/1-vectors. These polytopes are
special knapsack-polytopes. It turns out that they have remarkable extremal
properties. In particular, we use these polytopes in order to prove that the
minimum numbers f(d, n) of facets and the minimum average degree a(d, n) of the
graph of a d-dimensional 0/1-polytope with n vertices satisfy f(d, n) <= 3d and
a(d, n) <= d + 4. We furthermore show that, despite the sparsity of their
graphs, revlex-initial 0/1-polytopes satisfy a conjecture due to Mihail and
Vazirani, claiming that the graphs of 0/1-polytopes have edge-expansion at
least one.
