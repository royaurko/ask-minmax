Algorithms for Knapsack Problems (1995) @MISC{Pisinger95algorithmsfor,     author = {David Pisinger},     title = {Algorithms for Knapsack Problems},     year = {1995} } Years of Citing Articles This thesis considers a family of combinatorial problems known under the name Knapsack Problems. As all the problems are A7)-hard we are searching for exact solution techniques having reasonable solution times for nearly all instances encountered in practice, despite having exponential time bounds for a number of highly contrived problem instances. A similar behavior is known from the Simplex algorithm, which despite its exponential worst-case behavior has reasonable solution times for all realistic problems.
