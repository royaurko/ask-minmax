The problem of maximizing non-negative monotone submodular functions under a
certain constraint has been intensively studied in the last decade. In this
paper, we address the problem for functions defined over the integer lattice.
Suppose that a non-negative monotone submodular function $f:\mathbb{Z}_+^n \to
\mathbb{R}_+$ is given via an evaluation oracle. Furthermore, we assume that
$f$ satisfies the diminishing return property, which is not an immediate
consequence of the submodularity when the domain is the integer lattice. Then,
we show (i) a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for a cardinality
constraint with $\widetilde{O}(\frac{n}{\epsilon}\log \frac{r}{\epsilon})$
queries, where $r$ is the maximum cardinality of feasible solutions, (ii) a
$(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for a polymatroid constraint with
$\widetilde{O}(\frac{nr}{\epsilon^4}+n^6)$ queries, where $r$ is the rank of
the polymatroid, and (iii) a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for a
knapsack constraint with $\widetilde{O}(\frac{n^2}{\epsilon^{18}}\log
\frac{1}{w})(\frac{1}{\epsilon})^{O(1/\epsilon^8)}$ queries, where $w$ is the
minumum weight of elements.
  Our algorithms for polymatroid constraints and knapsack constraints first
extend the domain of the objective function to the Euclidean space and then run
the continuous greedy algorithm. We give two different kinds of continuous
extensions, one is for knapsack constraints and the other is for polymatroid
constraints, which might be of independent interest.
