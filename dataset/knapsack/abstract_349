Volume 2340 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 161-171 Date: 23 August 2002 Solving Knapsack Problems in a Sticker Based Model Mario J. Pérez-Jiménez Affiliated with Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Seville , Fernando Sancho-Caparrini Affiliated with Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Seville Our main goal in this paper is to give molecular solutions for two NP -complete problems, namely Subset-sum and Knapsack, in a sticker based model for DNA computations. In order to achieve this, we have used a finite set sorting subroutine together with the description of a procedure to formally verify the designed programs through the labeling of test tubes using inductive techniques.
