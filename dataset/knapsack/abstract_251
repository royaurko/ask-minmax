Password: Knapsack-based cryptosystems had been viewed as the most attractive and the most promising asymmetric cryptographic algorithms for a long time due to their NP-completeness nature and high speed in encryption/decryption. Unfortunately, most of them are broken for the low-density feature of the underlying knapsack problems. In this paper, we investigate a new easy compact knapsack problem and propose a novel knapsack-based probabilistic public-key cryptosystem in which the cipher-text is non-linear with the plaintext. For properly chosen parameters, the underlying knapsack problem enjoys a high density larger than 1.06 in the worst case. Hence, it is secure against the low-density subset-sum attacks. Our scheme can also defeat other potential attacks such as the brute force attacks and the simultaneous Diophantine approximation attack. Compared with previous knapsack-based cryptosystems, our scheme is efficient and practical.

Introduction The use of knapsack problem in public-key cryptography is due to Merkle and Hellman [15] . For a long time, the knapsack-type cryptosystems had been considered as the most attractive and promising cryptosystem due to their NP-completeness nature and high speed in encryption and decryption. These schemes employ various knapsack problems and their variants such as the 0–1 knapsack problem [15] , the compact knapsack problem [24] , the multiplicative knapsack problem [16]  and  [17] , the modular knapsack problem [5]  and  [20] , the matrix cover problem [7] , the group factorization problem [26] , the polynomials over GF(2) [25] , the Diophantine equations [14] , the complementing sets [33] , and so on. Unfortunately, most of them are shown vulnerable to the low-density subset-sum attacks [1] , [4]  and  [10] , the GCD attack [2] , the simultaneous Diophantine approximation attack [9] and the orthogonal lattice attack [19] . The situation shows that it is not trivial to design a secure knapsack-based cryptosystem although the knapsack problem is known NP-complete. For more details of the rise and fall of knapsack cryptosystems, we refer readers to the survey papers [11]  and  [21] . It is interesting to question why most knapsack-based cryptosystems are insecure. As shown in [2] , one reason is that the encryption functions in these cryptosystems are essentially linear. Also, as noticed in [4] , the density of the knapsack vector must be larger than 0.9408 to avoid low-density attacks. However, if the density is much larger than 1, the cipher-texts may not be correctly decrypted since the same cipher-text has more than one possible plaintexts. Moreover, the trapdoor may be easy to be discovered if the knapsack density is too high. Although there exist many obstacles to design a secure knapsack-based cryptosystem, it is believed [11] that a knapsack cryptosystem is “better” than those based on integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems if it can fully exploit the difficulty of the knapsack problem, achieve a high density, and include a difficult-to-discover trapdoor. It is still attractive to construct secure knapsack-based cryptosystems for computation power limited applications such as confidential communication via mobile phones. In such applications, the overhead of computation is a critical factor to be considered in practice. However, for the most popular public-key cryptosystems relying on the integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problems, both the encryption and the decryption suffer from a cubic computational complexity in the public-key size due to the costly modular exponential operations, while knapsack-based cryptosystems merely have a quadratic complexity in the dimension of the knapsack vector. Hence, cryptographers are encouraged to reconsider the knapsack-based cryptosystems. Recently, some new constructions have been proposed. For instance, Koskinen presented two non-injective knapsack cryptosystems [8] . Han et al. investigated the knapsack Diffie–Hellman problem [6] . Su et al. built a knapsack public-key cryptosystem based on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm [29] . Okamoto et al. suggested a low weight knapsack cryptosystem in [22] . In this paper, we concentrate on secure knapsack-based cryptosystems for computation power limited applications. We investigate a new easy compact knapsack problem. By exploiting this problem, we propose a novel probabilistic knapsack-based cryptosystem equipped with a non-linear encryption function. The proposal enjoys a high knapsack density under the relinearization attack model, and hence it is secure against low-density subset-sum attacks. The scheme is also shown secure against the brute force attack and the simultaneous Diophantine approximation attack. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the knapsack problem and investigates a new easy compact knapsack problem. We propose the encryption scheme in Section 3 and discuss the parameter selection and the performance of the proposal in Section 4 . The security is analyzed in Section 5 and a comparison between our scheme and other knapsack-based public-key cryptosystems is illustrated in Section 6 . Finally, some concluding remarks are presented in Section 7 . 2. Underlying hard problems In this section, we review the knapsack problem and investigate a new easy compact knapsack problem on which our knapsack cryptosystem relies. 2.1. Knapsack problem The compact knapsack problem states that, given b  ∈  Z , a cargo vector A  = { a 1 , … ,  a n } ∈  Z n and an integer s , find a vector X  = { x 1 , … ,  x n } such that equation ( 1 )
