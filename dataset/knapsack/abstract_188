The parallelization on a supercomputer of a one list dynamic programming algorithm using dominance technique and processor cooperation for the 0â€“1 knapsack problem is presented. Such a technique generates irregular data structure, moreover the number of undominated states is unforeseeable. Original and efficient load balancing strategies are proposed. Finally, computational results obtained with an Origin 3800 supercomputer are displayed and analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time for which computational experiments on a supercomputer are presented for a parallel dynamic programming algorithm using dominance technique.
