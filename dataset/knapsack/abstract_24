The paper presents new criteria for bijectivity/transitivity of T-functions
and fast knapsack-like algorithm of evaluation of a T-function. Our approach is
based on non-Archimedean ergodic theory: Both the criteria and algorithm use
van der Put series to represent 1-Lipschitz $p$-adic functions and to study
measure-preservation/ergodicity of these.
