Introduction The multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) is a generalization of the standard 0–1 knapsack problem. The goal of the problem is to find a subset of all items that yields maximum profit without exceeding the multidimensional resource capacities. The MKP is a typical discrete optimization problem with wide applications. Many real problems can be formulated as the MKP, such as capital budgeting [1] , resource allocating [2] , cargo loading [3] , cutting stock [4] , knowledge and economics engineering [5] , and pollution prevention and control [6] . The MKP has been shown to be strongly NP-hard [1] . In view of the pervasive nature of the MKP in knowledge-based system, there is abundant literature on the topic. Early solution algorithms are mainly exact methods, such as branch and bound algorithm (B&B) [3] , dynamic programming (DP) [7] , and the B&B and DP based hybridization method [8] . A recent breakthrough in developing effective methods for the MKP is the concept of core as described by Puchinger et al. [9] . Using the concept of core [10] can help to reduce the problem size significantly, which is useful in developing both the exact and approximate algorithms. Based on the concept of core, some effective algorithms have been developed for the knapsack problem (KP) [11]  and  [12] , the MKP [9] , the multiple-choice MKP [13] , and the bi-objective MKP [14] . Besides, some heuristics have also been presented for the MKP [15] , [16] , [17]  and  [18] . With the development of computational intelligence, some meta-heuristic methods have been proposed to solve the MKP. Relevant algorithms include simulated annealing [19] , genetic algorithm [1] , tabu search (TS) [20] , linear programming with TS [21] , ant colony optimization [22] , max–min ant system [23] , and particle swarm optimization [6] . However, most of the above methods cannot solve large-scale problems effectively and efficiently. Very recently, Wang et al. [24] proposed a hybrid algorithm based on estimation of distribution algorithm (HEDA) and designed a new repair operator particularly for large-scale problems. Due to the significance of the MKP in academic research and real applications, it is important to develop novel algorithms with satisfactory performances. As a novel evolutionary optimization approach, fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) [25] is inspired by the knowledge from the foraging behavior of fruit flies. The FOA is easy to understand and implement. Some recent applications of the FOA can be found in literature, including financial distress [25] , power load forecasting [26] , web auction logistics service [27] and PID controller tuning [28]  and  [29] . As the traditional FOA was proposed to solve the continuous optimization problem, it operates on the continuous variables. For the discrete optimization problems, such as the MKP, the FOA should be specially designed to operate on the discrete variables, such as encoding scheme and search operators. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research work about the FOA for solving discrete optimization problems. To solve the MKP effectively, we shall propose a binary fruit fly optimization algorithm (bFOA) by considering the specific knowledge of the MKP, especially aiming at solving the large-scale problems. To be specific, solutions are represented as binary strings. The smell-based search process and the local vision-based search process of the traditional FOA are also used in the bFOA to perform exploitation based search. Different from the traditional FOA, a global vision-based search process is designed for the bFOA to enhance the exploration based search. Meanwhile, in the global vision-based search process, the population is generated according to a group generating probability vector, which is updated based on the differential information among fruit flies. In addition, two repair operators are employed to guarantee the feasibility of solutions. The influence of parameter setting is investigated based on the Taguchi method of design of experiment, and suitable values are recommended. Finally, extensive numerical testing results and comparisons are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bFOA. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , the mathematical formulation of the MKP is presented. In Section 3 , the basic FOA is introduced. Then, the bFOA for the MKP is presented in details in Section 4 . In Section 5 , the influence of parameter setting is investigated, and numerical testing results and comparisons are given. Finally, we end the paper with some conclusions and future work in Section 6 .
