An In Silico model to relate the properties of proteins to the structure,
sequence, function and evolutionary history of proteins is shown. The derived
ideal sequences for amino acid residues in proteins can then be considered as
attractors for structures of actual protein families and their functions.
Hopfield networks1 can then act as GCMs (General Content Addressable Memories)
when they are trained to recall unique pre-determined states when presented
with information associated with that state. The tertiary structure of proteins
is determined by structurally enforced interactions between residues and they
help to elucidate common motifs exhibited in proteins. The acceptance (or
rejection) of substitution on the protein backbone conforms to a nonlinear
response and can lead to emergent behavior.
