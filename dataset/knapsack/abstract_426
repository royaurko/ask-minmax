IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks / a Publication of the IEEE Neural Networks Council [1992, 3(2):302-307] 1992/01 Type: Journal Article DOI: 10.1109/72.125871 Gene Ontology (1) A knapsack packing neural network of 4n units with both low-order and conjunctive asymmetric synapses is derived from a non-Hamiltonian energy function. Parallel simulations of randomly generated problems of size n in {5, 10, 20} are used to compare network solutions with those of simple greedy fast parallel enumerative algorithms.
