We consider the linear or quadratic 0/1 program$$\P:\quad f^*=\min\{
\c^T\x+\x^T\F\x : \:\A\,\x =\b;\:\x\in\{0,1\}^n\},$$for some vectors
$\c\in\R^n$, $\b\in\Z^m$, some matrix $\A\in\Z^{m\times n}$and some real
symmetric matrix $\F\in\R^{n\times n}$.We show that $\P$ can be formulated as a
MAX-CUT problemwhose quadratic form criterion is explicit from the data of
$\P$. In particular, to $\P$one may associate a graph $(G,V)$ whose
connectivity is related to the connectivity of the matrix $\F$ and $\A^T\A$,
and $\P$ reduces to finding a maximum (weighted) cut in such a graph.Hence the
whole arsenal of approximation techniques for MAX-CUT can be applied. On a
sample of 0/1 knapsack problems, we compare the lower bound on $f^*$ of the
associated standard (Shor) SDP-relaxation with the standard linear relaxation
where $\{0,1\}^n$ is replaced with $[0,1]^n$ (resulting in an LPwhen $\F=0$ and
a quadratic program when $\F$ is positive definite). We also compare our lower
bound with that of the first SDP-relaxation associated with the copositive
formulation of $\P$.
