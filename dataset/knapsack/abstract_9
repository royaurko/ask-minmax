In this paper, we analyze a knapsack schemes. The one is suggested by Su,
which is relied on a new method entitled permutation combination method. We
demonstrate that this permutation method is useless to the security of the
scheme. Since the special super increasing construction, we can break this
scheme employ the algorithm provided by Shamir scheme. Finally, we provide an
enhanced version of Su scheme to avoid these attacks.
