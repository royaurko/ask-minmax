An input is a sequence of items, u 1 ,..., u i ,... such that 0 < |ui| ≤ 1.0. When u i is given, the on-line player puts it into the bin and can discard any selected items currently in the bin (including u i ) under the condition that the total size of the remaining items is at most one. The goal is to make this total size as close to 1.0 as possible when the game ends. We also discuss the multi-bin model, where the player can select a bin out of the k ones which u i is put into. We prove tight bounds for the competitive ratio of this problem, both for k = 1 and k ≥ 2. supported in part by Scientific Research Grant, Ministry of Japan, No. 13480081.
