  The zero-one multiple knapsack problem is an extension of the zero-one single knapsack problem to the case where several knapsacks have to be filled and each element can be assigned to only one knapsack. This paper presents a branch and bound scheme for the solution of the problem; algorithms are then obtained by utilizing different branching strategies and bounding procedures. The computational performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and comparisons are made with the methods recently proposed by Hung and Fisk [4]. References [1] J.H. Ahrens, G.
