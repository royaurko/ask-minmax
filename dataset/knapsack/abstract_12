We introduce the Funding Game, in which $m$ identical resources are to be
allocated among $n$ selfish agents. Each agent requests a number of resources
$x_i$ and reports a valuation $\tilde{v}_i(x_i)$, which verifiably {\em
lower}-bounds $i$'s true value for receiving $x_i$ items. The pairs $(x_i,
\tilde{v}_i(x_i))$ can be thought of as size-value pairs defining a knapsack
problem with capacity $m$. A publicly-known algorithm is used to solve this
knapsack problem, deciding which requests to satisfy in order to maximize the
social welfare.
  We show that a simple mechanism based on the knapsack {\it highest ratio
greedy} algorithm provides a Bayesian Price of Anarchy of 2, and for the
complete information version of the game we give an algorithm that computes a
Nash equilibrium strategy profile in $O(n^2 \log^2 m)$ time. Our primary
algorithmic result shows that an extension of the mechanism to $k$ rounds has a
Price of Anarchy of $1 + \frac{1}{k}$, yielding a graceful tradeoff between
communication complexity and the social welfare.
