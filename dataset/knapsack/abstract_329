Volume 1671 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 51-62 A Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for the Multiple Knapsack Problem Hans Kellerer Affiliated with Institut für Statistik und Operations Research, Universität Graz The Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) (with equal capacities) can be defined as follows: Given a set of n items with positive integer weights and profits, a subset has to be selected such that the items in this subset can be packed into m knapsacks of equal capacities and such that the total profit of all items in the knapsacks is maximized. For m = 1 (MKP) reduces to the classical 0-1 single knapsack problem. It is known that (MKP) admits no fully polynomial-time approximation scheme even for m = 2 unless  \(\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}\) . In this paper we present a polynomial time approximation scheme for (MKP) even if m is part of the input. This solves an important open problem in the field of knapsack problems.
