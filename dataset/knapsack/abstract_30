In tree search problem the best-first search algorithm needs too much of
space . To remove such drawbacks of these algorithms the IDA* was developed
which is both space and time cost efficient. But again IDA* can give an optimal
solution for real valued problems like Flow shop scheduling, Travelling
Salesman and 0/1 Knapsack due to their real valued cost estimates. Thus further
modifications are done on it and the Iterative Deepening Branch and Bound
Search Algorithms is developed which meets the requirements. We have tried
using this algorithm for the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem and have found that
it is quite effective.
