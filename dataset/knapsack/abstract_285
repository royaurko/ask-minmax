The 0-1 Knapsack Problem -- An Introductory Survey (1996) @TECHREPORT{Lagoudakis96the0-1,     author = {Michail G. Lagoudakis},     title = {The 0-1 Knapsack Problem -- An Introductory Survey },     institution = {},     year = {1996} } Years of Citing Articles The 0-1 Knapsack problem has been studied extensively during the past four decades. The reason is that it appears in many real domains with practical importance. Although its NP-completeness, many algorithms have been proposed that exhibit impressive behavior in the average case. This paper introduces the problem and presents a proof that it belongs to the NP-complete class, as well as a list of directly related problems. An overview of the previous research and the most known algorithms for solving it are presented. The paper concludes with a reference to the practical situations where the problem arises.

So, the implications of the theory can be extended: If the decision problem is proved to be NP-complete, the corresponding optimization problem is NP-hard =-=[GaJo79]-=-. There is an other problem that appears in the literature sometimes with the same name: 0--1 KNAPSACK or SUBSET-SUM. In fact, it is a special case of the problem already described, and asks whether t... 3081 Dynamic Programming - Bellman - 1957 (Show Context) Citation Context ...ll solved problem [GaJo79].
