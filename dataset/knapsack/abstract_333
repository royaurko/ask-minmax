Based on possibilistic programming and stochastic programming, the problem is formulated as a chance constrained programming problem which is to maximize a degree of possibility that the objective function value satisfies a fuzzy goal. After transforming the problem into the deterministic equivalent problem, we propose a polynomial order algorithm using parametric linear programming techniques.
