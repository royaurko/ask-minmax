For each composition $\vec{c}$ we show that the order complex of the poset of
pointed set partitions $\Pi^{\bullet}_{\vec{c}}$ is a wedge of spheres of the
same dimension with the multiplicity given by the number of permutations with
descent composition $\vec{c}$. Furthermore, the action of the symmetric group
on the top homology is isomorphic to the Specht module $S^{B}$ where $B$ is a
border strip associated to the composition. We also study the filter of pointed
set partitions generated by a knapsack integer partition and show the analogous
results on homotopy type and action on the top homology.
