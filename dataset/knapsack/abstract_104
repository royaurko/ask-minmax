We consider a class of algorithms which use the combined powers of branch-and-bound, dynamic programming and rudimentary divisibility arguments for solving the zero-one knapsack problem. Our main result identifies a class of instances of the problem which are difficult to solve by such algorithms. More precisely, if reading the data takes t units of time, then the time required to solve the problem grows exponentially with the square root of t .
