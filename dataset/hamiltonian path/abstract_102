Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points in 3-dimensional space. A tetrahedralization
$\mathcal{T}$ of $S$ is a set of interior disjoint tetrahedra with vertices on
$S$, not containing points of $S$ in their interior, and such that their union
is the convex hull of $S$. Given $\mathcal{T}$, $D_\mathcal{T}$ is defined as
the graph having as vertex set the tetrahedra of $\mathcal{T}$, two of which
are adjacent if they share a face. We say that $\mathcal{T}$ is Hamiltonian if
$D_\mathcal{T}$ has a Hamiltonian path. Let $m$ be the number of convex hull
vertices of $S$. We prove that by adding at most $\lfloor \frac{m-2}{2}
\rfloor$ Steiner points to interior of the convex hull of $S$, we can obtain a
point set that admits a Hamiltonian tetrahedralization. An $O(m^{3/2}) + O(n
\log n)$ time algorithm to obtain these points is given. We also show that all
point sets with at most 20 convex hull points admit a Hamiltonian
tetrahedralization without the addition of any Steiner points. Finally we
exhibit a set of 84 points that does not admit a Hamiltonian tetrahedralization
in which all tetrahedra share a vertex.
