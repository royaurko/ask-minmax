Computing ground states of local Hamiltonians is a fundamental problem in
condensed matter physics. We give the first randomized polynomial-time
algorithm for finding ground states of gapped one-dimensional Hamiltonians: it
outputs an (inverse-polynomial) approximation, expressed as a matrix product
state (MPS) of polynomial bond dimension. The algorithm combines many
ingredients, including recently discovered structural features of gapped 1D
systems, convex programming, insights from classical algorithms for 1D
satisfiability, and new techniques for manipulating and bounding the complexity
of MPS. Our result provides one of the first major classes of Hamiltonians for
which computing ground states is provably tractable despite the exponential
nature of the objects involved.
