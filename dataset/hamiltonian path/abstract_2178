A number of properties of systems in a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) are
investigated by a generalization of the Onsager-Machlup (OM) path integral
approach for systems in an equilibrium state (ES). A thermodynamics formally
identical to that in an ES can be formulated, but with definitions of work and
heat as those needed to maintain the NESS. In this approach, the heat plays a
crucial role and is directly related to the different behavior of a system?s
forward and backward paths in time in an appropriate function space. However,
an ambiguity in the choice of the time- backward path corresponding to a given
time-forward path prevents a unique general formal theory for systems in a
NESS. Unique unambiguous physically acceptable physical results for a system in
a NESS appear to be obtainable only after specifying the physical
nonequilibrium parameters, which define a system in a NESS as part of a larger
system. NESS systems are therefore fundamentally different from those in an ES.
Furthermore, an example is given for a particular system that the fluctuations
of a system in a NESS behave in many respects very differently from those in a
system in an ES.
