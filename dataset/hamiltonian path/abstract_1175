We have given some arguments that a two-dimensional Lorentz-invariant
Hamiltonian may be relevant to the Riemann hypothesis concerning zero points of
the Riemann zeta function. Some eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian corresponding
to infinite-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group have many
interesting properties. Especially, a relationship exists between the zero zeta
function condition and the absence of trivial representations in the wave
function.
