We use Floer homology to study the Hofer-Zehnder capacity of neighborhoods
near a closed symplectic submanifold M of a geometrically bounded and
symplectically aspherical ambient manifold. We prove that, when the unit normal
bundle of M is homologically trivial in degree dim(M) (for example, if codim(M)
> dim(M)), a refined version of the Hofer-Zehnder capacity is finite for all
open sets close enough to M. We compute this capacity for certain tubular
neighborhoods of M by using a squeezing argument in which the algebraic
framework of Floer theory is used to detect nontrivial periodic orbits. As an
application, we partially recover some existence results of Arnold for
Hamiltonian flows which describe a charged particle moving in a nondegenerate
magnetic field on a torus. We also relate our refined capacity to the study of
Hamiltonian paths with minimal Hofer length.
