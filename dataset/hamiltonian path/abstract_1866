Let C be a finite connected graph for which there is a countable universal
C-free graph, and whose tree of blocks is a path. Then the blocks of C are
complete. This generalizes a result of Furedi and Komjath, and fits naturally
into a set of conjectures regarding the existence of countable C-free graphs,
with C an arbitrary finite connected graph.
