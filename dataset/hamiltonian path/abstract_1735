to Tetsuo Asano, showing how to compute the shortest path in a polygon, given
in a read only memory, using sublinear space and subquadratic time.
Specifically, given a simple polygon $\Polygon$ with $n$ vertices in a read
only memory, and additional working memory of size $\Space$, the new algorithm
computes the shortest path (in $\Polygon$) in $O( n^2 /\, \Space )$ expected
time. This requires several new tools, which we believe to be of independent
interest.
