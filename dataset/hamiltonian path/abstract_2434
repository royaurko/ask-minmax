The intertwining technique has been widely used to study the Schr\"odinger
equation and to generate new Hamiltonians with known spectra. This technique
can be adapted to find the bound states of certain Dirac Hamiltonians. In this
paper the system to be solved is a relativistic particle placed in a magnetic
field with cylindrical symmetry whose intensity decreases as the distance to
the symmetry axis grows and its field lines are parallel to the $x-y$ plane. It
will be shown that the Hamiltonian under study turns out to be shape invariant.
