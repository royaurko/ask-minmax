This paper presents an efficient approach for multiplierless implementation
for eight-point DCT approximation, which based on coordinate rotation digital
computer (CORDIC) algorithm. The main design objective is to make critical path
of corresponding circuits shorter and reduce the combinational delay of
proposed scheme.
