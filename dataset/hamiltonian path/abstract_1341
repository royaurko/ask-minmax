We review the canonical quantization of continuum Yang-Mills theory, and
derive the continuum Coulomb-gauge Hamiltonian by a simplification of the
Christ-Lee method. We then analogously derive, by a simple and elementary
method, the lattice Coulomb-gauge Hamiltonian in the minimal Coulomb gauge (and
in other Coulomb gauges) from the known Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian.
