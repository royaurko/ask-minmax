We consider second order differential operators $P$ with polynomial
coefficients that preserve the vector space $V_k$ of polynomials of degrees not
greater then $k$. We assume that the metric associated with the symbol of $P$
is flat and that the operator $P$ is potential. In the case of two independent
variables we obtain some classification results and find polynomial forms for
the elliptic $A_2$ and $G_2$ Calogero-Moser Hamiltonians and for the elliptic
Inosemtsev model.
