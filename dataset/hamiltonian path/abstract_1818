An efficient multigrid Monte-Carlo algorithm for calculating the ground state
of the hydrogen atom using path integral is presented. The algorithm uses a
unigrid approach. The action integral near r=0 is modified so that the correct
values of observables are obtained. It is demonstrated that the critical slow
down (CSD) is eliminated. Finally, the algorithm is compared to the staging
algorithm.
