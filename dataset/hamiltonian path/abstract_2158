Spin-Hall conductivity $\sigma_{{\rm s}xy}$ and orbital susceptibility $\chi$
are investigated for the anisotropic Wolff Hamiltonian, which is an effective
Hamiltonian common to Dirac electrons in solids. It is found that, both for
$\sigma_{{\rm s}xy}$ and $\chi$, the effect of anisotropy appears only in the
prefactors, which is given as the Gaussian curvature of the energy dispersion,
and their functional forms are equivalent to those of the isotropic Wolff
Hamiltonian. As a result, it is revealed that the relationship between the spin
Hall conductivity and the orbital susceptibility in the insulating state,
$\sigma_{{\rm s}xy}=(3mc^2/\hbar e)\chi$, which was firstly derived for the
isotropic Wolff Hamiltonian, is also valid for the anisotropic Wolff
Hamiltonian. Based on this theoretical finding, the magnitude of spin-Hall
conductivity is estimated for bismuth and its alloys with antimony by that of
orbital susceptibility, which has good correspondence between theory and
experiments. The magnitude of spin-Hall conductivity turns out to be as large
as $e\sigma_{{\rm s}xy} \sim 10^4 {\Omega}^{-1}{\rm cm}^{-1}$, which is about
100 times larger than that of Pt.
