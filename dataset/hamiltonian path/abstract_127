Feynman's path integral is herein generalized to the nonextensive canonical
density matrix based on Tsallis entropy. This generalization is done in two
ways by using unnormalized and normalized constraints. Firstly, we consider the
path integral formulation with unnormalized constraints, and this
generalization is worked out through two different ways, which are shown to be
equivalent. These formulations with unnormalized constraints are solutions to
two generalized Bloch equations proposed in this work. The first form of the
generalized Bloch equation is linear, but with a temperature-dependent
effective Hamiltonian; the second form is nonlinear and resembles the anomalous
correlated diffusion equation (porous medium equation). Furthermore, we can
extend these results to the prescription of field theory using integral
representations. The second development is dedicated to analyzing the path
integral formulation with normalized constraints.
  To illustrate the methods introduced here, we analyze the free particle case
and a non-interacting scalar field. The results herein obtained are expected to
be useful in the discussion of generic nonextensive contexts.
