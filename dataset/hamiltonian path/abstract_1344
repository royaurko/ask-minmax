Light-Front (LF) Hamiltonian for QED in (1+1)-dimensions is constructed using
the boson form of this model with additional Pauli-Villars type ultraviolet
regularization. Perturbation theory, generated by this LF Hamiltonian, is
proved to be equivalent to usual covariant chiral perturbation theory. The
obtained LF Hamiltonian depends explicitly on chiral condensate parameters
which enter in a form of some coupling constants.
