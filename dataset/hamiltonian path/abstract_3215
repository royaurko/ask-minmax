I review some of the scientific work of George Papadopoulos in the context of
the Greek cultural tradition and modern theoretical physics. The main emphasis
is on his works on path integrals and their applications. The review is closed
by an excursus on the polaron physics, where the path-integral approach has
been proven to be a method of excellence.
