The classical theorem of Moser, on the existence of a normal form in the
neighbourhood of a hyperbolic equilibrium, is extended to a class of
real-analytic Hamiltonians with aperiodically time-dependent perturbations. A
stronger result is obtained in the case in which the perturbing function
exhibits a time decay.
