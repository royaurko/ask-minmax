We consider the standard message passing model; we assume the system is fully
synchronous: all processes start at the same time and time proceeds in
synchronised rounds. In each round each vertex can transmit a different message
of size $O(1)$ to each of its neighbours. This paper proposes and analyses a
distributed enumeration algorithm of vertices of a graph having a distinguished
vertex which satisfies that two vertices with consecutive numbers are at
distance at most $3$. We prove that its time complexity is $O(n)$ where $n$ is
the number of vertices of the graph. Furthermore, the size of each message is
$O(1)$ thus its bit complexity is also $O(n).$ We provide some links between
this enumeration and Hamiltonian graphs from which we deduce that this
enumeration is optimal in the sense that there does not exist an enumeration
which satisfies that two vertices with consecutive numbers are at distance at
most $2$.
  We deduce from this enumeration algorithms which compute all pairs shortest
paths and the diameter with a time complexity and a bit complexity equal to
$O(n)$. This improves the best known distributed algorithms (under the same
hypotheses) for computing all pairs shortest paths or the diameter presented in
\cite{PRT12,HW12} having a time complexity equal to $O(n)$ and which use
messages of size $O(\log n)$ bits.
