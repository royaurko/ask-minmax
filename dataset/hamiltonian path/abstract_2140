We investigate the vortex bound states both Schrodinger and Dirac Hamiltonian
with the s-wave superconducting pairing gap by solving the mean-field
Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations. The exact vortex bound states spectrum is
numerically determined by the integration method, and also accompanied by the
quasi-classical analysis. It is found that the bound state energies is
proportional to the vortex angular momentum when the chemical potential is
large enough. By applying the external magnetic field, the vortex bound state
energies of the Dirac Hamiltonian are almost unchanged; whereas the energy
shift of the Schrodinger Hamiltonian is proportional to the magnetic field.
These qualitative differences may serve as an indirect evidence of the
existence of Majorana fermions in which the zero mode exists in the case of the
Dirac Hamiltonian only.
