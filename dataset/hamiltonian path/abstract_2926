Within the ideas of pseudo-supersymmetry, we have studied a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian $H_{-}=\omega(\xi^{\dag} \xi+\1/2)+\alpha \xi^{2}+\beta \xi^{\dag
2}$, where $\alpha \neq \beta$ and $\xi$ is a first order differential
operator, to obtain the partner potentials $V_{+}(x)$ and $V_{-}(x)$ which are
new isotonic and isotonic nonlinear oscillators, respectively, as the Hermitian
equivalents of the non-Hermitian partner Hamiltonians $H_{\pm}$. We have
provided an algebraic way to obtain the spectrum and wavefunctions of a
nonlinear isotonic oscillator. The solutions of $V_{-}(x)$ which are Hermitian
counterparts of Swanson Hamiltonian are obtained under some parameter
restrictions that are found. Also, we have checked that if the intertwining
operator satisfies $\eta_{1} H_{-}=H_{+} \eta_{1}$, where $\eta_{1}=\rho^{-1}
\mathcal{A} \rho$ and $\mathcal{A}$ is the first order differential operator,
which factorizes Hermitian equivalents of $H_{\pm}$.
