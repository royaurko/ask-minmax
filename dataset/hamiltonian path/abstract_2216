Many systems near criticality can be described by Hamiltonians involving
several relevant couplings and possessing many nontrivial fixed points. A
simple and physically appealing characterization of the crossover lines and
surfaces connecting different nontrivial fixed points is presented. Generalized
crossover is related to the vanishing of the RG function $Z_t^{-1}$. An
explicit example is discussed in detail based on the tetragonal GLW
Hamiltonian.
