In the framework of polysymplectic Hamiltonian formalism, degenerate
Lagrangian field systems are described as multi-Hamiltonian systems with
Lagrangian constraints. The physically relevant case of degenerate quadratic
Lagrangians is analized in detail, and the Koszul--Tate resolution of
Lagrangian constraints is constructed in an explicit form. The particular case
of Hamiltonian mechanics with time-dependent constraints is studied.
