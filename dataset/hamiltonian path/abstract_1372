A set of factorization energies is introduced, giving rise to a
generalization of the Schr\"{o}dinger (or Infeld and Hull) factorization for
the radial hydrogen-like Hamiltonian. An algebraic intertwining technique
involving such factorization energies leads to derive $n$-parametric families
of potentials in general almost-isospectral to the hydrogen-like radial
Hamiltonians. The construction of SUSY partner Hamiltonians with ground state
energies greater than the corresponding ground state energy of the initial
Hamiltonian is also explicitly performed.
