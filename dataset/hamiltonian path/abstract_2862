We continue the study of time-dependent Hamiltonians with an isolated
singularity in their time dependence, describing propagation on singular
space-times. In previous work, two of us have proposed a "minimal subtraction"
prescription for the simplest class of such systems, involving Hamiltonians
with only one singular term. On the other hand, Hamiltonians corresponding to
geometrical resolutions of space-time tend to involve multiple operator
structures (multiple types of dependence on the canonical variables) in an
essential way.
  We consider some of the general properties of such (near-)singular
Hamiltonian systems, and further specialize to the case of a free scalar field
on a two-parameter generalization of the null-brane space-time. We find that
the singular limit of free scalar field evolution exists for a discrete subset
of the possible values of the two parameters. The coordinates we introduce
reveal a peculiar reflection property of scalar field propagation on the
generalized (as well as the original) null-brane. We further present a simple
family of pp-wave geometries whose singular limit is a light-like hyperplane
(discontinuously) reflecting the positions of particles as they pass through
it.
