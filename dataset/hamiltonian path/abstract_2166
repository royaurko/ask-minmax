Embedding of the 5-dimensional (5D) space of the Bohr Hamiltonian with a
deformation-dependent mass (DDM) into a 6-dimensional (6D) space shows that the
free parameter in the dependence of the mass on the deformation is connected to
the curvature of the 5D space, with the special case of constant mass
corresponding to a flat 5D space. Comparison of the DDM Bohr Hamiltonian to the
5D classical limit of Hamiltonians of the 6D interacting boson model (IBM),
shows that the DDM parameter is proportional to the strength of the pairing
interaction in the U(5) (vibrational) symmetry limit, while it is proportional
to the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction in the SU(3) (rotational) symmetry
limit, and to the difference of the pairing interactions among s, d bosons and
d bosons alone in the O(6) (gamma-soft) limit. The presence of these
interactions leads to a curved 5D space in the classical limit of IBM, in
contrast to the flat 5D space of the original Bohr Hamiltonian, which is made
curved by the introduction of the deformation-dependent mass.
