A Dynamic Programming based polynomial worst case time and space algorithm is
described for computing Hamiltonian Path of a directed graph. Complexity
constructive proofs along with a tested C++ implementation are provided as
well. The result is obtained via the use of original colored hypergraph
structures in order to maintain and update the necessary DP states.
