An effective coherent state path integral for super-symmetric pair
condensates is investigated with specification on the nontrivial coset
integration measure. The nontrivial coset integration measure, determined by
the square root of the super-determinant of the coset metric tensor, is
eliminated by the inverse square root of this coset metric tensor; this results
into Euclidean path integration variables for the pair condensate fields.
According to the transformation to 'flat' anomalous path integration variables,
first order variations of fields can be performed for classical equations with
inclusion of second and higher even order variations for universal fluctuations
determined by the coset metric tensor of the ortho-symplectic super-manifold.
