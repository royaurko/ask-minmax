We revisit an old question: what are the effects of observing stratified
atmospheres on scales below a photon mean free path? The mean free path of
photons emerging from the solar photosphere and chromosphere is near 100 km.
Using current 1m-class telescopes, the mean free path is on the order of the
angular resolution. But the Daniel K. Inoue Solar Telescope will have a
diffraction limit of 0.020'' near the atmospheric cutoff at 310nm,
corresponding to 14 km at the solar surface. Even a small amount of scattering
in the source function leads to physical smearing due to this solar 'fog', with
effects similar to a degradation of the telescope PSF. We discuss a unified
picture that depends simply on the nature and amount of scattering in the
source function. Scalings are derived from which the scattering in the solar
atmosphere can be transcribed into an effective Strehl ratio, a quantity useful
to observers. Observations in both permitted (e.g., Fe I 630.2 nm) and
forbidden (Fe I 525.0 nm) lines will shed light on both instrumental
performance as well as on small scale structures in the solar atmosphere.
