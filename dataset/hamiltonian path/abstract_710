We show that the main theorem of Morales--Ramis--Simo about Galoisian
obstructions to meromorphic integrability of Hamiltonian systems can be
naturally extended to the non-Hamiltonian case. Namely, if a dynamical system
is meromorphically integrable in the non-Hamiltonian sense, then the
differential Galois groups of the variational equations (of any order) along
its solutions must be virtually Abelian
