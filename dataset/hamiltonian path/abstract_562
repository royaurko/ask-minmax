Being chosen as a differential operator of a special form, metric $\eta$
operator becomes unitary equivalent to a one-dimensional Hermitian Hamiltonian
with a natural supersymmetric structure. We show that fixing the superpartner
of this Hamiltonian permits to determine both the metric operator and
corresponding non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Moreover, under an additional
restriction on the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, it becomes a superpartner of
another Hermitian Hamiltonian.
