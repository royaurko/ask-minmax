The path integral of a gauge theory is studied in Coulomb-like gauges. The
Christ-Lee terms of operator ordering are reproduced {\it{within}} the path
integration framework. In the presence of fermions, a new operator term, in
addition to that of Christ-Lee, is discovered. Such kind of terms is found to
be instrumental in restoring the invariance of the effective Lagrangian under a
field dependent gauge transformation, which underlies the BRST symmetry. A
unitary regularization scheme which maintains manifest BRST symmetry and is
free from energy divergences is proposed for a nonabelian gauge field.
