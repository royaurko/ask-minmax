We give a simple physical derivation of the photon emission rate from the
weakly coupled quark-gluon plasma connected with the collinear processes $q\to
\gamma q$ and $q\bar{q}\to \gamma$. The analysis is based on the light-cone
path integral approach to the induced radiation. Our results agree with that by
Arnold, Moore and Yaffe obtained using the real-time thermal perturbation
theory. It is demonstrated that the solution of the AMY integral equation is
nothing but the time-integrated Green's function of the light-cone path
integral approach written in the momentum representation.
