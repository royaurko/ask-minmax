We study inheritance of path-pairability in the Cartesian product of graphs,
and prove di?erent (such as additive and multiplicative) inheritance patterns
of path-pairability, depending on the size of the Cartesian product. We present
path-pairable graph families, that improve the known upper bound on the minimal
maximum degree of a path-pairable graph. Further results and open questions
about path-pairability are also presented.
