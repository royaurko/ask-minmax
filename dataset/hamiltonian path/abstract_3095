Nature might be kinder than previously thought as far as epsilon'/epsilon is
concerned. We show that the recently obtained experimental value for
epsilon'/epsilon does not require sizeable 1/N and isospin-breaking
corrections. We propose to display the theoretical results for epsilon'/epsilon
in a (P^{1/2}, P^{3/2}) plane in which the experimental result is represented
by a (epsilon'/epsilon)_exp-path. This should allow to exhibit transparently
the role of 1/N and isospin-breaking corrections in different calculations of
epsilon'/epsilon. From now on theorists are allowed to walk only along this
(epsilon'/epsilon)_exp-path.
