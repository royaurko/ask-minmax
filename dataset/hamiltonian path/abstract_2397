We propose a unified realistic shell-model Hamiltonian employing the pairing
plus multipole Hamiltonian combined with the monopole interaction constructed
starting from the monopole-based universal force by Otsuka it et al. (Phys.
Rev. Lett. 104, 012501 (2010)). It is demonstrated that the proposed PMMU model
can consistently describe a large amount of spectroscopic data as well as
binding energies in the pf and pf5/2g9/2 shell spaces, and could serve as a
practical shell model for even heavier mass regions.
