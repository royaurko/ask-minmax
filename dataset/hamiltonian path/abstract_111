We use the criteria of Lalonde and McDuff to determine a new class of
examples of length minimizing paths in the group $Ham(M)$. For a compact
symplectic manifold $M$ of dimension two or four, we show that a path in
$Ham(M)$, generated by an autonomous Hamiltonian and starting at the identity,
which induces no non-constant closed trajectories of points in $M$, is length
minimizing among homotopic paths. The major step in the proof involves
determining an upper bound for the Hofer-Zehnder capacity for symplectic
manifolds of the type $(M \times D(a))$ where $M$ is compact and has dimension
two or four. In the appendix, we give an alternate proof of Polterovich's
result that rotation in $CP^2$ and in the blow-up of $CP^2$ at one point is a
length minimizing path with respect to the Hofer norm. Here we use the Gromov
capacity and describe the necessary ball embeddings.
