Affine hamiltonians are defined in the paper and their study is based
especially on the fact that in the hyperregular case they are dual objects of
lagrangians defined on affine bundles, by mean of natural Legendre maps. The
variational problems for affine hamiltonians and lagrangians of order $k\geq 2$
are studied, relating them to a Hamilton equation. An Ostrogradski type theorem
is proved: the Hamilton equation of an affine familtonian $h$ is equivalent
with Euler-Lagrange equation of its dual lagrangian $L$. Zermelo condition is
also studied and some non-trivial examples are given.
