Large-amplitude molecular motions which occur during isomerization can cause
significant changes in electronic structure. These variations in electronic
properties can be used to identify vibrationally-excited eigenstates which are
localized along the potential energy surface. This work demonstrates that
nuclear quadrupole hyperfine interactions can be used as a diagnostic marker of
progress along the isomerization path in both the HC14N/H14NC and DC15N/D15NC
chemical systems. Ab initio calculations at the CCSD(T)/cc-pCVQZ level indicate
that the hyperfine interaction is extremely sensitive to the chemical bonding
of the quadrupolar 14N nucleus and can therefore be used to determine in which
potential well the vibrational wavefunction is localized. A natural bonding
orbital analysis along the isomerization path further demonstrates that
hyperfine interactions arise from the asphericity of the electron density at
the quadrupolar nucleus. Using the CCSD(T) potential surface, the quadrupole
coupling constants of highly-excited vibrational states are computed from a
one-dimensional internal coordinate path Hamiltonian. The excellent agreement
between ab initio calculations and recent measurements demonstrates that
nuclear quadrupole hyperfine structure can be used as a diagnostic tool for
characterizing localized HCN and HNC vibrational states.
