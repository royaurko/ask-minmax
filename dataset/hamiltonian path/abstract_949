We study separating systems of the edges of a graph where each member of the
separating system is a path. We conjecture that every graph on n vertices
admits a separating path system of size linear in n and prove this in certain
interesting special cases. In particular, we establish this conjecture for
random graphs and graphs with linear minimum degree. We also obtain tight
bounds on the size of a minimal separating path system in the case of trees.
