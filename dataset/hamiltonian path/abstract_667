In this paper we propose the time & fitness-dependent Hamiltonian form of
human biomechanics, in which total mechanical + biochemical energy is not
conserved. Starting with the Covariant Force Law, we first develop autonomous
Hamiltonian biomechanics. Then we extend it using a powerful geometrical
machinery consisting of fibre bundles, jet manifolds, polysymplectic geometry
and Hamiltonian connections. In this way we derive time-dependent dissipative
Hamiltonian equations and the fitness evolution equation for the general time &
fitness-dependent human biomechanical system.
