We present results of magnetization measurements showing that the magnetic
response of the antiferromagnetic state of SmMn_2Ge_2 depends on the path used
in the field(H)-temperature(T) phase space to reach this state. Distinct
signature of metastablity is observed in this antiferromagnetic state when
obtained via field-cooling/field-warming paths. The isothermal M-H loops show
lack of end-point memory, reminiscent of that seen in metastable vortex states
near the field-induced first order phase transition in various type-II
superconductors.
