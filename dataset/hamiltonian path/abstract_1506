We establish the Hamiltonian formulation of the teleparallel equivalent of
general relativity, without fixing the time gauge condition, by rigorously
performing the Legendre transform. The time gauge condition, previously
considered, restricts the teleparallel geometry to the three-dimensional
spacelike hypersurface. Geometrically, the teleparallel geometry is now
extended to the four-dimensional space-time. The resulting Hamiltonian
formulation is different from the standard ADM formulation in many aspects, the
main one being that the dynamics is now governed by the Hamiltonian constraint
H_0 and a set of primary constraints. The vector constraint H_i is derived from
the Hamiltonian constraint. The vanishing of the latter implies the vanishing
of the vector constraint.
