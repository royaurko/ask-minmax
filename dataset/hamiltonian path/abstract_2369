We test the applicability of the Bohigas conjecture to systems whose
Hamiltonian is not written as a closed form analytic expression. A class of
such Hamiltonians is created and appear to violate the conjecture. Numerical
methods are employed to find the spectra of a two-dimensional, classically
chaotic "billiard" system whose Hamiltonian is in this class. We find that the
spectral fluctuations are not in agreement with the conjecture.
