We develop simple rules for performing integrals over products of
distributions in coordinate space. Such products occur in perturbation
expansions of path integrals in curvilinear coordinates, where the interactions
contain terms of the form dot q^2 q^n, which give rise to highly singular
Feynman integrals. The new rules ensure the invariance of perturbatively
defined path integrals under coordinate transformations.
