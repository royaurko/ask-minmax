Optimal-control techniques and a fast-approach scheme are used to implement a
collisional control phase gate in a model of cold atoms in an optical lattice,
significantly reducing the gate time as compared to adiabatic evolution while
maintaining high fidelity. New objective functionals are given for which
optimal paths are obtained for evolution that yields a control-phase gate up to
single-atom Rabi shifts. Furthermore, the fast-approach procedure is used to
design a path to significantly increase the fidelity of non-adiabatic transport
in a recent experiment. Also, the entanglement power of phase gates is
quantified.
