Path and path deviation equations for neutral, charged, spinning and spinning
charged test particles, using a modified Bazanski Lagrangian, are derived. We
extend this approach to strings and branes. We show how the Bazanski Lagrangian
for charged point particles and charged branes arises `a la Kaluza-Klein from
the Bazanski Lagrangian in 5-dimensions.
