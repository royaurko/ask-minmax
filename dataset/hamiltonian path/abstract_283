A numerical algorithm for studying strongly correlated electron systems is
proposed. The groundstate wavefunction is projected out after numerical
renormalization procedure in the path integral formalism. The wavefunction is
expressed from the optimized linear combination of retained states in the
truncated Hilbert space with numerically chosen basis. This algorithm does not
suffer from the negative sign problem and can be applied to any type of
Hamiltonian in any dimension. The efficiency is tested in examples of the
Hubbard model where the basis of Slater determinants is numerically optimized.
We show results on fast convergence and accuracy achieved with small number of
retained states.
