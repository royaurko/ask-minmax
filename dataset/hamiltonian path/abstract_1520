It is shown that for a given Hermitian Hamiltonian possessing supersymmetry,
there is alwayas a non-hermitian Jaynes-Cummings-type Hamiltonian(JCTH)
admitting entirely real spectra. The parent supersymmetric Hamiltonian and the
corresponding non-hermitian JCTH are simultaneously diagonalizable. The exact
eigenstates of these non-hermitian Hamiltonians are constructed algebraically
for certain shape-invariant potentials, including a non-hermitian version of
the standard Jaynes-Cummings model for which the parent supersymmetric
Hamiltonian is the superoscillator. The positive-definite metric operator in
the Hilbert space is constructed explicitly along with the introduction of a
new inner product structure, so that the eigenstates form a complete set of
orthonormal vectors and the time-evolution is unitary.
