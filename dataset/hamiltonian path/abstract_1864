Some parts of stochastic analysis on curved spaces are revisted. A concise
proof of the quasi-invariance of the Wiener measure on the path spaces over a
Riemannian manifold is presented. The shifts are allowed to be in the
Cameron-Martin space and random. The second part of the paper presents some
remarks on the anticipative integrals on Riemannian manifolds.
