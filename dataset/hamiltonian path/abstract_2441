A non-Hermitian generalized oscillator model, generally known as the Swanson
model, has been studied in the framework of R-deformed Heisenberg algebra. The
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is diagonalized by generalized Bogoliubov
transformation. A set of deformed creation annihilation operators is introduced
whose algebra shows that the transformed Hamiltonian has conformal symmetry.
The spectrum is obtained using algebraic technique. The superconformal
structure of the system is also worked out in detail. An anomaly related to the
spectrum of the Hermitian counterpart of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with
generalized ladder operators is shown to occur and is discussed in position
dependent mass scenario.
