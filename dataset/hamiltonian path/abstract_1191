We show that the Gaudin Hamiltonians H_1,...,H_n generate the Bethe algebra
of the n-fold tensor power of the vector representation of gl_N. Surprisingly
the formula for the generators of the Bethe algebra in terms of the Gaudin
Hamiltonians does not depend on N. Moreover, this formula coincides with
Wilson's formula for the stationary Baker-Akhiezer function on the adelic
Grassmannian.
