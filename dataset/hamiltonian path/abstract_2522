By considering the enlarged thermal system including the heat bath, it is
shown that this system has supersymmetry which is not broken at finite
temperature. The super algebra is constructed and the Hamiltonian is expressed
as the anti-commutator of two kinds of super charges. With this Hamiltonian and
the thermal vacuum $\mid 0(\beta)>$, this supersymmetry is found to be
preserved.
