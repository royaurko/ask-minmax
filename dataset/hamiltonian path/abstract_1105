Hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type occur in a wide range of
applications including fluid dynamics, the Whitham averaging procedure and the
theory of Frobenius manifolds. In 1+1 dimensions, the requirement of the
integrability of such systems by the generalised hodograph transform implies
that integrable Hamiltonians depend on a certain number of arbitrary functions
of two variables. On the contrary, in 2+1 dimensions the requirement of the
integrability by the method of hydrodynamic reductions, which is a natural
analogue of the generalised hodograph transform in higher dimensions, leads to
finite-dimensional moduli spaces of integrable Hamiltonians. In this paper we
classify integrable two-component Hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type for
all existing classes of differential-geometric Poisson brackets in 2D,
establishing a parametrisation of integrable Hamiltonians via
elliptic/hypergeometric functions. Our approach is based on the Godunov-type
representation of Hamiltonian systems, and utilises a novel construction of
Godunov's systems in terms of generalised hypergeometric functions.
