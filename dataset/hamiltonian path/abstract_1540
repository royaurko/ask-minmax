The evolution of a large class of biological, physical and engineering
systems can be studied through both dynamical systems theory and Hamiltonian
mechanics. The former theory, in particular its specialization to study systems
with symmetry, is already well developed and has been used extensively on a
wide variety of spatio-temporal systems. There are, however, fewer results on
higher-dimensional Hamiltonian systems with symmetry. This lack of results has
lead us to investigate the role of symmetry, in particular dihedral symmetry,
on high-dimensional coupled Hamiltonian systems. As a representative example,
we consider the model equations of a ring of vibratory gyroscopes. The
equations are reformulated in a Hamiltonian structure and the corresponding
normal forms are derived. Through a normal form analysis, we investigated the
effects of various coupling schemes and unraveled the nature of the
bifurcations that lead the ring of gyroscopes into and out of synchronization.
The Hamiltonian approach is specially useful in investigating the collective
behavior of small and large ring sizes and it can be readily extended to other
symmetry-related systems.
