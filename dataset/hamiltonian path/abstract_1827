All objects in 4D spacetime may in principle travel on null paths in a 5D
mani-fold. We use this, together with a change in the extra coordinate and the
signature of the metric, to construct a simple model of a classical universe
and a quantized particle. There are notable implications for the Weak
Equivalence Principle and the cosmological constant, and for astrophysics.
