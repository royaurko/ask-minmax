Primitive path analysis algorithms are now routinely employed to analyze
entanglements in computer simulations of polymeric systems, but different
analysis protocols result in different estimates of the entanglement length,
N_e. Here we argue that standard PPA measures the rheological entanglement
length, typically employed by tube models and relevant to quantitative
comparisons with experiment, while codes like Z or CReTA also determine the
topological entanglement length. For loosely entangled systems, a simple
analogy between between phantom networks and the mesh of entangled primitive
paths suggests a factor of two between the two numbers. This result is in
excellent agreement with reported values for poly-ethylene, poly-butadiene and
bead-spring polymer melts.
