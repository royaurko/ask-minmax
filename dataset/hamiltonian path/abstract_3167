We develop a theory of graph C*-algebras using path groupoids and inverse
semigroups. Row finiteness is not assumed so that the theory applies to graphs
for which there are vertices emitting a countably infinite set of edges. We
show that the path groupoid is amenable, and give a groupoid proof of a recent
theorem of Szymanski characterizing when a graph C*-algebra is simple.
