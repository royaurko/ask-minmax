The main result asserts the existence of noncontractible periodic orbits for
compactly supported time dependent Hamiltonian systems on the unit cotangent
bundle of the torus or of a negatively curved manifold whenever the generating
Hamiltonian is sufficiently large over the zero section. The proof is based on
Floer homology and on the notion of a relative symplectic capacity.
Applications include results about propagation properties of sequential
Hamiltonian systems, periodic orbits on hypersurfaces, Hamiltonian circle
actions, and smooth Lagrangian skeletons in Stein manifolds.
