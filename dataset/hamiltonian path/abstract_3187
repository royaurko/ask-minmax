An L2 theory of differential forms is proposed for the Banach manifold of
continuous paths on Riemannian manifolds M furnished with its Brownian motion
measure. Differentiation must be restricted to certain Hilbert space
directions, the H-tangent vectors. To obtain a closed exterior differential
operator the relevant spaces of differential forms, the H-forms, are perturbed
by the curvature of M. A Hodge decomposition is given for L2 H-one-forms, and
the structure of H-two -forms is described. The dual operator d* is analysed in
terms of a natural connection on the H-tangent spaces. Malliavin calculus is a
basic tool.
