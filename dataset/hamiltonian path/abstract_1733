We improve by an exponential factor the lower bound of Korner and Muzi for
the cardinality of the largest family of Hamilton paths in a complete graph of
n vertices in which the union of any two paths has degree 4. The improvement is
through an explicit construction while the previous bound was obtained by a
greedy algorithm. We solve a similar problem for permutations up to an
exponential factor.
