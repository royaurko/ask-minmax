In our previous paper \cite{ETZ1}, we have introduced a notion of viscosity
solutions for path-dependent fully nonlinear PDEs, extending the semilinear
case of \cite{EKTZ}, which satisfies a partial comparison result under standard
Lipshitz-type assumptions. The main result of this paper provides a full
wellposedness result under an additional assumption formulated on some partial
differential equation defined locally by freezing the path. Namely, assuming
further that such path-frozen standard PDEs satisfy the comparison principle
and the Perron approach for existence, we prove that the path-dependent
nonlinear PDE has a unique viscosity solution. Uniqueness is implied by a
comparison result.
