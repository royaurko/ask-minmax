In this paper we study the convergence of the numerical path integration
method which produces approximate probability density functions for the
solutions of stochastic differential equations. This method enjoys several
advantages compared to path-wise approximation schemes. We prove that the
approximate probability densities converge strongly in L^1 to the probability
density of the stochastic differential equation, uniformly in any finite time
interval. The concept of dissipative operators and semigroup techniques are
used to prove the convergence result. On the way we obtain a generation result
that in itself is new for elliptic operators with unbounded coefficients.
