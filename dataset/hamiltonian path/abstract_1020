A study of Hamiltonian structures associated with supersymmetric Lax
operators is presented. Following a constructive approach, the Hamiltonian
structures of Inami-Kanno super KdV hierarchy and constrained modified super KP
hierarchy are investigated from the reduced supersymmetric Gelfand-Dickey
brackets. By applying a gauge transformation on the Hamiltonian structures
associated with these two nonstandard super Lax hierarchies, we obtain the
Hamiltonian structures of generalized Manin-Radul super KdV and constrained
super KP hierarchies. We also work out a few examples and compare them with the
known results.
