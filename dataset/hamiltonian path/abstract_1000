We investigate perturbed Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom by
renormalization group method, which derives a reduced equation called
renormalization group equation (RGE) by handling secular terms. We found that
RGE is not always a Hamiltonian system. The necessary and sufficient condition
that RGE becomes a Hamiltonian system up to the second leading order of a small
parameter is that the original system is separable by Cartesian coordinates.
 Moreover, RGE is integrable when it is a Hamiltonian system. These statements
are partial generalizations of our previous paper.
