A lattice-path description of $K$-restricted jagged partitions is presented.
The corresponding lattice paths can have peaks only at even $x$ coordinate and
the maximal value of the height cannot be larger than $K-1$. Its weight is
twice that of the corresponding jagged partitions. The equivalence is
demonstrated at the level of generating functions. A bijection is given between
$K$-restricted jagged partitions and partitions restricted by the following
frequencies conditions: $f_{2j-1}$ is even and $f_j+f_{j+1}\leq K-1$, where
$f_j$ is the number of occurrences of the part $j$ in the partition. Bijections
are given between paths and these restricted partitions and between paths and
partitions with successive ranks in a prescribed interval.
