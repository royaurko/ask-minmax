The Hamiltonian treatment of constrained systems in $G\ddot{u}ler's$
formalism leads us to the total differential equations in many variables. These
equations are integrable if the corresponding system of partial differential
equations is a Jacobi system. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the
quantization of the finite dimensional systems with constraints using the
canonical formalism introduced by $G\ddot{u}ler$. This approach is applied for
two systems with constraints and the results are in agreement with those
obtained by Dirac's canonical quatization method and path integral quantization
method.
