A new form of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization is given of the motion of
guiding center in strong magnetic field. This is obtained by the effective
action for the degree of guiding center which is deduced from the coherent
state path integral for the two types of motion under the mutual interaction;
the cyclotron motion and the motion of guiding center.
