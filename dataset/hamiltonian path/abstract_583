We first briefly review the role of lattice paths in the derivation of
fermionic expressions for the M(p,p') minimal model characters of the Virasoro
Lie algebra. We then focus on the recently introduced half-lattice paths for
the M(p,2p+/-1) characters, reformulating them in such a way that the two cases
may be treated uniformly. That the generating functions of these half-lattice
paths are indeed M(p,2p+/-1) characters is proved by describing weight
preserving bijections between them and the corresponding RSOS lattice paths.
Here, the M(p,2p-1) case is derived for the first time. We then apply the
methods of Bressoud and Warnaar to these half-lattice paths to derive fermionic
expressions for the Virasoro characters X^{p,2p+/-1}_{1,2} that differ from
those obtained from the RSOS paths.
  This work is an extension of that presented by the third contributor at the "7th
International Conference on Lattice Path Combinatorics and Applications",
Siena, Italy, July 2010.
