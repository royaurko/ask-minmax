We investigate a suggested path to self-organized criticality. Originally,
this path was devised to "generate criticality" in systems displaying an
absorbing-state phase transition, but closer examination of the mechanism
reveals that it can be used for any continuous phase transition. We used the
Ising model as well as the Manna model to demonstrate how the finite-size
scaling exponents depend on the tuning of driving and dissipation rates with
system size.Our findings limit the explanatory power of the mechanism to
non-universal critical behavior.
