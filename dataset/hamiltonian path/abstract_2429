In this paper we consider random Hamiltonians defined on long-range
percolation graphs over $\ZZ^d$. The Hamiltonian consists of a randomly
weighted Laplacian plus a random potential. We prove uniform existence of the
integrated density of states and express the IDS using a Pastur-Shubin trace
formula.
