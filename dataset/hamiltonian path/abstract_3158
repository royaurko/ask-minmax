We study the phase transition in the honeycomb dimer model (equivalently,
monotone non-intersecting lattice path model). At the critical point the system
has a strong long-range dependence; in particular, periodic boundary conditions
give rise to a ``resonance'' phenomenon, where the partition function and other
properties of the system depend sensitively on the shape of the domain.
