This is the first of two articles devoted to the analysis of the path
description of the states in su(2)_k WZW models, a representation well suited
for constructive derivations of the fermionic characters. In this first
article, the cases k=1,2 are treated in detail, emphasizing a different
description in each case (operators vs particles). For k=1, we first prove, as
a side result, the equivalence of two known path representations for the
finitized su(2)_1 states by displaying an explicit bijection. An immediate
offshoot is the gain of a new and simple weighting for the (Kyoto) path
representation that generalizes to level k. The bijection also suggests two
operator constructions for the su(2)_1 paths, a local and a nonlocal one, both
interrelated. These are formal operators that map a path to another path, so
that any path can be obtained by successive applications of these operators on
a simple reference (ground-state) path. The nonlocal operator description is
the starting point for a direct and elementary derivation of the su(2)_1 spinon
character. The second part presents an extensive study of the su(2)_2 paths
from their particle point of view, where the particles are defined as the path
building blocks. The resulting generating functions appear to provide new (at
least superficially) fermionic forms of the characters. In particular, a nice
relationship between the sum of the j=0,1 characters at k=2 and the two ones at
k=1 is unravelled.
