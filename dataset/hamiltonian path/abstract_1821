A theory of differential equations driven by a non-differentiable path has
recently been developed by Lyons. We develop an alternative approach to this
theory, using (modified Euler approximations), and investigate its
applicability to stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motion.
We also give some other examples showing that the main results are reasonably
sharp.
