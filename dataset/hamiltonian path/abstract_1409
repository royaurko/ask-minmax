This paper deals with multiplicity of rotation type solutions for Hamiltonian
systems on $T^\ell\times \mathbb{R}^{2n-\ell}$. It is proved that, for every
spatially periodic Hamiltonian system, i.e., the case $\ell=n$, there exist at
least $n+1$ geometrically distinct rotation type solutions with given energy
rotation vector. It is also proved that, for a class of Hamiltonian systems on
$T^\ell\times\mathbb{R}^{2n-\ell}$ with $1\leqslant\ell\leqslant 2n-1$ but
$\ell\neq n$, there exists at least one periodic solution or $n+1$ rotation
type solutions on every contact energy hypersurface.
