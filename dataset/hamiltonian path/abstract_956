We extend the notion of viscosity solutions for path-dependent PDEs
introduced by Ekren et al. [Ann. Probab. 42 (2014), no. 1, 204-236] to
path-dependent integro-differential equations and establish well-posedness,
i.e., existence, uniqueness, and stability, for a class of semilinear
path-dependent integro-differential equations with uniformly continuous data.
Closely related are non-Markovian backward SDEs with jumps, which provide a
probabilistic representation for solutions of our equations. The results are
potentially useful for applications using non-Markovian jump-diffusion models.
