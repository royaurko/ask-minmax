We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a cubic graph to be
Hamiltonian by analyzing Eulerian tours in certain spanning subgraphs of the
quartic graph associated with the cubic graph by 1-factor contraction. This
correspondence is most useful in the case when it induces a blue and red
2-factorization of the associated quartic graph. We use this condition to
characterize the Hamiltonian I-graphs, a further generalization of generalized
Petersen graphs. The characterization of Hamiltonian I-graphs follows from the
fact that one can choose a 1-factor in any I-graph in such a way that the
corresponding associated quartic graph is a graph bundle having a cycle graph
as base graph and a fiber and the fundamental factorization of graph bundles
playing the role of blue and red factorization. The techniques that we develop
allow us to represent Cayley multigraphs of degree 4, that are associated to
abelian groups, as graph bundles. Moreover, we can find a family of connected
cubic (multi)graphs that contains the family of connected I-graphs as a
subfamily.
