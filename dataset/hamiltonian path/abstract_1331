Starting from the Fock space representation of hadron bound states in a quark
model, a change of representation is implemented by a unitary transformation
such that the composite hadrons are redescribed by elementary-particle field
operators. Application of the unitary transformation to the microscopic quark
Hamiltonian gives rise to effective hadron-hadron, hadron-quark, and
quark-quark Hamiltonians. An effective baryon Hamiltonian is derived using a
simple quark model. The baryon Hamiltonian is free of the post-prior
discrepancy which usually plagues composite-particle effective interactions.
