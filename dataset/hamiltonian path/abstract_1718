This paper considers the Fokker-Planck equation and path integral formulation
of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process parametrized by two indices. The
effective Fokker-Planck equation of this process is derived from the associated
fractional Langevin equation. Path integral representation of the process is
constructed and the basic quantities are evaluated.
