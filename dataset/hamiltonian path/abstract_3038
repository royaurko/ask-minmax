Path integral techniques and Green functions formalism are applied to study
the (time) temperature dependent scattering of a polaronic quasiparticle by a
local anharmonic potential in a bath of diatomic molecules. The electrical
resistivity has been computed in any molecular lattice dimensionality for
different values of electron-phonon coupling and intermolecular forces. A broad
resistivity peak with non metallic behavior at temperatures larger than $\simeq
100K$ is predicted by the model for sufficiently strong polaron-local potential
coupling strengths. This peculiar behavior, ascribed to purely structural
effects, is favoured in low dimensionality.
