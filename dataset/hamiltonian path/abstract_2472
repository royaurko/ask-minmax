We calculate the eigenvalues of some two-dimensional non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians by means of a pseudospectral method and straightforward
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix in a suitable basis set. Both sets of
results agree remarkably well but differ considerably from the eigenvalues
obtained some time ago by other contributors. In particular, we do not observe the
multiple phase transitions claimed to occur in one of the anharmonic
oscillators.
