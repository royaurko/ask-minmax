We reinterpret a path describing a state in an irreducible module of the
unitary minimal model M(k+1,k+2) in terms of a string of charged operators
acting on the module's ground-state path. Each such operator acts non-locally
on a path. The path characteristics are then translated into a set of
conditions on sequences of operators that provide an operator basis. As an
application, we re-derive the vacuum finite fermionic character by constructing
the generating function of these basis states.
  These results generalize directly to the M(k+1,2k+3) models, the close
relatives of the unitary models in terms of path description.
