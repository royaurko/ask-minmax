In sharp contrast to the Abrams-Rangaswamy Theorem that the only von Neumann
regular Leavitt path algebras are exactly those associated to acyclic graphs,
here we prove that the Leavitt path algebra of any arbitrary graph is a graded
von Neumann regular ring. Several properties of Leavitt path algebras, such as
triviality of the Jacobson radical, flatness of graded modules and finitely
generated graded right (left) ideals being generated by an idempotent element,
follow as a consequence of general theory of grade von Neumann regular rings.
