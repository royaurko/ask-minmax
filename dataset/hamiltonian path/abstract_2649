We study a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions on a kagome lattice
at 1/3 filling, with interactions described by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian.
An effective Hamiltonian in the desired strong correlation regime is derived,
from which the spectral functions are calculated by means of exact
diagonalization techniques. We present our numerical results with a view to
discussion of possible signatures of confinement/deconfinement of fractional
charges.
