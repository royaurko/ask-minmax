An isometric path between two vertices in a graph G is a shortest path
joining them. The isometric-path number of G, denoted by ip(G), is the minimum
number of isometric paths required to cover all vertices of G. In this paper,
we determine exact values of isometric-path numbers of block graphs. We also
give a linear-time algorithm for finding the corresponding paths.
