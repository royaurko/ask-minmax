High order energy-preserving methods for Hamiltonian systems are presented.
For this aim, an energy-preserving condition of continuous stage Runge--Kutta
methods is proved. Order conditions are simplified and parallelizable
conditions are also given. The computational cost of our high order methods is
comparable to that of the average vector field method of order two.
