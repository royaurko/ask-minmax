The path integral approach is used for the calculation of the correlation
functions of the $XY$ Heisenberg chain. The obtained answers for the two-point
correlators of the $XX$ magnet are of the determinantal form and are
interpreted in terms of the generating functions for the random turns vicious
walkers.
