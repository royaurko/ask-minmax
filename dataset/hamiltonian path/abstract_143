It is demonstrated that the reaction path for a polyatomic molecule (applied
to the HCO molecule) is easily calculated via ab-initio configuration
interaction (CI) total energies. This Hamiltonian not only reproduces the CI
calculations accurately and efficiently, but also effectively corrects any CI
energies happening to erroneously converge to excited states.
