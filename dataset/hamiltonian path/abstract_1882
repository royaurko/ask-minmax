We develop a Malliavin calculus on the horizontal path space of a totally
geodesic Riemannian foliation. As a first application, under suitable
assumptions, we prove a log-Sobolev inequality for a natural one-parameter
family of infinite-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type operators. As a second
application, we obtain concentration and tail estimates for the horizontal
Brownian motion of the foliation.
