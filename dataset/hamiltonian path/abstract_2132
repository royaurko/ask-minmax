We derive the post-Newtonian next-to-leading order conservative spin-orbit
and spin(a)-spin(b) gravitational interaction Hamiltonians for arbitrary many
compact objects. The spin-orbit Hamiltonian completes the knowledge of
Hamiltonians up to and including 2.5PN for the general relativistic three-body
problem. The new Hamiltonians include highly nontrivial three-body
interactions, in contrast to the leading order consisting of two-body
interactions only. This may be important for the study of effects like Kozai
resonances in mergers of black holes with binary black holes.
