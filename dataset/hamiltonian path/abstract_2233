The transformation properties of the gravitational energy-momentum in the
teleparallel gravity are analyzed. It is proved that the gravitational
energy-momentum in the teleparallel gravity can be expressed in terms of the
Lorentz gauge potential, and therefore is not covariant under local Lorentz
transformations. On the other hand, it can also be expressed in terms of the
translation gauge field strength, and therefore is covariant under general
coordinate transformations. A simplified Hamiltonian formulation of the
teleparallel gravity is given. Its constraint algebra has the same structure as
that of general relativity, which indicates the equivalence between the
teleparallel gravity and general relativity in the Hamiltonian formulation.
