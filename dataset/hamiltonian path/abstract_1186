It is shown that sl(2,$\mathbb{C}$) Euler-Arnold tops are equivalent to the
two-body systems of Calogero-Moser type. We prove that generic Hamiltonians of
sl(2,$\mathbb{C}$) tops are equivalent to one of three canonical Hamiltonians.
For all canonical Hamiltonians the corresponding two-body system is found.
Bosonisation formulas for each case are obtained explicitly. Relations with
Antonov-Zabrodin-Hasegawa R-matrix are discussed.
