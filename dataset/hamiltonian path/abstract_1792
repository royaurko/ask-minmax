The covariant path integral for chiral bosons obtained by McClain, Wu and Yu
is generalized to chiral p-forms. In order to handle the reducibility of the
gauge transformations associated with the chiral p-forms and with the new
variables (in infinite number) that must be added to eliminate the second class
constraints, the field-antifield formalism is used.
