We discuss from a bi-Hamiltonian point of view the Hamilton-Jacobi
separability of a few dynamical systems. They are shown to admit, in their
natural phase space, a quasi-bi-Hamiltonian formulation of Pfaffian type. This
property allows us to straightforwardly recover a set of separation variables
for the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
