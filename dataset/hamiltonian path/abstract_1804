We derive a curvature-variation formula for a path of left-invariant metrics
on a compact Lie group, beginning at a bi-invariant metric. We prove rigidity
theorems for paths which remain nonnegatively curved, and we make progress
towards a classification of the left-invariant metrics with nonnegative
curvature on SO(4).
