We have obtained the metric operator $\Theta=\exp T$ for the non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian model $H=\omega(a^{\dag}a+1/2)+\alpha(a^{2}-a^{\dag^{2}})$. We have
also found the intertwining operator which connects the Hamiltonian to the
adjoint of its pseudo-supersymmetric partner Hamiltonian for the model of
hyperbolic Rosen-Morse II potential.
