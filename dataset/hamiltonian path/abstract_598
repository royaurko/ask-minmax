Using the E-algebraic systems, various graded irreducible representations of
a Leavitt path algebra L of a graph E over a field K are constructed. The
concept of a Laurent vertex is introduced and it is shown that the minimal
graded left ideals of L are generated by Laurent vertices and/or line points
leading to a detailed description of the graded socle of L. Following this, a
complete characterization is obtained of the Leavitt path algebras over which
every graded irreducible representation is finitely presented. A useful result
is that the irreducible representation V_[p] induced by infinite path
tail-equivalent to an infinite path p is graded if and only if p is an
irrational infinite path. We also show that every one-sided ideal of L is
graded if and only if the graph E contains no cycles. Supplementing a theorem
of one of the co-contributors that every Leavitt path algebra is graded von Neumann
regular, we describe the graded self-injective Leavitt path algebras. These
turn out to be direct sums of matrix rings of arbitrary size over K and
k[x,x^-1].
