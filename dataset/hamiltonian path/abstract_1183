We prove a general theorem about the self-adjointness and domain of
Pauli-Fierz type Hamiltonians. Our proof is based on commutator arguments which
allow us to treat fields with non-commuting components. As a corollary it
follows that the domain of the Hamiltonian of non-relativistic QED with Coulomb
interactions is independent of the coupling constant.
