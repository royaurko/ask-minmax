Euclidean quantum-gravity path-integrals are investigated within Regge
calculus by computer simulations. The domain of integration is restricted by
introducing a lower limit for the fatness of each simplex. We use the standard
hypercubic triangulation of the 4-torus and irregularly triangulated lattices
obtained by inserting a small number of vertices using barycentric subdivision.
For limited fatness we find an entropy dominated phase with small negative
curvature both for the regular and the irregular triangulation.
