In two previous papers, we constructed two modified Hamiltonian formalisms to
make maps among manifolds explicit. In this paper, the two modified formalisms
were adapted to manifolds with local coordinates given by scalar fields, as in
a classical nonlinear sigma-model. The scalar field coordinates could be built
from vectors, tensors, spinors, Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, group parameters,
etc.
