Edge-magic total labeling was introduced by \cite{GS}. The number of
edge-magic solutions for cycles have been explored in \cite{BS}. This sequence
is mentioned in On Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) \cite{oeis}.
In this short note, we enumerate the number of unique edge-magic total
labelings on Path $P_n$
