We derive new finitized fermionic characters for the superconformal unitary
minimal models by interpreting the RSOS configuration sums as fermi-gas
partition functions. This extends to the supersymmetric case the method
introduced by Warnaar for the Virasoro unitary mimimal models. The key point in
this construction is the proper identification of fermi-type charged particles
in terms of the path's peaks. For this, an instrumental preliminary step is the
adaptation to the superconformal case of the operator description of the usual
RSOS paths introduced recently.
