Semiclassical expansions for traces involving Greens functions have two
contributions, one from the periodic or recurrent orbits of the classical
system and one from the phase space volume, i.e. the paths of infinitesimal
length. Quantitative calculations require the control of both terms. Here, we
discuss the contribution from paths of zero length with an emphasis on the
application to Franck-Condon transitions. The expansion in the energy
representation is asymptotic and a critical parameter is identified. In the
time domain, a series expansion of the logarithm of the propagator gives very
good results. The expansions are illustrated for transitions onto a linear
potential and onto a harmonic oscillator.
