We study the dynamical behaviour of Hamiltonian flows defined on
4-dimensional compact symplectic manifolds. We find the existence of a
C2-residual set of Hamiltonians for which every regular energy surface is
either Anosov or it is in the closure of energy surfaces with zero Lyapunov
exponents a.e. This is in the spirit of the Bochi-Mane dichotomy for
area-preserving diffeomorphisms on compact surfaces and its continuous-time
version for 3-dimensional volume-preserving flows.
