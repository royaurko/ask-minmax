Free quantal motion on group manifolds is considered. The Hamiltonian is
given by the Laplace -- Beltrami operator on the group manifold, and the
purpose is to get the (Feynman's) evolution kernel. The spectral expansion,
which produced a series of the representation characters for the evolution
kernel in the compact case, does not exist for non-compact group, where the
spectrum is not bounded. In this work real analytical groups are investigated,
some of which are of interest for physics. An integral representation for the
evolution operator is obtained in terms of the Green function, i.e. the
solution to the Helmholz equation on the group manifold. The alternative series
expressions for the evolution operator are reconstructed from the same integral
representation, the spectral expansion (when exists) and the sum over classical
paths. For non-compact groups, the latter can be interpreted as the (exact)
semi-classical approximation, like in the compact case. The explicit form of
the evolution operator is obtained for a number of non-compact groups.
