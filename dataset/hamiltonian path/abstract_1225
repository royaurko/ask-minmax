We have studied a three-level {\Lambda}-type atomic system with all the
energy levels exhibiting decay. The system is described by a pseudo-Hermitian
Hamiltonian and subject to certain conditions, the Hamiltonian shows
parity-time (PT) symmetry. The probability amplitudes of various atomic levels
both below and above the PT-theshold is worked out.
