Solutions to the BBGKY hierarchy of equations for molecular Brownian particle
in ideal gas are considered, and exact relations are derived between
probability distribution of path of the particle, its derivatives in respect to
gas density and irreducible many-particle correlations of gas atoms with the
path. It is shown that all the correlations always give equally important
contributions to evolution of the path distribution, and therefore the exact
statistical mechanics theory does not reduce to classical kinetics even in the
low-density limit.
