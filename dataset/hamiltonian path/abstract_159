In 1992, Manoussakis conjectured that a strongly 2-connected digraph $D$ on
$n$ vertices is hamiltonian if for every two distinct pairs of independent
vertices $x,y$ and $w,z$ we have $d(x)+d(y)+d(w)+d(z)\geq 4n-3$. In this note
we show that $D$ has a Hamilton path, which gives an affirmative evidence
supporting this conjecture.
