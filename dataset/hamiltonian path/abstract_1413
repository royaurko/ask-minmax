A simple Hamiltonian manifold is a closed connected symplectic manifold
equipped with a Hamiltonian action of a torus T with moment map Phi: M-->t^*,
such that the fixed set M^T has exactly two connected components, denoted M_0
and M_1. We study the differential and symplectic geometry of simple
Hamiltonian manifolds, including a large number of examples.
