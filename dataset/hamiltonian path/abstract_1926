The path-integral of the fermionic oscillator with a time-dependent frequency
is analyzed. We give the exact relation between the boundary condition to
define the domain in which the path-integral is performed and the transition
amplitude that the path-integral calculates. According to this relation, the
amplitude suppressed by a zero mode does not indicate any special dynamics,
unlike the analogous situation in field theories. It simply says the
path-integral picks up a combination of the amplitudes that vanishes. The zero
mode that is often neglected in the reason of not being normalizable is
necessary to obtain the correct answer for the propagator and to avoid an
anomaly on the fermion number. We give a method to obtain the fermionic
determinant by the determinant of a simple (2\times 2) matrix, which enables us
to calculate it for a variety of boundary conditions.
