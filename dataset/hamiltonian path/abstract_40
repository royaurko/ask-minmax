In this paper we use a path-integral approach to represent the Lyapunov
exponents of both deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems. In both cases
the relevant correlation functions are obtained from a (one-dimensional)
supersymmetric field theory whose Hamiltonian, in the deterministic case,
coincides with the Lie-derivative of the associated Hamiltonian flow. The
generalized Lyapunov exponents turn out to be related to the partition
functions of the respective super-Hamiltonian restricted to the spaces of fixed
form-degree.
