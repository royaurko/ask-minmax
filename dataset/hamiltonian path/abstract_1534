The generalized Swanson Hamiltonian $H_{GS} = w (\tilde{a}\tilde{a}^\dag+
1/2) + \alpha \tilde{a}^2 + \beta \tilde{a}^{\dag^2}$ with $\tilde{a} =
A(x)d/dx + B(x)$, can be transformed into an equivalent Hermitian Hamiltonian
with the help of a similarity transformation. It is shown that the equivalent
Hermitian Hamiltonian can be further transformed into the harmonic oscillator
Hamiltonian so long as $[\tilde{a},\tilde{a}^\dag]=$ constant. However, the
main objective of this paper is to show that though the commutator of
$\tilde{a}$ and $\tilde{a}^\dag$ is constant, the generalized Swanson
Hamiltonian is not necessarily isospectral to the harmonic oscillator. Reason
for this anomaly is discussed in the frame work of position dependent mass
models by choosing $A(x)$ as the inverse square root of the mass function.
