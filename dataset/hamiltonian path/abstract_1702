This paper deals with a new middle path approach developed for reducing
alignment calculations in BLAST algorithm. This is a new step which is
introduced in BLAST algorithm in between the ungapped and gapped alignments.
This step of middle path approach between the ungapped and gapped alignments
reduces the number of sequences going for gapped alignment. This results in the
improvement in speed for alignment up to 30 percent.
