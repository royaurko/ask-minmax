In the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm, Hamiltonian
symmetries play an important role. Using symmetries, the matrix representation
of the Hamiltonian can be blocked. Diagonalizing each matrix block is more
efficient than diagonalizing the original matrix. This paper explains how the
the DMRG++ code has been extended to handle the non-local SU(2) symmetry in a
model independent way. Improvements in CPU times compared to runs with only
local symmetries are discussed for the one-orbital Hubbard model, and for a
two-orbital Hubbard model for iron-based superconductors. The computational
bottleneck of the algorithm and the use of shared memory parallelization are
also addressed.
