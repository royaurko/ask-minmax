The Robotic Remote Laboratory controls the Robot labs via the Internet and
applies the Robot experiment in easy and advanced way. If we want to enhance
the RRL system, we must study requirements of the Robot experiment in a deeply
way. One of key requirements of the Robot experiment is the Control algorithm
that includes all important activities to affect the Robot; one of them relates
the path or obstacle. Our goal is to produce a new design of the RRL includes a
new treatment to the Control algorithm depends on isolation one of the Control
algorithm's activities that relates the paths in a separated algorithm, i.e.,
design the (Path planning algorithm) is independent of the original Control
algorithm. This aim can be achieved by depending on the light to produce the
Light obstacle. To apply the Light obstacle, we need to hardware (Light control
server and Light arms) and soft ware (path planning algorithm).The NXT 2.0
Robot will sense the Light obstacle depending on the Light sensor of it. The
new design has two servers, one for the path (Light control server) and other
for the other activities of the Control algorithm (Robot control server).The
website of the new design includes three main parts (Lab Reservation, Open Lab,
Download Simulation).We proposed a set of scenarios for organizing the
reservation of the Remote Lab. Additionally, we developed an appropriate
software to simulate the Robot and to practice it before usage the Remote lab.
