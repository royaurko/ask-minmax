In terms of the matrix valued Berry gauge field strength for the Weyl
Hamiltonian in any even spacetime dimensions a symplectic form whose elements
are matrices in spin indices is introduced. Definition of the volume form is
modified appropriately. A simple method of finding the path integral measure
and the chiral current in the presence of external electromagnetic fields is
presented. It is shown that within this new approach the chiral magnetic effect
as well as the chiral anomaly in even d+1 dimensions are accomplished
straightforwardly.
