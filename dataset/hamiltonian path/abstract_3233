An upper bound on degrees of elements of a minimal generating system for
invariants of quivers of dimension (2,...,2) is established over a field of
arbitrary characteristic and its precision is estimated. The proof is based on
the reduction to the problem of description of maximal paths satisfying certain
condition.
