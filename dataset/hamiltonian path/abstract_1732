With every path on a projective line minus zero, one and infinity there is
associated a measure. We are studying a sum of two such measures associated to
paths from the tangential point at zero to roots of one. We show that the
obtained measure can be defined very elementary. Integrating agaist this
measure we get p-adic Hurwitz zeta functions constructed previously by
Shiratani.
