We perform path integral for a quark (antiquark) in the presence of an
arbitrary space-dependent static color potential A^a_0(x)(=-\int dx E^a(x))
with arbitrary color index a=1,2,...8 in SU(3) and obtain an exact
non-perturbative expression for the generating functional. We show that such a
path integration is possible even if one can not solve the Dirac equation in
the presence of arbitrary space-dependent potential. It may be possible to
further explore this path integral technique to study non-perturbative bound
state formation.
