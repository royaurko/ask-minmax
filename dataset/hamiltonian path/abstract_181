The glueball spectrum within the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge
theory (without fermions) is calculated for the gauge group SU(2) and for two
spatial dimensions.
  The Hilbert space of gauge-invariant functions of the gauge field is
generated by its parallel-transporters on closed paths along the links of the
spatial lattice. The coupled cluster method is used to determine the spectrum
of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian in a truncated basis. The quality of the
description is studied by computing results from various truncations, lattice
regularisations and with an improved Hamiltonian.
  We find consistency for the mass ratio predictions within a scaling region
where we obtain good agreement with standard lattice Monte Carlo results.
