Several years ago, we proposed a modification of the Standard Model, in which
the Higgs sector was stabilized by the addition of higher derivative operators,
similar to Lee-Wick Electrodynamics. We studied this theory extensively, both
using continuum Hamiltonian and path integral methods. We also reported
detailed lattice studies of the higher derivative Higgs sector. In view of some
recent revived interest in our original idea, we are providing here our
extensive notes from the time period on this topic. The key results were
already published in our papers at that time. The many additional details that
we make available here were previously available only in Chuan Liu's UCSD Ph.D.
thesis (1994). Very recently, our idea has been revived by other groups. In
view of the renewed interest, and to perhaps correct some misconceptions in the
literature, we are here making our original extensive notes available to the
wider community.
