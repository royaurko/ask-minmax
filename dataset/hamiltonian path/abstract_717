It has recently been observed that the normalization of a one-dimensional
out-of-equilibrium model, the Asymmetric Exclusion Process (ASEP) with random
sequential dynamics, is exactly equivalent to the partition function of a
two-dimensional lattice path model of one-transit walks, or equivalently Dyck
paths. This explains the applicability of the Lee-Yang theory of partition
function zeros to the ASEP normalization.
  In this paper we consider the exact solution of the parallel-update ASEP, a
special case of the Nagel-Schreckenberg model for traffic flow, in which the
ASEP phase transitions can be intepreted as jamming transitions, and find that
Lee-Yang theory still applies. We show that the parallel-update ASEP
normalization can be expressed as one of several equivalent two-dimensional
lattice path problems involving weighted Dyck or Motzkin paths. We introduce
the notion of thermodynamic equivalence for such paths and show that the
robustness of the general form of the ASEP phase diagram under various update
dynamics is a consequence of this thermodynamic equivalence.
