In this paper we provide a criterion for the quasi-autonomous Hamiltonian
path (``Hofer's geodesic'') on arbitrary closed symplectic manifolds
$(M,\omega)$ to be length minimizing in its homotopy class in terms of the
spectral invariants $\rho(G;1)$ that the contributor has recently constructed
(math.SG/0206092). As an application, we prove that any autonomous Hamiltonian
path on arbitrary closed symplectic manifolds is length minimizing in {\it its
homotopy class} with fixed ends, when it has no contractible periodic orbits
{\it of period one}, has a maximum and a minimum point which are generically
under-twisted and all of its critical points are nondegenerate in the Floer
theoretic sense. This is a sequel to the papers math.SG/0104243 and
math.SG/0206092.
