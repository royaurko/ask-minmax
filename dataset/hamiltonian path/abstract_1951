In J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 28, 4305 (1995), K. L. Sebastian gave a path
integral computation of the propagator of subdiffusive fractional Brownian
motion (fBm), i.e. fBm with a Hurst or self-similarity exponent $H\in(0,1/2)$.
The extension of Sebastian's calculation to superdiffusion, $H\in(1/2,1]$,
becomes however quite involved due to the appearance of additional boundary
conditions on fractional derivatives of the path. In this paper, we address the
construction of the path integral representation in a different fashion, which
allows to treat both subdiffusion and superdiffusion on an equal footing. The
derivation of the propagator of fBm for general Hurst exponent is then
performed in a neat and unified way.
