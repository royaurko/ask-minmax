Path and path deviation equations for charged, spinning and spinning charged
objects in different versions of Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory using a modified
Bazanski Lagrangian have been derived. The significance of motion in five
dimensions, especially for a charged spinning object, has been examined. We
have also extended the modified Bazanski approach to derive the path and path
deviation equations of a test particle in a version of non-symmetric KK theory.
