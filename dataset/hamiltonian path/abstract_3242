Numerical simulations of assemblies of grains under cyclic loading exhibit
``granular ratcheting'': a small net deformation occurs with each cycle,
leading to a linear accumulation of deformation with cycle number. We show that
this is due to a curious property of the most frequently used models of the
particle-particle interaction: namely, that the potential energy stored in
contacts is path-dependent. There exist closed paths that change the stored
energy, even if the particles remain in contact and do not slide. An
alternative method for calculating the tangential force removes granular
ratcheting.
