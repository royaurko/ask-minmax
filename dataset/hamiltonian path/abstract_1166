Geometric separability theory of Gel'fand-Zakharevich bi-Hamiltonian systems
on Riemannian manifolds is reviewed and developed. Particular attention is paid
to the separability of systems generated by the so-called special conformal
Killing tensors, i.e. Benenti systems. Then, infinitely many new classes of
separable systems are constructed by appropriate deformations of Benenti class
systems. All such systems can be lifted to the Gel'fand-Zakharevich
bi-Hamiltonian form.
