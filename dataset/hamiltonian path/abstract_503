In a spacetime with no global timelike Killing vector, we do not have a
natural choice for the vacuum state of matter fields, leading to an ambiguity
in defining the Feynman propagators. In this paper, taking the vacuum state to
be the instantaneous ground state of the Hamiltonian at each moment, we develop
a method for calculating wave functions associated with the vacuum and the
corresponding in-in and in-out propagators. We apply this method to free scalar
field theory in de Sitter space and obtain de Sitter invariant propagators in
various coordinate patches. We show that the in-out propagator in the Poincare
patch has a finite massless limit in a de Sitter invariant form. We argue and
numerically check that our in-out propagators agree with those obtained by a
path integral with the standard i\epsilon prescription, and identify the
condition on a foliation of spacetime under which such coincidence can happen
for the foliation. We also show that the in-out propagators satisfy Polyakov's
composition law. Several applications of our framework are also discussed.
