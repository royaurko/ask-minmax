A bi-Hamiltonian hierarchy of quaternion soliton equations is derived from
geometric non-stretching flows of curves in the quaternionic projective space
$HP^n$. The derivation adapts the method and results in recent work by one of
us on the Hamiltonian structure of non-stretching curve flows in Riemannian
symmetric spaces $M=G/H$ by viewing $HP^n \simeq {\rm U}(n+1,H)/{\rm U}(1,H)
\times {\rm U}(n,H)\simeq {\rm Sp}(n+1)/{\rm Sp}(1)\times {\rm Sp}(n)$ as a
symmetric space in terms of compact real symplectic groups and quaternion
unitary groups. As main results, scalar-vector (multi-component) versions of
the sine-Gordon (SG) equation and the modified Korteveg-de Vries (mKdV)
equation are obtained along with their bi-Hamiltonian integrability structure
consisting of a shared hierarchy of quaternionic symmetries and conservation
laws generated by a hereditary recursion operator. The corresponding geometric
curve flows in $HP^n$ are shown to be described by a non-stretching wave map
and a mKdV analog of a non-stretching Schrodinger map.
