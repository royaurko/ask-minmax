We construct infinitely many connected, circulant digraphs of outdegree three
that have no hamiltonian circuit. All of our examples have an even number of
vertices, and our examples are of two types: either every vertex in the digraph
is adjacent to two diametrically opposite vertices, or every vertex is adjacent
to the vertex diametrically opposite to itself.
