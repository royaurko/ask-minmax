Stochastic effects may cause fade-out of an infectious disease in a
population immediately after an epidemic outbreak. We develop WKB theory to
determine the most probable path of the system toward epidemic fade-out and to
evaluate the fade-out probability. The most probable path is an instanton-like
orbit in the phase space of the underlying Hamiltonian flow.
