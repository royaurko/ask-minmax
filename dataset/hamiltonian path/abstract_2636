We show that the KdV6 equation recently studied in [1,2] is equivalent to the
Rosochatius deformation of KdV equation with self-consistent sources
(RD-KdVESCS) recently presented in [9]. The $t$-type bi-Hamiltonian formalism
of KdV6 equation (RD-KdVESCS) is constructed by taking $x$ as evolution
parameter. Some new solutions of KdV6 equation, such as soliton, positon and
negaton solution, are presented.
