For ordinary hermitian Hamiltonians, the states show the Kramers degeneracy
when the system has a half-odd-integer spin and the time reversal operator
obeys \Theta^2=-1, but no such a degeneracy exists when \Theta^2=+1. Here we
point out that for non-hermitian systems, there exists a degeneracy similar to
Kramers even when \Theta^2=+1. It is found that the new degeneracy follows from
the mathematical structure of split-quaternion, instead of quaternion from
which the Kramers degeneracy follows in the usual hermitian cases. Furthermore,
we also show that particle/hole symmetry gives rise to a pair of states with
opposite energies on the basis of the split quaternion in a class of
non-hermitian Hamiltonians. As concrete examples, we examine in detail NxN
Hamiltonians with N=2 and 4 which are non-hermitian generalizations of spin 1/2
Hamiltonian and quadrupole Hamiltonian of spin 3/2, respectively.
