It is well known that the Poisson Lie algebra is isomorphic to the
Hamiltonian Lie algebra. We show that the Poisson Lie algebra can be embedded
properly in the special type Lie algebra. We also generalize the Hamiltonian
Lie algebra using exponential functions, and we show that these Lie algebras
are simple.
