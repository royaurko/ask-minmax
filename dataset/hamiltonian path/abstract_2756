A mapping technique is used to derive in the context of constituent quark
models effective Hamiltonians that involve explicit hadron degrees of freedom.
The technique is based on the ideas of mapping between physical and ideal Fock
spaces and shares similarities with the quasiparticle method of Weinberg.
Starting with the Fock-space representation of single-hadron states, a change
of representation is implemented by a unitary transformation such that
composites are redescribed by elementary Bose and Fermi field operators in an
extended Fock space. When the unitary transformation is applied to the
microscopic quark Hamiltonian, effective, hermitian Hamiltonians with a clear
physical interpretation are obtained. Applications and comparisons with other
composite-particle formalisms of the recent literature are made using the
nonrelativistic quark model.
