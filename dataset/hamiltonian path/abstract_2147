Topological properties of a certain class of spinless three-band Hamiltonians
are shown to be summed up by the Skyrmion number in momentum space, analogous
to the case of two-band Hamiltonian. Topological tight-binding Hamiltonian on a
Kagome lattice is analyzed with this view. When such a Hamiltonian is "folded",
the two bands with opposite Chern numbers merge into a degenerate band
exhibiting non-Abelian gauge connection. Conserved pseudo-spin current operator
can be constructed in this case and used to compute the pseudo-spin Hall
conductance. Our model Hamiltonians belong to the symmetry class D and AI
according to the ten-fold classification scheme.
