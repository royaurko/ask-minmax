Kinetics of metastable systems modeled by Hamiltonians containing nonlocal
and nonconservative terms is reproduced by the Fokker-Planck and imaginary time
Schrodinger equation scheme with subsequent symplectic integration. Example
solutions for ergodicity breaking in ferroelectrics reassure the H-theorem of
global stability [M. Shiino, Phys. Rev. A, Vol 36, pp. 2393-2411 (1987)] and
reproduce spatially extended polarization response in time-dependent external
fields.
