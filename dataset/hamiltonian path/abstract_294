There are several approaches to study occurrences of consecutive patterns in
permutations such as the inclusion-exclusion method, the tree representations
of permutations, the spectral approach and others. We propose yet another
approach to study occurrences of consecutive patterns in permutations. The
approach is based on considering the graph of patterns overlaps, which is a
certain subgraph of the de Bruijn graph.
  While applying our approach, the notion of a uniquely $k$-determined
permutation appears. We give two criteria for a permutation to be uniquely
$k$-determined: one in terms of the distance between two consecutive elements
in a permutation, and the other one in terms of directed hamiltonian paths in
the certain graphs called path-schemes. Moreover, we describe a finite set of
prohibitions that gives the set of uniquely $k$-determined permutations. Those
prohibitions make applying the transfer matrix method possible for determining
the number of uniquely $k$-determined permutations.
