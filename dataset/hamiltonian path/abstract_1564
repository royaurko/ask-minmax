We introduce an operator description for a stochastic sandpile model with a
conserved particle density, and develop a path-integral representation for its
evolution. The resulting (exact) expression for the effective action highlights
certain interesting features of the model, for example, that it is nominally
massless, and that the dynamics is via cooperative diffusion. Using the
path-integral formalism, we construct a diagrammatic perturbation theory,
yielding a series expansion for the activity density in powers of the time.
