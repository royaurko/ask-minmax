Under a certain condition, we find the explicit formulas for the trace
functions of certain intertwining operators among gl(n)-modules, introduced by
Etingof in connection with the solutions of the Calogero-Sutherland model. If
n=2, the master function of the trace function is exactly the classical Gauss
hypergeometric function. When n>2, the master functions of the trace functions
are a new family of multiple hypergeometric functions, whose differential
property and integral representation are dominated certain polynomials of
integral paths connecting pairs of positive integers. Moreover, we define and
explicitly find similar trace functions for sp(2n), which give rise to
solutions of the Olshanesky-Perelomov model of type C. The master functions of
the trace functions for sp(2n) are similar new multiple path hypergeometric
functions. Analogous multiple path hypergeometric functions for orthogonal Lie
algebras are defined and studied.
