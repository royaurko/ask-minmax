Hamiltonian mixed systems with unbounded phase space are typically
characterized by two asymptotic algebraic laws: decay of recurrence time
statistics ($\gamma$) and superdiffusion ($\beta$). We conjecture the universal
exponents $\gamma=\beta=3/2$ for trapping of trajectories to regular islands
based on our analytical results for a wide class of area-preserving maps. For
Hamiltonian mixed systems with bounded phase space the interval
$3/2\leq\gamma_{b}\leq3$ was obtained, given that trapping takes place. A
number of simulations and experiments by other contributors give additional support
to our claims.
