We review, restate, and prove a result due to Kaushal and Korsch [Phys. Lett.
A 276, 47 (2000)] on the complete integrability of two-dimensional Hamiltonian
systems whose Hamiltonian satisfies a set of four linear second order partial
differential equations. In particular, we show that a two-dimensional
Hamiltonian system is completely integrable, if the Hamiltonian has the form
$H=T+V$ where $V$ and $T$ are respectively harmonic functions of the
generalized coordinates and the associated momenta.
