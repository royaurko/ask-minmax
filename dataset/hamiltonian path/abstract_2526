An new superconducting hamiltonian is introduced for which the exact ground
state is the Anderson resonating valence bond. It differs from the t-J and
hubbard hamiltonians in possessing a powerful attractive force. Its
superconducting state is characterized by a full and intact d-wave tunneling
gap, quasiparticle photoemission intensities that are strongly suppressed, a
suppressed superfluid density, and an incipient Mott-Hubbard gap.
