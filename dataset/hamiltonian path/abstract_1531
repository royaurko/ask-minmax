Based on preliminary analysis of the Hamiltonian formulation of the first
order Einstein-Cartan action (arXiv:0902.0856 [gr-qc] and arXiv:0907.1553
[gr-qc]) we derive the Darboux coordinates, which are a unique and uniform
change of variables preserving equivalence with the original action in all
spacetime dimensions higher than two. Considerable simplification of the
Hamiltonian formulation using the Darboux coordinates, compared with direct
analysis, is explicitly demonstrated. Even an incomplete Hamiltonian analysis
in combination with known symmetries of the Einstein-Cartan action and the
equivalence of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations allows us to
unambiguously conclude that the \textit{unique} \textit{gauge} invariances
generated by the first class constraints of the Einstein-Cartan action and the
corresponding Hamiltonian are \textit{translation and rotation in the tangent
space}. Diffeomorphism invariance, though a manifest invariance of the action,
is not generated by the first class constraints of the theory.
