The exact nondipole minimal-coupling Hamiltonian for an atom interacting with
an explicitly time- and space-dependent laser field is transformed into the
rest frame of a classical free electron in the laser field, i.e., into the
Kramers-Henneberger frame. The new form of the Hamiltonian is used to study
nondipole effects in the high-intensity, high-frequency regime. Fully three
dimensional nondipole {\it ab initio} wavepacket calculations show that the
ionization probability may decrease for increasing field strength. We identify
a unique signature for the onset of this dynamical stabilization effect in the
photoelectron spectrum.
