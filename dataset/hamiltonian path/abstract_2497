We prove a reduction theorem for the tangent bundle of a Poisson manifold
$(M, \pi)$ endowed with a pre-Hamiltonian action of a Poisson Lie group $(G,
\pi_G)$. In the special case of a Hamiltonian action of a Lie group, we are
able to compare our reduction to the classical Marsden-Ratiu reduction of $M$.
If the manifold $M$ is symplectic and simply connected, the reduced tangent
bundle is integrable and its integral symplectic groupoid is the
Marsden-Weinstein reduction of the pair groupoid $M \times \bar{M}$.
