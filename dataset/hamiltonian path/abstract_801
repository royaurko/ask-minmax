We extend the notion of unicorn paths between two arcs introduced by Hensel,
Przytycki and Webb to the case where we replace one arc with a geodesic
asymptotic to a lamination. Using these paths, we give new proofs of the
results of Klarreich and Schleimer identifying the Gromov boundaries of the
curve graph and the arc graph, respectively, as spaces of laminations.
