We define coherent states for SU(3) using six bosonic creation and
annihilation operators. These coherent states are explicitly characterized by
six complex numbers with constraints. For the completely symmetric
representations (n,0) and (0,m), only three of the bosonic operators are
required. For mixed representations (n,m), all six operators are required. The
coherent states provide a resolution of identity, satisfy the continuity
property, and possess a variety of group theoretic properties. We introduce an
explicit parameterization of the group SU(3) and the corresponding integration
measure. Finally, we discuss the path integral formalism for a problem in which
the Hamiltonian is a function of SU(3) operators at each site.
