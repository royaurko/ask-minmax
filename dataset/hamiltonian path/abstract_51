Path integral methods are used to derive a general expression for the entropy
of a black hole in a diffeomorphism invariant theory. The result, which depends
on the variational derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the Riemann
tensor, agrees with the result obtained from Noether charge methods by Iyer and
Wald. The method used here is based on the direct expression of the density of
states as a path integral (the microcanonical functional integral). The
analysis makes crucial use of the Hamiltonian form of the action. An algorithm
for placing the action of a diffeomorphism invariant theory in Hamiltonian form
is presented. Other path integral approaches to the derivation of black hole
entropy include the Hilbert action surface term method and the conical deficit
angle method. The relationships between these path integral methods are
presented.
