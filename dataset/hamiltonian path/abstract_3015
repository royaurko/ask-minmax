We derive an exact solution for the total kinetic energy of noninteracting
spinless electrons at half-filling in two-dimensional bipartite lattices. We
employ a conceptually novel approach that maps this problem exactly into a
Feynman-Vdovichenko lattice walker. The problem is then reduced to the analytic
study of the sum of magnetic phase factors on closed paths. We compare our
results with the ones obtained through numerical calculations.
