We construct complete sets of invariant quantities that are integrals of
motion for two Hamiltonian systems obtained through a reduction procedure, thus
proving that these systems are maximally superintegrable. We also discuss the
reduction method used in this article and its possible generalization to other
maximally superintegrable systems.
