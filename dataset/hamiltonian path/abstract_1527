The static, i.e., linear momentum independent, part of the next-to-leading
order (NLO) gravitational spin(1)-spin(1) interaction Hamiltonian within the
post-Newtonian (PN) approximation is calculated from a 3-dim. covariant ansatz
for the Hamilton constraint. All coefficients in this ansatz can be uniquely
fixed for black holes. The resulting Hamiltonian fits into the canonical
formalism of Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner (ADM) and is given in their
transverse-traceless (ADMTT) gauge. This completes the recent result for the
momentum dependent part of the NLO spin(1)-spin(1) ADM Hamiltonian for binary
black holes (BBH). Thus, all PN NLO effects up to quadratic order in spin for
BBH are now given in Hamiltonian form in the ADMTT gauge. The equations of
motion resulting from this Hamiltonian are an important step toward more
accurate calculations of templates for gravitational waves.
