We study massive 1/2-spin particles in various external backgrounds keeping
in mind applications to neutrino physics. We are mainly interested in massive
Majorana (Weyl) fields. However, massive neutral Dirac particles are also
considered. We formulate classical Lagrangian theory of the massive Weyl field
in terms of Grassmann-odd two-component spinors. Then we construct the
Hamiltonian formulation of such a theory, which turns out to be a theory with
second-class constraints. Using this formulation we canonically quantize the
massive free Weyl field. We derive propagators of the Weyl field and relate
them to the propagator of a massive Dirac particle. We also study the massive
Weyl particles propagating in the background mater. We find the path integral
representation for the propagator of such a field, as well as the corresponding
pseudoclassical particle action. The massless limit of the Weyl field
interacting with the matter is considered and compared with results of other
works. Finally, the path integral representation for the propagator of the
neutral massive Dirac particle with an anomalous magnetic moment moving in the
background matter and external electromagnetic field, as well as the
corresponding pseudoclassical particle action are constructed.
