We present a derivation of the propagator for a particle in the presence of
the step and delta function potentials. These propagators are known, but we
present a direct path integral derivation, based on the path decomposition
expansion and the Brownian motion definition of the path integral. The
derivation exploits properties of the Catalan numbers, which enumerate certain
classes of lattice paths.
