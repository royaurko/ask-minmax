In the framework of path integral the evolution operator kernel for the
Merton-Garman Hamiltonian is constructed. Based on this kernel option formula
is obtained, which generalizes the well-known Black-Scholes result. Possible
approximation numerical schemes for path integral calculations are proposed.
