We consider the problem of reconstructing vehicle trajectories from sparse
sequences of GPS points, for which the sampling interval is between 10 seconds
and 2 minutes. We introduce a new class of algorithms, called altogether path
inference filter (PIF), that maps GPS data in real time, for a variety of
trade-offs and scenarios, and with a high throughput. Numerous prior approaches
in map-matching can be shown to be special cases of the path inference filter
presented in this article. We present an efficient procedure for automatically
training the filter on new data, with or without ground truth observations. The
framework is evaluated on a large San Francisco taxi dataset and is shown to
improve upon the current state of the art. This filter also provides insights
about driving patterns of drivers. The path inference filter has been deployed
at an industrial scale inside the Mobile Millennium traffic information system,
and is used to map fleets of data in San Francisco, Sacramento, Stockholm and
Porto.
