We consider the classical one-dimensional random walk of a particle on the
right-half real line. We assume that the particle is initially at position x=k,
k > 0, and moves to the right with probability p or to the left with
probability 1-p. We consider that the particle is absorbed at the origin
without fixing the number of steps needed to get there. We calculate the
probability P(x=k) that the particles end up at the origin, given that it
starts at x=k, by means of a geometric representation of this random walk in
terms of paths on a two-dimensional lattice.
