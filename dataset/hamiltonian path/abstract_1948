Optimal sample path properties of stochastic processes often involve
generalized H\"{o}lder- or variation norms. Following a classical result of
Taylor, the exact variation of Brownian motion is measured in terms of $\psi
(x) \equiv $ $x^{2}/\log \log (1/x) $ near $0+$. Such $\psi $-variation results
extend to classes of processes with values in abstract metric spaces. (No
Gaussian or Markovian properties are assumed.) To establish integrability
properties of the $\psi $-variation we turn to a large class of Gaussian rough
paths (e.g. Brownian motion and L\'{e}vy's area viewed as a process in a Lie
group) and prove Gaussian integrability properties using Borell's inequality on
abstract Wiener spaces. The interest in such results is that they are
compatible with rough path theory and yield certain sharp regularity and
integrability properties (for iterated Stratonovich integrals, for example)
which would be difficult to obtain otherwise. At last, $\psi $-variation is
identified as robust regularity property of solutions to (random) rough
differential equations beyond semimartingales.
