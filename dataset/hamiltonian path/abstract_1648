Let D be a Dyck path chosen uniformly from the set of Dyck paths with 2n
steps. We prove that the sequence of the exponential moments of the maximum of
D normalized by the square root of n converges in the limit of infinite n, and
therefore is bounded uniformly in n. This result justifies corresponding
assumption used to prove certain estimates of high moments of large random
matrices.
