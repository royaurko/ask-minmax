We give the correct prescriptions for the terms involving the inverse of the
derivative of the delta function, in the Hamiltonian structures of the AKNS and
DNLS systems, in order for the Jacobi identities to hold. We also establish
that the sl(2) AKNS and DNLS systems are tri-Hamiltonians and construct two
compatible Hamiltonian structures for the sl(3) AKNS system. We also give a
derivation of the recursion operator for the sl(n+1) DNLS system.
