We investigate certain measures induced by families of non-intersecting paths
in domino tilings of the Aztec diamond, rhombus tilings of an abc-hexagon, a
dimer model on a cylindrical brick lattice and a growth model. The measures
obtained, e.g. the Krawtchouk and Hahn ensembles, have the same structure as
the eigenvalue measures in random matrix theory like GUE, which can in fact be
obtained from non-intersecting Brownian motions. The derivations of the
measures are based on the Karlin-McGregor or Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot method.
We use the measure to show some asymptotic results for the models.
