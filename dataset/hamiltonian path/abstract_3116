We derive a worldline path integral representation for the effective action
of a multiplet of Dirac fermions coupled to the most general set of
matrix-valued scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial vector and antisymmetric
tensor background fields. By representing internal degrees of freedom in terms
of worldline fermions as well, we obtain a formulation which manifestly
exhibits chiral gauge invariance.
