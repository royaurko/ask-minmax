We give a status report of our work on light cone Hamiltonian lattice QCD. We
have derived an effective Hamiltonian $H_{eff}$ which is only quadratic in the
momenta and therefore can be simulated by standard methods. For this
Hamiltonian we determine variationally an approximate ground state wave
functional in the light cone limit.
