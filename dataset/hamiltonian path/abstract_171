We consider a two-parameter non hermitean quantum-mechanical hamiltonian that
is invariant under the combined effects of parity and time reversal
transformation. Numerical investigation shows that for some values of the
potential parameters the hamiltonian operator supports real eigenvalues and
localized eigenfunctions. In contrast with other PT symmetric models, which
require special integration paths in the complex plane, our model is integrable
along a line parallel to the real axis.
