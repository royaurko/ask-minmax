The problem of proper symmetry definition for constraint dynamical systems
with Hamiltonians is considered. Finally, we choose a definition of symmetry
which agrees with the analogous definition used for the non-constraint
dynamical systems with Hamiltonians. Our symmetry definition allows one to
consider the whole spectrum of the Hamiltonian without splitting it into a few
different parts.
