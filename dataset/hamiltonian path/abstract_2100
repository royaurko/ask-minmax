We describe the structure of the Lie groups endowed with a left-invariant
symplectic form, called symplectic Lie groups, in terms of semi-direct products
of Lie groups, symplectic reduction and principal bundles with affine fiber.
This description is particularly nice if the group is Hamiltonian, that is, if
the left canonical action of the group on itself is Hamiltonian. The principal
tool used for our description is a canonical affine structure associated with
the symplectic form. We also characterize the Hamiltonian symplectic Lie groups
among the connected symplectic Lie groups. We specialize our principal results
to the cases of simply connected Hamiltonian symplectic nilpotent Lie groups or
Frobenius symplectic Lie groups. Finally we pursue the study of the classical
affine Lie group as a symplectic Lie group.
