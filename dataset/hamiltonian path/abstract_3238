We study a random growth model on $\R^d$ introduced by Deijfen. This is a
continuous first-passage percolation model. The growth occurs by means of
spherical outbursts with random radii in the infected region. We aim at finding
conditions on the distribution of the random radii to determine whether the
growth of the process is linear or not. To do so, we compare this model with a
continuous analogue of the greedy lattice paths model and transpose results in
the lattice setting to the continuous setting.
