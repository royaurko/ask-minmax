We show that parity is conserved in vector-like supersymmetric theories, such
as supersymmetric QCD with massive quarks with no cubic couplings among chiral
multiplets, based on fermionic path-integrals, originally developed by Vafa and
Witten. We also look into the effect of supersymmetric breaking through gluino
masses, and see that the parity-conservation is intact also in this case. Our
conclusion is valid, when only bosonic parity-breaking observable terms are
considered in path-integrals like the original Vafa-Witten formulation.
