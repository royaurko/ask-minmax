As observed by Rautenbach and Sereni (arXiv:1302.5503) there is a gap in the
proof of the theorem of Balister et al. (Longest paths in circular arc graphs,
Combin. Probab. Comput., 13, No. 3, 311-317 (2004)), which states that the
intersection of all longest paths in a connected circular arc graph is
nonempty. In this paper we close this gap.
