We investigate the quantum-mechanical interpretation of models with
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and real spectra. After describing a general
framework to reformulate such models in terms of Hermitian Hamiltonians defined
on the Hilbert space $L_2(-\infty,\infty)$, we discuss the significance of the
algebra of physical observables.
