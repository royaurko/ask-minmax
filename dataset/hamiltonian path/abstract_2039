The single-source shortest path problem is a classical problem in the
research field of graph algorithm. In this paper, a new single-source shortest
path algorithm for nonnegative weight graph is proposed. The algorithm can
compress multi-round Fibonacci heap operations to one round to save running
time relative to Dijkstra's algorithm using Fibonacci heap. The time complexity
of the algorithm is also O(m+nlogn) in the worst case, where m is the number of
edges and n is the number of nodes. However, the bound can be linear in some
case, for example, when edge weights of a graph are all the same and the hop
count of the longest shortest path is much less than n.Based on the theoretical
analyses, we demonstrate that the algorithm is faster than Dijkstra's algorithm
using Fibonacci heap in average situation when n is large enough.
