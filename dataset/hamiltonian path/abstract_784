The sequence of random probability measures $\nu_n$ that gives a path of
length $n$, $\unsur{n}$ times the sum of the random weights collected along the
paths, is shown to satisfy a large deviations principle with good rate function
the Legendre transform of the free energy of the associated directed polymer in
a random environment. Consequences on the asymptotics of the typical number of
paths whose collected weight is above a fixed proportion are then drawn.
