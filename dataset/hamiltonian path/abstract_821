I discuss how a variatonal approach can be extended to systems of identical
particles (in particular fermions) within the path-integral treatment. The
applicability of the many-body variational principle for path integrals is
illustrated for different model systems, and is shown to crucially depend on
whether or not a model system possesses the proper symmetry with respect to
permutations of identical particles.
