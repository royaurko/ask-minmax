We show that the specific operators V^a appearing in the triplectic formalism
can be viewed as the anti-Hamiltonian vector fields generated by a second rank
irreducible Sp(2) tensor. This allows for an explicit realization of the
triplectic algebra being constructed from an arbitrary Poisson bracket on the
space of the fields only, equipped by the flat Poisson connection. We show that
the whole space of fields and antifields can be equipped with an even
supersymplectic structure when this Poisson bracket is non-degenerate. This
observation opens the possibility to provide the BRST/antiBRST path integral by
a well-defined integration measure, as well as to establish a direct link
between the Sp(2) symmetric Lagrangian and Hamiltonian BRST quantization
schemes.
