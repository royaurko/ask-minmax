Results of experimental study of the weak localization phenomenon in 2D
system with artificial inhomogeneity of potential relief are presented. It is
shown that the shape of the magnetoconductivity curve is determined by the
statistics of closed paths. The area distribution function of closed paths has
been obtained using the Fourier transformation of the magnetoconductivity
curves taken at different temperatures. The experimental results are found in a
qualitative agreement with the results of computer simulation.
