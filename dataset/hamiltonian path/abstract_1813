In the framework of the density functional theory a new electronegativity
formulation via the Feynman-Kleinert path integral formalism in the markovian
limit is proposed. The computation of the electronic density follows, in terms
of partition function, the same procedure of the Levy constrained-search for
the wave function. The obtained electronegativity scale seems to respect the
main criteria largely used for its acceptability.
