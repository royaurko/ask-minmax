Let $\{X(v), v \in \Bbb Z^d \times \Bbb Z_+\}$ be an i.i.d. family of random
variables such that $P\{X(v)= e^b\}=1-P\{X(v)= 1\} = p$ for some $b>0$. We
consider paths $\pi \subset \Bbb Z^d \times \Bbb Z_+$ starting at the origin
and with the last coordinate increasing along the path, and of length $n$.
Define for such paths $W(\pi) = \text{number of vertices $\pi_i, 1 \le i \le
n$, with}X(\pi_i) = e^b$. Finally let $N_n(\al) = \text{number of paths $\pi$
of length $n$ starting at $\pi_0 = \bold 0$ and with $W(\pi) \ge \al n$.}$ We
establish several properties of $\lim_{n \to \infty} [N_n]^{1/n}$.
