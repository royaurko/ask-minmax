We construct a path model for geometric crystals in the sense of Berenstein
and Kazhdan. Our model is in every way similar to Littelmann's and tropicalizes
to his path model. This paper lays the foundational material for a subsequent
work where we examine the measure induced on geometric crystals by Brownian
motion.
  If we call Berenstein and Kazhdan's realization of geometric crystals the
group picture, we prove that the path model projects onto the group picture
thanks to a morphism of crystals that restricts to an isomorphism on connected
components. This projection is in fact the geometric analogue of the
Robinson-Schensted correspondence and involves solving a left-invariant
differential equation on the Borel subgroup.
  Moreover, we identify the geometric Pitman transform $\mathcal{T}_{w_0}$
introduced by Biane, Bougerol and O'Connell as the transform giving the path
with highest weight, in the geometric crystal path model. This allows to prove
a geometric version of Littelmann's independence theorem. The geometric
Robinson-Schensted correspondence is detailed in a special section, because of
its importance.
  Finally, we exhibit the Kashiwara and Sch\"utzenberger involutions in both
the group picture and the path model.
  In an appendix, we explain how the left-invariant flow is related to the
image of the Casimir element in Kostant's Whittaker model.
