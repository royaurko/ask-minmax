We reelaborate on a general method for obtaining effective Hamiltonians that
describe different nonlinear optical processes. The method exploits the
existence of a nonlinear deformation of the su(2) algebra that arises as the
dynamical symmetry of the original model. When some physical parameter (usually
related to the dispersive limit) becomes small, we immediately get a diagonal
effective Hamiltonian that represents correctly the dynamics for arbitrary
states and long times. We apply the same technique to obtain how the noise
terms in the original model transform under this scheme, providing a systematic
way of including damping effects in processes described in terms of effective
Hamiltonians.
