It is shown that a class of dynamical systems (encompassing the one recently
considered by F. Calogero [J. Math. Phys. 37 (1996) 1735]) is both
quasi-bi-Hamiltonian and bi-Hamiltonian. The first formulation entails the
separability of these systems; the second one is obtained trough a non
canonical map whose form is directly suggested by the associated Nijenhuis
tensor.
