We investigate heavy fermion behaviors in the vanadium spinel LiV_2O_4. We
start from a three-orbital Hubbard model on the pyrochlore lattice and derive
its low-energy effective Hamiltonian by an approach of real-space
renormalization group type. One important tetrahedron configuration in the
rochlore lattice has a three-fold orbital degeneracy and spin S=1, and
correspondingly, the effective Hamiltonian has spin and orbital exchange
interactions of Kugel-Khomskii type as well as correlated electron hoppings.
Analyzing the effective Hamiltonian, we find that ferromagnetic double exchange
processes compete with antiferromagnetic superexchange processes and various
spin and orbital exchange processes are competing to each other. These results
suggest the absence of phase transition in spin and orbital spaces down to very
low temperatures and their large fluctuations in the low-energy sector, which
are key issues for understanding the heavy fermion behavior in LiV_2O_4.
