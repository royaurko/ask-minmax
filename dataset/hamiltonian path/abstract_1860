This paper deals with the question of analytic continuation of holonomy germs
of holomorphic foliations. We prove that for a quasi-minimal Riccati foliation
of the complex projective plane, any holonomy germ of the foliation between
complex projective lines can be analytically continued along a generic Brownian
path.
