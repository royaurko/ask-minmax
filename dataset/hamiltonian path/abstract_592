We show that the long exact sequence for K-groups of Leavitt path algebras
deduced by Ara, Brustenga, and Cortinas extends to Leavitt path algebras of
countable graphs with infinite emitters in the obvious way. Using this long
exact sequence, we compute explicit formulas for the higher algebraic K-groups
of Leavitt path algebras over certain fields, including all finite fields and
all algebraically closed fields. We also examine classification of Leavitt path
algebras using K-theory. It is known that the K_0-group and K_1-group do not
suffice to classify purely infinite simple unital Leavitt path algebras of
infinite graphs up to Morita equivalence when the underlying field is the
rational numbers. We prove for these Leavitt path algebras, if the underlying
field is a number field (which includes the case when the field is the rational
numbers), then the pair consisting of the K_0-group and the K_6-group does
suffice to classify these Leavitt path algebras up to Morita equivalence.
