We solve the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations for a spherical mean
field and a pairing potential with the inverse Hamiltonian method, which we
have developed for the solution of the Dirac equation. This method is based on
the variational principle for the inverse Hamiltonian, and is applicable to
Hamiltonians that are bound neither from above nor below. We demonstrate that
the method works well not only for the Dirac but also for the HFB equations.
