We apply the method of two-point quasiclassical Green's function to
geometries where the trajectories include interfering paths and loops. For a
system of two superconducting layers separated by partially transparent
interface, corrections to the quasiclassical solutions for the Green's function
are explicitly found as well as the deviation from the normalization condition.
