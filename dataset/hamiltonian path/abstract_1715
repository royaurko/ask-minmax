We construct for each separated graph (E;C) a family of branching systems
over a set X and show how each branching system induces a representation of the
Cohn-Leavitt path algebra associated to (E;C) as homomorphisms over the module
of functions in X. We also prove that the abelianized Cohn-Leavitt path algebra
of a separated graph with no loops can be written as an amalgamated free
product of abelianized Cohn-Leavitt algebras that can be faithfully represented
via branching systems.
