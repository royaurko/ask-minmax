We present a family of algorithms for the fast determination of reaction
paths and barriers in phase space and the computation of the corresponding
rates. The method requires the reaction times be large compared to the
microscopic time, irrespective of the origin - energetic, entropic, cooperative
- of the timescale separation. It lends itself to temperature cycling as in
simulated annealing and to activation-relaxation routines. The dynamics is
ultimately based on supersymmetry methods used years ago to derive Morse
theory. Thus, the formalism automatically incorporates all relevant topological
information.
