A big-isotropic structure $E$ is an isotropic subbundle of $TM\oplus T^*M$,
endowed with the metric defined by pairing. The structure $E$ is said to be
integrable if the Courant bracket $[\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}]\in\Gamma E$,
$\forall\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}\in\Gamma E$. Then, necessarily, one also has
$[\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Z}]\in\Gamma E^\perp$, $\forall\mathcal{Z}\in\Gamma
E^\perp$ \cite{V-iso}. A weak-Hamiltonian dynamical system is a vector field
$X_H$ such that $(X_H,dH)\in E^\perp$ $(H\in C^\infty(M))$. We obtain the
explicit expression of $X_H$ and of the integrability conditions of $E$ under
the regularity condition $dim(pr_{T^*M}E)=const.$ We show that the
port-controlled, Hamiltonian systems (in particular, constrained mechanics)
\cite{{BR},{DS}} may be interpreted as weak-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we
give reduction theorems for weak-Hamiltonian systems and a corresponding
corollary for constrained mechanical systems.
