In this thesis, we try to treat the problem of oriented paths in n-chromatic
digraphs. We first treat the case of antidirected paths in 5-chromatic
digraphs, where we explain El-Sahili's theorem and provide an elementary and
shorter proof of it. We then treat the case of paths with two blocks in
n-chromatic digraphs with n greater than 4, where we explain the two different
approaches of Addario-Berry et al. and of El-Sahili. We indicate a mistake in
Addario-Berry et al.'s proof and provide a correction for it.
