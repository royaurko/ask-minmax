We return to the question of how the choice of stabilizer generators affects
the preservation of information on structures whose degenerate ground state
encodes a classical redundancy code. Controlled-not gates are used to transform
the stabilizer Hamiltonian into a Hamiltonian consisting of uncoupled single
spins and/or pairs of spins. This transformation allows us to obtain an
analytical partition function and derive closed form equations for the relative
magnetization and susceptibility. These equations are in agreement with the
numerical results presented in [arXiv:0907.0394v1] for finite size systems.
Analytical solutions show that there is no finite critical temperature, Tc=0,
for all of the memory structures in the thermodynamic limit. This is in
contrast to the previously predicted finite critical temperatures based on
extrapolation. The mismatch is a result of the infinite system being a poor
approximation even for astronomically large finite size systems, where
spontaneous magnetization still arises below an apparent finite critical
temperature. We extend our analysis to the canonical stabilizer Hamiltonian.
Interestingly, Hamiltonians with two-body interactions have a higher apparent
critical temperature than the many-body Hamiltonian.
