Dual-Path is an anonymous peer-to-peer approach which provides requester
anonymity. This approach provides anonymity between a requester and a provider
in peer-to-peer networks with trusted servers called suppernode so the provider
will not be able to identify the requester and no other peers can identify the
two communicating parties with certainty. Dual-Path establishes two paths for
transmitting data. These paths called Request path and Response path. The first
one is used for requesting data and the second one is used for sending the
requested data to the requester. As Dual-Path approach is similar to Crowds
approach, this article compares reliability and performance of Dual-Path and
Crowds. For this purpose a simulator is developed and several scenarios are
defined to compare Dual-Path and Crowds in different situations. In chapter 2
and 3 Dual-Path and Crowds approaches are briefly described. Chapter 4 is
talking about simulator. Chapter 5 explains the scenarios for comparison of
performance. Chapter 6 is about comparison of reliability and chapter 7 is
conclusion.
