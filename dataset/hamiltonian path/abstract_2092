The rotational invariance under the usual physical angular momentum of the
SUq(2) Hamiltonian for the description of rotational nuclear spectra is
explicitly proved and a connection of this Hamiltonian to the formalisms of
Amal'sky and Harris is provided. In addition, a new Hamiltonian for rotational
spectra is introduced, based on the construction of irreducible tensor
operators (ITO) under SUq(2) and use of q-deformed tensor products and
q-deformed Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The rotational invariance of this
SUq(2) ITO Hamiltonian under the usual physical angular momentum is explicitly
proved, a simple closed expression for its energy spectrum (the ``hyperbolic
tangent formula'') is introduced, and its connection to the Harris formalism is
established. Numerical tests in a series of Th isotopes are provided.
