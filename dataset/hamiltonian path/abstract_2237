We study the gauge fixing of lattice QCD in 2+1 dimensions, in the
Hamiltonian formulation. The technique easily generalizes to other theories and
dimensions. The Hamiltonian is rewritten in terms of variables which are gauge
invariant except under a single global transformation. This paper extends
previous work, involving only pure gauge theories, to include matter fields.
