Assume that a Hamiltonian system is monotone. In this paper, we give several
characterizations on when such a system is Anosov. Assuming that a monotone
Hamiltonian system has no conjugate point, we show that there are two
distributions which are invariant under the Hamiltonian flow. We show that a
monotone Hamiltonian flow without conjugate point is Anosov if and only if
these distributions are transversal. We also show that if the reduced curvature
of the Hamiltonian system is non-positive, then the flow is Anosov if and only
if the reduced curvature is negative somewhere along each trajectory.
