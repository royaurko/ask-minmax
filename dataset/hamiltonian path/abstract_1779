We study a new spacetime which is shown to be the general geometrical
background for Thermal Field Theories at equilibrium. The different formalisms
of Thermal Field Theory are unified in a simple way in this spacetime. The set
of time-paths used in the Path Ordered Method is interpreted in geometrical
terms.
