This paper addresses the problem of binaural speech sound source localization
(SSL) in noisy and reverberant environments. For the binaural setup, the array
response corresponding to the direct-path sound propagation of a single source
is a function of the source direction. In practice, this response is
contaminated by noise and reverberation. The direct-path relative transfer
function (DP-RTF) is defined as the ratio between the direct-path acoustic
transfer function (ATF) of the two channels, and it is an important feature for
SSL. We propose a method to estimate the DP-RTF from the noisy and reverberant
sensor signals in the short time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. First, the
convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation is adopted to accurately
represent the impulse response of the sensor array in the STFT domain. The
first element of the CTF is mainly composed of the direct-path ATF. The DP-RTF
is then estimated by using the auto and cross power spectral density (PSD) of
multiple STFT frames at each frequency. In the presence of stationary noise, an
inter-frame spectral subtraction algorithm is proposed, which enables to
achieve the estimation of noise-free auto and cross PSD. Finally, the estimated
DP-RTFs are concatenated across frequency and used as a feature vector for SSL.
Experiments show that the resulting SSL method performs well even under severe
adverse acoustic condition, and outperforms the comparison methods under most
of the acoustic conditions.
