We investigate the sensitivity of a disordered system with diffractive
scatterers to a weak external perturbation. Specifically, we calculate the
fidelity M(t) (also called the Loschmidt echo) characterizing a return
probability after a propagation for a time $t$ followed by a backward
propagation governed by a slightly perturbed Hamiltonian. For short-range
scatterers we perform a diagrammatic calculation showing that the fidelity
decays first exponentially according to the golden rule, and then follows a
power law governed by the diffusive dynamics. For long-range disorder (when the
diffractive scattering is of small-angle character) an intermediate regime
emerges where the diagrammatics is not applicable. Using the path integral
technique, we derive a kinetic equation and show that M(t) decays exponentially
with a rate governed by the classical Lyapunov exponent.
