The first seven sections of the paper contain a version of localization for
the norm-square of the moment map in equivariant de Rham theory, similar to
that proved by P.-E. Paradan. The last section contains a definition and
computation of the Yang-Mills path integral in two dimensions. The idea is to
reverse the logic in Witten's paper and take the localization formula as the
definition of the path integral. Using a symmetry argument we show that the
path integral is given by the Migdal formula.
