The exact solution of proton-neutron isoscalar-isovector (T=0,1) pairing
Hamiltonian with non-degenerate single-particle orbits and equal pairing
strengths (g_{T=1}= g_{T=0}) is presented for the first time. The Hamiltonian
is a particular case of a family of integrable SO(8) Richardson-Gaudin (RG)
models. The exact solution of the T=0,1 pairing Hamiltonian is reduced to a
problem of 4 sets of coupled non linear equations that determine the spectral
parameters of the complete set of eigenstates. The microscopic structure of
individual eigenstates is analyzed in terms of evolution of the spectral
parameters in the complex plane for system of A=80 nucleons. The spectroscopic
trends of the exact solutions are discussed in terms of generalized rotations
in isospace.
