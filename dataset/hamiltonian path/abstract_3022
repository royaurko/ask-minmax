In a recent paper \cite{EH} Eriksen and Hedegard (EH) claimed that they
``clarified'' our path integral calculation \cite{GZ1} and found an error in
our analysis. Here we will demonstrate that this claim is based on
mathematically incorrect and physically meaningless procedure invented by the
contributors \cite{EH}. The main problem in the EH analysis is due to their
erroneous calculation of Gaussian path integrals and has nothing to do with the
momentum recoil of a particle interacting with an external bath.
