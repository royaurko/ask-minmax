We consider the numerical simulation of Hamiltonian systems of ordinary
differential equations. Two features of Hamiltonian systems are that energy is
conserved along trajectories and phase space volume is preserved by the flow.
We want to determine if there are integration schemes that preserve these two
properties for all Hamiltonian systems, or at least for all systems in a wide
class. This paper provides provides a negative result in the case of two
dimensional (one degree of freedom) Hamiltonian systems, for which phase space
volume is identical to area. Our main theorem shows that there are no
computationally reasonable numerical integrators for which all Hamiltonian
systems of one degree of freedom can be integrated while conserving both area
and energy. Before proving this result we define what we mean by a
computationally reasonable integrator. We then consider what obstructions this
result places on the existence of volume- and energy-conserving integrators for
Hamiltonian systems with an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom.
