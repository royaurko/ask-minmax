We show that under certain technical assumptions any weakly nonlocal
Hamiltonian structure compatible with a given nondegenerate weakly nonlocal
symplectic structure $J$ can be written as the Lie derivative of $J^{-1}$ along
a suitably chosen nonlocal vector field. Moreover, we present a new description
for local Hamiltonian structures of arbitrary order compatible with a given
nondegenerate local Hamiltonian structure of zero or first order, including
Hamiltonian operators of the Dubrovin-Novikov type.
