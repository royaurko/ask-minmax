We study a similarity transformation to construct an effective Hamiltonian
systematically, which does not contain particle-number-changing interactions,
by means of Fukuda-Sawada-Taketani-Okubo's method. We show that such
Hamiltonian can be constructed from Feynman diagrams and give rules for
constructing it in the Light-Front Yukawa model. We prove that it is
renormalized by the familiar covariant perturbative renormalization procedure.
It is very advantageous that the effective Hamiltonian can be obtained from our
rules {\em immediately}. We also numerically diagonalize it to the second order
in the coupling constant as an exercise.
