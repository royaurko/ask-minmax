We propose a variant formulation of Hamiltonian systems by the use of
variables including redundant degrees of freedom. We show that Hamiltonian
systems can be described by extended dynamics whose master equation is the
Nambu equation or its generalization. Partition functions associated with the
extended dynamics in many degrees of freedom systems are given. Our formulation
can also be applied to Hamiltonian systems with first class constraints.
