We study a family of Hamiltonians of fermions hopping on a set of lattices in
the presence of a background gauge field. The lattices are constructed by
decorating the root lattices of various Lie algebras with their minuscule
representations. The Hamiltonians are, in momentum space, themselves elements
of the Lie algebras in these same representations. We describe various
interesting aspects of the spectra--which exhibit a family resemblance to the
Dirac spectrum, and in many cases are able to relate them to known facts about
the relevant Lie algebras. Interestingly, various realizable lattices such as
the kagom\'{e} and pyrochlore can be given this Lie algebraic interpretation
and the particular flux Hamiltonians arise as mean-field Hamiltonians for
spin-1/2 Heisenberg models on these lattices.
