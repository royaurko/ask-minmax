We derive an effective spin Hamiltonian for the one-dimensional half-filled
asymmetric ionic Hubbard model with alternating on-site interaction in the
limit of strong repulsion. It is shown that the effective Hamiltonian is that
of a spin $S=1/2$ anisotropic $XXZ$ Heisenberg chain with alternating
next-nearest-neighbor and three-spin couplings in the presence of a uniform and
a staggered magnetic field.
