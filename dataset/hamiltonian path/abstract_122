Maximization of the path information entropy is a clear prescription for
constructing models in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Here it is shown
that, following this prescription under the assumption of arbitrary
instantaneous constraints on position and velocity, a Lagrangian emerges which
determines the most probable trajectory. Deviations from the probability
maximum can be consistently described as slices in time by a Hamiltonian,
according to a nonlinear Langevin equation and its associated Fokker-Planck
equation. The connections unveiled between the maximization of path entropy and
the Langevin/Fokker-Planck equations imply that missing information about the
phase space coordinate never decreases in time, a purely
information-theoretical version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. All of
these results are independent of any physical assumptions, and thus valid for
any generalized coordinate as a function of time, or any other parameter. This
reinforces the view that the Second Law is a fundamental property of plausible
inference.
