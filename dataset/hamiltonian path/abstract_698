Liouville integrable systems, which have bi-Hamiltonian representation of the
Gel'fand-Zakharevich type, are considered. Bi-presymplectic representation of
one-Casimir bi-Hamiltonian chains and weakly bi-presymplectic representation of
multi-Casimir bi-Hamiltonian chains are constructed. The reduction procedure
for Poisson and presymplectic structures is presented.
