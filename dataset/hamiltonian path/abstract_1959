Path integral formulations for gauge theories must start from the canonical
formulation in order to obtain the correct measure. A possible avenue to derive
it is to start from the reduced phase space formulation. In this article we
review this rather involved procedure in full generality. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the reduced phase space path integral formulation formally
agrees with the Dirac's operator constraint quantisation and, more
specifically, with the Master constraint quantisation for first class
constraints. For first class constraints with non trivial structure functions
the equivalence can only be established by passing to Abelian(ised) constraints
which is always possible locally in phase space. Generically, the correct
configuration space path integral measure deviates from the exponential of the
Lagrangian action. The corrections are especially severe if the theory suffers
from second class secondary constraints. In a companion paper we compute these
corrections for the Holst and Plebanski formulations of GR on which current
spin foam models are based.
