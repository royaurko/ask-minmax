We consider the question of when the $n$-dimensional hypercube can be
decomposed into paths of length $k$. Mollard and Ramras \cite{MR2013} noted
that for odd $n$ it is necessary that $k$ divides $n2^{n-1}$ and that $k\leq
n$. Later, Anick and Ramras \cite{AR2013} showed that these two conditions are
also sufficient for odd $n \leq 2^{32}$ and conjectured that this was true for
all odd $n$. In this note we prove the conjecture.
