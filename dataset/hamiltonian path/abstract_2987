Two dimensional massless Dirac Hamiltonian under the influence of hyperbolic
magnetic fields is mentioned in curved space. Using a spherical surface
parametrization, the Dirac operator on the sphere is presented and the system
is given as two supersymmetric partner Hamiltonians which coincides with the
position dependent mass Hamiltonians. We introduce two ansatzes for the
component of the vector potential to acquire effective solvable models, which
are Rosen Morse II potential and the model given in \cite{mid} whose bound
states are Jacobi $X_1$ type polynomials, and we adapt our work to these
special models under some parameter restrictions. The energy spectrum and the
eigenvectors are found for Rosen Morse II potential. On the other hand,
complete solutions are given for the second system. The vector and the
effective potentials with their eigenvalues are sketched for each system.
