Field correlators are expressed using background field formalism through the
gluelump Green's functions. The latter are obtained in the path integral and
Hamiltonian formalism. As a result behaviour of field correlators is obtained
at small and large distances both for perturbative and nonperturbative parts.
The latter decay exponentially at large distances and are finite at x=0, in
agreement with OPE and lattice data.
