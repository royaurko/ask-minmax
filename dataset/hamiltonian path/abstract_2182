Directed paths have been used extensively in the scientific literature as a
model of a linear polymer. Such paths models in particular the conformational
entropy of a linear polymer and the effects it has on the free energy. These
directed models are simplified versions of the self-avoiding walk, but they do
nevertheless give insight into the phase behaviour of a polymer, and also serve
as a tool to study the effects of conformational degrees of freedom in the
behaviour of a linear polymer. In this paper we examine a directed path model
of a linear polymer in a confining geometry (a wedge). The main focus of our
attention is $c_n$, the number of directed lattice paths of length $n$ steps
which takes steps in the North-East and South-East directions and which is
confined to the wedge $Y=\pm X/p$, where $p$ is an integer. In this paper we
examine the case $p=2$ in detail, and we determine the generating function
using the iterated kernel method. We also examine the asymtotics of $c_n$. In
particular, we show that $$ c_n = [0.67874...]\times 2^{n-1}(1+(-1)^n) +
O((4/3^{3/4})^{n+o(n)}) + o((4/3^{3/4})^n) $$ where we can determine the
constant $0.67874...$ to arbitrary accuracy with little effort.
