An upper bound for the number of Hamiltonian cycles of symmetric diagraphs is
established first in this paper, which is tighter than the famous Minc's bound
and the Br$\acute{e}$gman's bound. A transformation on graphs is proposed, so
that counting the number of Hamiltonian cycles of an undirected graph can be
done by counting the number of Hamiltonian cycles of its corresponding
symmetric directed graph. In this way, an upper bound for the number of
Hamiltonian cycles of undirected graphs is also obtained.
