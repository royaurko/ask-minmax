Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian spheres in Kaehler-Einstein surfaces are
minimal. We prove that in the family of non-Einstein Kaehler surfaces given by
the product $\Sigma_1\times\Sigma_2$ of two complete orientable Riemannian
surfaces of different constant Gauss curvatures, there is only a (non minimal)
Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian sphere. This example is defined when the
surfaces $\Sigma_1$ and $ \Sigma_2$ are spheres.
