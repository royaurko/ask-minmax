This paper aims to describe the restricted Kac modules of restricted
Hamiltonian Lie superalgebras of odd type over an algebraically closed field of
characteristic $p>3$. In particular, a sufficient and necessary condition for
the restricted Kac modules to be irreducible is given in terms of typical
weights.
