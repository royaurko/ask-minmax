We present a superfield construction of Hamiltonian quantization with N=2
supersymmetry generated by two fermionic charges Q^a. As a byproduct of the
analysis we also derive a classically localized path integral from two
fermionic objects \Sigma^a that can be viewed as ``square roots'' of the
classical bosonic action under the product of a functional Poisson bracket.
