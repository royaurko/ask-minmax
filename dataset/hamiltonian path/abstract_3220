We study the path realization of Demazure crystals related to solvable
lattice models in statistical mechanics. Various characters are represented in
a unified way as the sums over one dimensional configurations which we call
unrestricted, classically restricted and restricted paths. As an application
characters of Demazure modules are obtained in terms of $q$-multinomial
coefficients for several level 1 modules of classical affine algebras.
