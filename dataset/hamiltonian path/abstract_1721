The nonperturbative probability of pair production in electric fields
depending on lightfront time is given exactly by the locally constant
approximation. We explain this by showing that the worldline path integral
defining the effective action contains a constraint, which localises
contributing paths on hypersurfaces of constant lightfront time. These paths
are lightfront zero-modes and there can be no pair production without them; the
effective action vanishes if they are projected out.
