Electron spin resonance and magnetization data in magnetic fields up to 55 T
of a novel multicenter paramagnetic molecular complex [L_2Ni_4(N_3)(O_2C
Ada)_4](Cl O_4) are reported. In this compound, four Ni centers each having a
spin S = 1 are coupled in a single molecule via bridging ligands (including a
\mu_4-azide) which provide paths for magnetic exchange. Analysis of the
frequency and temperature dependence of the ESR signals yields the relevant
parameters of the spin Hamiltonian, in particular the single ion anisotropy gap
and the g factor, which enables the calculation of the complex energy spectrum
of the spin states in a magnetic field. The experimental results give
compelling evidence for tuning the ground state of the molecule by magnetic
field from a nonmagnetic state at small fields to a magnetic one in strong
fields owing to the spin level crossing at a field of ~25 T.
