We introduce a differential structure for the space of weakly geometric p
rough paths over a Banach space V for 2<p<3. We begin by considering a certain
natural family of smooth rough paths and differentiating in the truncated
tensor series. The resulting object has a clear interpretation, even for
non-smooth rough paths, which we take to be an element of the tangent space. We
can associate it uniquely to an equivalence class of curves, with equivalence
defined by our differential structure. Thus, for a functional on rough path
space, we can define the derivative in a tangent direction analogous to
defining the derivative in a Cameron-Martin direction of a functional on Wiener
space. Our tangent space contains many more directions than the Cameron-Martin
space and we do not require quasi-invariance of Wiener measure. In addition we
also locally (globally) solve the associated flow equation for a class of
vector fields satisfying a local (global) Lipshitz type condition.
