Properties of the space $\Ab$ of generalized connections in the Ashtekar
framework are investigated.
  First a construction method for new connections is given. The new parallel
transports differ from the original ones only along paths that pass an initial
segment of a fixed path. This is closely related to a new notion of path
independence. Although we do not restrict ourselves to the immersive smooth or
analytical case, any finite set of paths depends on a finite set of independent
paths, a so-called hyph. This generalizes the well-known directedness of the
set of smooth webs and that of analytical graphs, respectively.
  Due to these propositions, on the one hand, the projections from $\Ab$ to the
lattice gauge theory are surjective and open. On the other hand, an induced
Haar measure can be defined for every compact structure group irrespective of
the used smoothness category for the paths.
