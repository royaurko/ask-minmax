The exact path integration for a family of maximally super-integrable systems
generalizing the hydrogen atom in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space is
presented. The Green's function is calculated in parabolic rotational and
spherical coordinate systems. The energy spectrum and the correctly normalized
wave functions of the bound states are obtained from the poles of the Green's
function and their residues, respectively.
