The heat kernel for the Cauchy-Riemann subLaplacian on S(2n+1) is derived in
a manner which is completely analogous to the classical derivation of elliptic
heat kernels. This suggests that the classical hamiltonian construction of
elliptic heat kernels, with appropriate modifications, does yield heat kernels
for subelliptic operators.
