In this paper, we show that the ability to switch globally between two
2-local Hamiltonians on n qubits is sufficient for achieving universal unitary
dynamics on those n qubits. Of the two Hamiltonians used in the construction,
one is comprised of nearest-neighbour two-qubit interactions on a
one-dimensional chain, the other is comprised of single-qubit interactions. We
describe a scheme for choosing the switching times in order to generate
arbitrary one- and two-qubit gates on the n qubits. However the switching
scheme is inefficient, and we leave as an open problem the question of whether
the universality of the Hamiltonians can be exploited in an efficient way.
