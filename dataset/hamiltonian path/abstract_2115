We consider two-loop anomalous dimensions for fermionic operators in the ABJM
model and the ABJ model. We find the appropriate Hamiltonian and show that it
is consistent with a previously predicted Bethe ansatz for the ABJM model. The
difference between the ABJ and ABJM models is invisible at the two-loop level
by cancelation of parity violating diagrams. We then construct a Hamiltonian
for the full two-loop OSp(6|4) spin chain by first constructing the Hamiltonian
for an SL(2|1) subgroup, and then lifting to OSp(6|4). We show that this
Hamiltonian is consistent with the Hamiltonian found for the fermionic
operators.
