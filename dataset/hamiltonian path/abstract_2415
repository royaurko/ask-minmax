The aim of this paper is to study the relationship between Hamiltonian
dynamics and constrained variational calculus. We describe both using the
notion of Lagrangian submanifolds of convenient symplectic manifolds and using
the so-called Tulczyjew's triples. The results are also extended to the case of
discrete dynamics and nonholonomic mechanics. Interesting applications to
geometrical integration of Hamiltonian systems are obtained.
