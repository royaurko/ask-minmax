We use the Dunkl operator approach to construct one dimensional integrable
models describing N particles with internal degrees of freedom. These models
are described by a general Hamiltonian belonging to the center of the Yangian
or the reflection algebra, which ensures that they admit the corresponding
symmetry. In particular, the open problem of the symmetry is answered for the
B_N-type Sutherland model with spin and a generalized B_N-type nonlinear
Schrodinger Hamiltonian.
