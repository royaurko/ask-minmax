We construct a parent Hamiltonian for the family of non-Abelian chiral spin
liquids proposed recently by two of us [PRL 102, 207203 (2009)], which includes
the Abelian chiral spin liquid proposed by Kalmeyer and Laughlin, as the
special case S=1/2. As we use a circular disk geometry with an open boundary,
both the annihilation operators we identify and the Hamiltonians we construct
from these are exact only in the thermodynamic limit.
