We present a numerical technique for calculating path integrals in
non-compact U(1) and SU(2) gauge theories. The gauge fields are represented by
a superposition of pseudoparticles of various types with their amplitudes and
color orientations as degrees of freedom. Applied to Maxwell theory this
technique results in a potential which is in excellent agreement with the
Coulomb potential. For SU(2) Yang-Mills theory the same technique yields clear
evidence of confinement. Varying the coupling constant exhibits the same
scaling behavior for the string tension, the topological susceptibility and the
critical temperature while their dimensionless ratios are similar to those
obtained in lattice calculations.
