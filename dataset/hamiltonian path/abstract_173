Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices. An induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ is called
heavy if there exist two nonadjacent vertices in $H$ with degree sum at least
$n$ in $G$. We say that $G$ is $H$-heavy if every induced subgraph of $G$
isomorphic to $H$ is heavy. For a family $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, $G$ is called
$\mathcal{H}$-heavy if $G$ is $H$-heavy for every $H\in\mathcal{H}$. In this
paper we characterize all connected graphs $R$ and $S$ other than $P_3$ (the
path on three vertices) such that every 2-connected $\{R,S\}$-heavy graph is
Hamiltonian. This extends several previous results on forbidden subgraph
conditions for Hamiltonian graphs.
