This paper considers possible price paths of a financial security in an
idealized market. Its main result is that the variation index of typical price
paths is at most 2; in this sense, typical price paths are not rougher than
typical paths of Brownian motion. We do not make any stochastic assumptions and
only assume that the price path is positive and right-continuous. The
qualification "typical" means that there is a trading strategy (constructed
explicitly in the proof) that risks only one monetary unit but brings infinite
capital when the variation index of the realized price path exceeds 2. The
paper also reviews some known results for continuous price paths and lists
several open problems.
