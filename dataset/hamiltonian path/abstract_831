We study an extension of the procedure to construct duality transformations
among abelian gauge theories to the non abelian case using a path space
formulation. We define a pre-dual functional in path space and introduce a
particular non local map among Lie algebra valued 1-form functionals that
reduces to the ordinary Hodge-* duality map of the abelian theories. Further,
we establish a full set of equations on path space representing the ordinary
Yang Mills equations and Bianchi identities of non abelian gauge theories of
4-dimensional euclidean space.
