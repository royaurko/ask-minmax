It is shown that the radial part of the Hydrogen Hamiltonian factorizes as
the product of two not mutually adjoint first order differential operators plus
a complex constant epsilon. The 1-susy approach is used to construct
non-hermitian Hamiltonians with hydrogen spectra. Other non-hermitian
Hamiltonians are shown to admit an extra `complex energy' at epsilon. New
self-adjoint hydrogen-like Hamiltonians are also derived by using a 2-susy
transformation with complex conjugate pairs epsilon, (c.c) epsilon.
