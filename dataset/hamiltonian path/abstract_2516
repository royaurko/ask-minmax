A renormalization-group and bosonization approach for a multi-band Hubbard
Hamiltonian in one dimension is described. Based on the limit of many bands, it
is argued that this Hamiltonian with bare repulsive electron-electron
interactions is scaled under specific conditions to a model in which
superconducting fluctuations dominate.
