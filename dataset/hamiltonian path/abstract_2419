In this paper we construct a distinguished Riemannian geometrization on the
dual 1-jet space J^{1*}(T,M) for the multi-time quadratic Hamiltonian
functions. Our geometrization includes a nonlinear connection N, a generalized
Cartan canonical N-linear connection (together with its local d-torsions and
d-curvatures), naturally provided by a given quadratic Hamiltonian function
depending on polymomenta.
