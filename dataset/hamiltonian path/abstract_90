The HLE theorem is proven for effective Lagrangians with arbitrary
interactions of scalars, fermions, massless and massive vector bosons. This
theorem states that the correct Hamiltonian path intergral formalism is
equivalent to the convenient Lagrangian path integral ansatz. In particular,
this theorem is valid for effective gauge theories, which justifies
Faddeev-Popov quantization of these theories. Specific attention is paid to
effective interactions of massive vector fields, which can be embedded within
gauge noninvariant theories or within spontaneously broken gauge theories.
These different types of models are related to each other by the Stuckelberg
formalism, which is reformulated within the Hamiltonian formalism. Effective
Lagrangians with higher derivatives of the fields are also considered. The HLE
theorem is even valid in this case because each effective higher-order
Lagrangian can be reduced to a first-order one by applying the equations of
motion to the effective interaction term. This thesis is essentially a
combination of previous publications of the contributor.
