The recently introduced condition-number-regularized covariance estimation
method (CondReg) has been demonstrated to be highly useful for estimating
high-dimensional covariance matrices. Unlike L1-regularized estimators, this
approach has the added advantage that no sparsity assumptions are made. The
regularization path of the lasso solution has received much attention in the
literature. Despite their importance, the solution paths of covariance
estimators however have not been considered in much detail. In this paper, we
provide a complete characterization of the entire solution path of the CondReg
estimator. Our characterization of the solution path has important applications
as it yields fast algorithms that compute the CondReg estimates for all
possible values of the regularization parameter at the same cost as that for a
single fixed parameter. We present two instances of fast algorithms: the
forward and the backward algorithms. These algorithms greatly speed up the
cross-validation procedure that selects the optimal regularization parameter.
Our new method is efficiently implemented with the R package CondReg.
