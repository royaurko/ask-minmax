We discuss some features of non-self-adjoint Hamiltonians with real discrete
simple spectrum under the assumption that the eigenvectors form a Riesz basis
of Hilbert space. Among other things, {we give conditions under which these
Hamiltonians} can be factorized in terms of generalized lowering and raising
operators.
