The first part of this work deals with a formalism of vector coherent states
construction for a system of $M$ Fermi-type modes associated with $N$ bosonic
modes. Then follows a generalization to a Hamiltonian describing the
translational motion of the center of mass of a nanoparticle. The latter gives
rise to a new mechanism for the electronic energy relaxation in nanocrystals,
intensively studied today in condensed matter physics. Finite degeneracies of
the involved Hamiltonian systems are also investigated. The defined vector
coherent states satisfy relevant mathematical properties of continuity,
resolution of identity, temporal stability and action identity.
