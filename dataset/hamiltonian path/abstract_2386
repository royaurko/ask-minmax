An algebraic analysis of the Hamiltonian formulation of the model
two-dimensional gravity is performed. The crucial fact is an exact coincidence
of the Poisson brackets algebra of the secondary constraints of this
Hamiltonian formulation with the SO(2,1)-algebra. The eigenvectors of the
canonical Hamiltonian $H_{c}$ are obtained and explicitly written in closed
form.
