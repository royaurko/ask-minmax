The paper [9] by Bocklandt, Schedler and Wemyss considers path algebras with
relations given by the higher derivations of a superpotential, giving a
condition for such an algebra to be Calabi-Yau. In this paper we extend these
results, giving a condition for a PBW deformation of a Calabi-Yau, Koszul path
algebra with relations given by a superpotential to have relations given by a
superpotential, and proving these are Calabi-Yau in certain cases.
  We apply our methods to symplectic reflection algebras, where we show that
every symplectic reflection algebra is Morita equivalent to a path algebra
whose relations are given by the higher derivations of an inhomogeneous
superpotential. In particular we show these are Calabi-Yau regardless of the
deformation parameter.
  Also, for G a finite subgroup of GL_2(C) not contained in SL_2(C), we
consider PBW deformations of a path algebra with relations which is Morita
equivalent to C[x,y] \rtimes G. We show there are no nontrivial PBW
deformations when G is a small subgroup.
