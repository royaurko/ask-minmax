Multivortex dynamics in Manton's Schroedinger--Chern--Simons variant of the
Landau-Ginzburg model of thin superconductors is studied within a moduli space
approximation. It is shown that the reduced flow on M_N, the N vortex moduli
space, is hamiltonian with respect to \omega_{L^2}, the L^2 Kaehler form on
\M_N. A purely hamiltonian discussion of the conserved momenta associated with
the euclidean symmetry of the model is given, and it is shown that the
euclidean action on (M_N,\omega_{L^2}) is not hamiltonian. It is argued that
the N=3 flow is integrable in the sense of Liouville. Asymptotic formulae for
\omega_{L^2} and the reduced Hamiltonian for large intervortex separation are
conjectured. Using these, a qualitative analysis of internal 3-vortex dynamics
is given and a spectral stability analysis of certain rotating vortex polygons
is performed. Comparison is made with the dynamics of classical fluid point
vortices and geostrophic vortices.
