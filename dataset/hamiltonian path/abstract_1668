We show how to transform a $d$-dimensional Euclidean path integral in terms
of two (Cartesian) fields to a path integral in terms of polar field variables.
First we present a conjecture that states how this transformation should be
done. Then we show that this conjecture is correct in the case of two toy
models. Finally the conjecture will be proven for a general QFT model with two
fields.
