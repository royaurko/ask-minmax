We apply classical algorithms for approximately solving constraint
satisfaction problems to find bounds on extremal eigenvalues of local
Hamiltonians. We consider qubit Hamiltonians for which we have an upper bound
on the number of terms in which each qubit participates, and find
asymptotically optimal bounds for the operator norm and ground-state energy of
such Hamiltonians under this constraint. In each case the bound is achieved by
a product state which can be found efficiently using a classical algorithm.
