Effective Lagrangians containing arbitrary interactions of massive vector
fields are quantized within the Hamiltonian path integral formalism. It is
proven that correct Hamiltonian quantization of these models yields the same
result as naive Lagrangian quantization (Matthews's theorem). This theorem
holds for models without gauge freedom as well as for (linearly or nonlinearly
realized) spontaneously broken gauge theories. The Stueckelberg formalism, a
procedure to rewrite effective Lagrangians in a gauge invariant way, is
reformulated within the Hamiltonian formalism as a transition from a second
class constrained theory to an equivalent first class constrained theory. The
relations between linearly and nonlinearly realized spontaneously broken gauge
theories are discussed. The quartically divergent Higgs self interaction is
derived from the Hamiltonian path integral.
