Gyrokinetic field theory is addressed in the context of a general
Hamiltonian. The background magnetic geometry is static and axisymmetric, and
all dependence of the Lagrangian upon dynamical variables is in the Hamiltonian
or in free field terms. Equations for the fields are given by functional
derivatives. The symmetry through the Hamiltonian with time and toroidal angle
invariance of the geometry lead to energy and toroidal momentum conservation.
In various levels of ordering against fluctuation amplitude, energetic
consistency is exact. The role of this in underpinning of conservation laws is
emphasised. Local transport equations for the vorticity, toroidal momentum, and
energy are derived. In particular, the momentum equation is shown for any form
of Hamiltonian to be well behaved and to relax to its magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
form when long wavelength approximations are taken in the Hamiltonian. Several
currently used forms, those which form the basis of most global simulations,
are shown to be well defined within the gyrokinetic field theory and energetic
consistency.
