We discuss stochastic calculus for large classes of Gaussian processes, based
on rough path analysis. Our key condition is a covariance measure structure
combined with a classical criterion due to Jain-Monrad [Ann. Probab. (1983)].
This condition is verified in many examples, even in absence of explicit
expressions for the covariance or Volterra kernels. Of special interest are
random Fourier series, with covariance given as Fourier series itself, and we
formulate conditions directly in terms of the Fourier coefficients. We also
establish convergence and rates of convergence in rough path metrics of
approximations to such random Fourier series. An application to SPDE is given.
Our criterion also leads to an embedding result for Cameron-Martin paths and
complementary Young regularity (CYR) of the Cameron-Martin space and Gaussian
sample paths. CYR is known to imply Malliavin regularity and also It\^o-like
probabilistic estimates for stochastic integrals (resp. stochastic differential
equations) despite their (rough) pathwise construction. At last, we give an
application in the context of non-Markovian H\"ormander theory. The results
include and extend those of [arXiv:1211.0046].
