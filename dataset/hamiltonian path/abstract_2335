A coupled AKNS-Kaup-Newell hierarchy of systems of soliton equations is
proposed in terms of hereditary symmetry operators resulted from Hamiltonian
pairs. Zero curvature representations and tri-Hamiltonian structures are
established for all coupled AKNS-Kaup-Newell systems in the hierarchy.
Therefore all systems have infinitely many commuting symmetries and
conservation laws. Two reductions of the systems lead to the AKNS hierarchy and
the Kaup-Newell hierarchy, and thus those two soliton hierarchies also possess
tri-Hamiltonian structures.
