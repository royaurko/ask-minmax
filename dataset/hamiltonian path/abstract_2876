A particle-core Hamiltonian is used to describe the lowest parity partner
bands $K^{\pi}=1/2^{\pm}$ in $^{237}$U and $^{239}$Pu. The quadrupole and
octupole boson Hamiltonian associated to the core is identical to the one
previously used for the description of four positive and four negative parity
bands in the neighboring even-even isotopes. The single particle space for the
odd nucleon consists of three spherical shell model states, two of positive and
one of negative parity. The particle-core Hamiltonian consists of four terms: a
quadrupole-quadrupole, an octupole-octupole, a spin-spin and a rotational
$\hat{I}^2$ interaction, with $\hat {I}$ denoting the total angular momentum.
The parameters involved in the particle-core coupling Hamiltonian were fixed by
fitting four particular energies in the two bands. The calculated excitation
energies are compared with the corresponding experimental data as well as with
those obtained with other approaches. Also, we searched for some signatures for
a static octupole deformation in the considered odd isotopes.
