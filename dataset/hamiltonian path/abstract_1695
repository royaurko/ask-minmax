The alternation of existential and universal quantifiers in a quantified
boolean formula (QBF) generates dependencies among variables that must be
respected when evaluating the formula. Dependency schemes provide a general
framework for representing such dependencies. Since it is generally intractable
to determine dependencies exactly, a set of potential dependencies is computed
instead, which may include false positives. Among the schemes proposed so far,
resolution-path dependencies introduce the fewest spurious dependencies. In
this work, we describe an algorithm that detects resolution-path dependencies
in linear time, resolving a problem posed by Van Gelder (CP 2011).
