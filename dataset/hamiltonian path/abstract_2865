We analyse a class of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which can be expressed
bilinearly in terms of generators of a sl(2,R)-Lie algebra or their isomorphic
su(1,1)-counterparts. The Hamlitonians are prototypes for solvable models of
Lie algebraic type. Demanding a real spectrum and the existence of a well
defined metric, we systematically investigate the constraints these
requirements impose on the coupling constants of the model and the parameters
in the metric operator. We compute isospectral Hermitian counterparts for some
of the original non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Alternatively we employ a
generalized Bogoliubov transformation, which allows to compute explicitly real
energy eigenvalue spectra for these type of Hamiltonians, together with their
eigenstates. We compare the two approaches.
