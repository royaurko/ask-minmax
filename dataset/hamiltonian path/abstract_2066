It has been proved by S.L.Ziglin, for a large class of 2-degree-of-freedom
(d.o.f) Hamiltonian systems, that transverse intersections of the invariant
manifolds of saddle fixed points imply infinite branching of solutions in the
complex time plane and the non-existence of a second analytic integral of the
motion. Here, we review in detail our recent results, following a similar
approach to show the existence of infinitely-sheeted solutions for 2 d.o.f.
Hamiltonians which exhibit, upon perturbation, subharmonic bifurcations of
resonant tori around an elliptic fixed point. Moreover, as shown recently,
these Hamiltonian systems are non-integrable if their resonant tori form a
dense set. These results can be extended to the case where the periodic
perturbation is not Hamiltonian.
