We generalize the "hamiltonian topology" on hamiltonian isotopies to an
intrinsic "symplectic topology" on the space of symplectic isotopies. We use it
to define the group $SSympeo(M,\omega)$ of strong symplectic homeomorphisms,
which generalizes the group $Hameo(M,\omega)$ of hamiltonian homeomorphisms
introduced by Oh and Muller. The group $SSympeo(M,\omega)$ is arcwise
connected, is contained in the identity component of $Sympeo(M,\omega)$; it
contains $Hameo(M,\omega)$ as a normal subgroup and coincides with it when $M$
is simply connected. Finally its commutator subgroup
$[SSympeo(M,\omega),SSympeo(M,\omega)]$ is contained in $Hameo(M,\omega)$.
