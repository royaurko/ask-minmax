Monotone path polytopes arise as a special case of the construction of fiber
polytopes, introduced by Billera and Sturmfels. A simple example is provided
by the permutahedron, which is a monotone path polytope of the standard unit
cube. The permutahedron is the zonotope polar to the braid arrangement. We
show how the zonotopes polar to the cones of certain deformations of the braid
arrangement can be realized as monotone path polytopes. The construction is an
extension of that of the permutahedron and yields interesting connections
between enumerative combinatorics of hyperplane arrangements and geometry of
monotone path polytopes.
