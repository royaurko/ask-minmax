A modified version of the Dijkstra algorithm using an inventive contraction
hierarchy is proposed. The algorithm considers a directed acyclic graph with a
conical or semi-circular structure for which a pair of edges is chosen
iteratively from multi-sources. The algorithm obtains minimum paths by using a
comparison process. The comparison process follows a mathematical construction
routine that considers a forward and backward check such that only paths with
minimum lengths are selected. In addition, the algorithm automatically invents
a new path by computing the absolute edge difference for the minimum edge pair
and its succeeding neighbour in O (n) time. The invented path is approximated
to the hidden path using a fitness criterion. The proposed algorithm extends
the multi-source multi-destination problem to include those paths for which a
path mining redirection from multi-sources to multi-destinations is a minimum.
The algorithm has been applied to a hospital locator path finding system and
the results were quite satisfactory.
