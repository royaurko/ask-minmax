We derive the Hamiltonian for cold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice
across a broad Feshbach resonance, taking into account of both multiband
occupations and neighboring-site collisions. Under typical configurations, the
resulting Hamiltonian can be dramatically simplified to an effective
single-band model, which describes a new type of resonance between the local
dressed molecules and the valence bond states of fermionic atoms at neighboring
sites. On different sides of such a resonance, the effective Hamiltonian is
reduced to either a t-J model for the fermionic atoms or an XXZ model for the
dressed molecules. The parameters in these models are experimentally tunable in
the full range, which allows for observation of various phase transitions.
