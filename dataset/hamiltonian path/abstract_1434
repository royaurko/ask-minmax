We study Hamiltonians which have Kitaev's toric code as a ground state, and
show how to construct a Hamiltonian which shares the ground space of the toric
code, but which has gapless excitations with a continuous spectrum in the
thermodynamic limit. Our construction is based on the framework of Projected
Entangled Pair States (PEPS), and can be applied to a large class of
two-dimensional systems to obtain gapless "uncle Hamiltonians".
