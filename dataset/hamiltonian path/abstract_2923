The Lagrangian-Hamiltonian unified formalism of R. Skinner and R. Rusk was
originally stated for autonomous dynamical systems in classical mechanics. It
has been generalized for non-autonomous first-order mechanical systems, as well
as for first-order and higher-order field theories. However, a complete
generalization to higher-order mechanical systems has yet to be described. In
this work, after reviewing the natural geometrical setting and the Lagrangian
and Hamiltonian formalisms for higher-order autonomous mechanical systems, we
develop a complete generalization of the Lagrangian-Hamiltonian unified
formalism for these kinds of systems, and we use it to analyze some physical
models from this new point of view.
