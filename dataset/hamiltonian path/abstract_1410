A number of many-body problems can be formulated using Hamiltonians that are
quadratic in the creation and annihilation operators. Here, we show how such
quadratic Hamiltonians can be efficiently estimated indirectly, employing very
few resources. We find that almost all properties of the Hamiltonian are
determined by its surface, and that these properties can be measured even if
the system can only be initialised to a mixed state. Therefore our method can
be applied to various physical models, with important examples including
coupled nano-mechanical oscillators, hopping fermions in optical lattices, and
transverse Ising chains.
