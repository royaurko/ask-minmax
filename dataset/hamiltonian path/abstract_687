Let (M,w) be a compact symplectic 2n-manifold, and g a Riemannian metric on M
compatible with w. For instance, g could be Kahler, with Kahler form w.
Consider compact Lagrangian submanifolds L of M. We call L Hamiltonian
stationary, or H-minimal, if it is a critical point of the volume functional
under Hamiltonian deformations. It is called Hamiltonian stable if in addition
the second variation of volume under Hamiltonian deformations is nonnegative.
  Our main result is that if L is a compact, Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian
in C^n satisfying the extra condition of being Hamiltonian rigid, then for any
M,w,g as above there exist compact Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangians L' in M
contained in a small ball about some p in M and locally modelled on tL for
small t>0, identifying M near p with C^n near 0. If L is Hamiltonian stable, we
can take L' to be Hamiltonian stable.
  Applying this to known examples L in C^n shows that there exist families of
Hamiltonian stable, Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangians diffeomorphic to T^n,
and to (S^1 x S^{n-1})/{1,-1}, and with other topologies, in every compact
symplectic 2n-manifold (M,w) with compatible metric g.
