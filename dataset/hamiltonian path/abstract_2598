This is a slightly enlarged and corrected version of a contribution to the
Oberwolfach Reports 3(1):511-552, 2006.
  We summarise some results on spectral properties of Laplacians on percolation
graphs and more general Anderson-percolation Hamiltonians proven in references
[4], [5], [6], and [7]. For some specific examples of such operators more
detailed spectral properties are discussed.
