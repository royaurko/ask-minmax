Empirical understanding teaches us that space is three dimensional while
relativity merges space with time. We tried to show that it is possible to
model space as three complex coordinates. In our construction, the usual
spatial coordinate are the real part while time is considered as parameter of a
path attached to each spatial point in imaginary parts. For flat spacetime,
Lorentz invariant is realized on induced metric. We first consider the space as
a six dimensional real manifold corresponding to the three complex coordinates.
The complex structure is then implemented in a reference frame dependent
manner. With this complex structure, Lorentz transformation induces a
holomorphic transformation in the complex manifold so that spatial coordinate
remained to be viewed as real axis. Scalar field in complex space could induce
a field that satisfying Klein-Gordon equation on spacetime. Finally we
described possible construction of gravity by using equivalence principle.
Assuming the coordinate transformation to an accelerating observer also induces
a holomorphic transformation, we outlined how to recover general relativity in
Hamiltonian formalism.
