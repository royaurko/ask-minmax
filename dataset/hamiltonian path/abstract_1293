By applying adiabatic theorem to a Markovian system, we calculate the
adiabatic and diabatic entropy changes along a path. As well known, the total
path entropy change is separated into two parts, system and environment entropy
changes, $\Delta S_{tot} = \Delta S_{sys} + \Delta S_{env}$. The environment
entropy change, $\Delta S_{env}$, is divided again into two parts, an adiabatic
contribution due to work, $\Delta S_{\mathcal{W}}$, and a diabatic
contributions due to heat, $\Delta S_{\mathcal{Q}}$. In an adiabatic process,
total path entropy change is same with the adiabatic path entropy change,
$\Delta S_{A}$, which is given by sum of system entropy change and adiabatic
contribution, $\Delta S_{A} = \Delta S_{sys} + \Delta S_{\mathcal{W}}$.
Mathematical form of $\Delta S_{A}$ is a type of excess heat entropy change,
but $\Delta S_{A}$ is due to work. By which, it is shown that the terms
adiabatic and non-adiabatic contributions of $\Delta S_{na}$ and $\Delta S_{a}$
in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 104}, 090601 (2010)] should be completely switched,
$i.e.$ $\Delta S_{na} \rightarrow \Delta S_{A}$ and $\Delta S_{a} \rightarrow
\Delta S_{\mathcal{Q}}$ in fact.
