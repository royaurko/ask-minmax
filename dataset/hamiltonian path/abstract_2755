A model which combines the perturbative behavior of QCD with low energy
phenomenology in a unified framework is developed. This is achieved by applying
a similarity transformation to the QCD Hamiltonian which removes interactions
between the ultraviolet cutoff and an arbitrary lower scale. Iteration then
yields a renormalization group improved effective Hamiltonian at the hadronic
energy scale. The procedure preserves the standard ultraviolet behavior of QCD.
Furthermore, the Hamiltonian evolves smoothly to a phenomenological low energy
behavior below the hadronic scale. This method has the benefit of allowing
radiative corrections to be directly incorporated into nonperturbative
many-body techniques. It is applied to Coulomb gauge QCD supplemented with a
low energy linear confinement interaction. A nontrivial vacuum is included in
the analysis via a Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation. Finally, the formalism is
applied to the vacuum gap equation, the quark condensate, and the dynamical
quark mass.
