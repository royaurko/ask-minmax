The present paper reviews recent achievements on the ab initio determination
of effective model Hamiltonians aimed at the description of strongly correlated
materials. These models (Heisenberg, $t-J$, extended Hubbard, Kondo, etc) are
crucial to solid state physicists for the description and understanding of the
electronic remarkable properties such as magnetic orders, photo-induced
magnetism, transport properties, high $t\_c$ super conductivity, etc. We will
see how the association and the control of embedding techniques, fragment
spectroscopy, effective or intermediate Hamiltonian theories, provides a
systematic and well controlled method for the determination of trustworthy
models Hamiltonians.
