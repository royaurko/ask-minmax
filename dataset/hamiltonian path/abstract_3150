It is shown how to obtain accurate values for American options using Monte
Carlo simulation. The main feature of the novel algorithm consists of tracking
the boundary between exercise and hold regions via optimization of a certain
payoff function. We compare estimates from simulation for some types of claims
with results from binomial tree calculations and find very good agreement. The
novel method allows to calculate so far untractable path-dependent option
values.
