The problem of motion for different test particles, charged and spinning
objects of constant spinning tensor in different versions of bimetric theory of
gravity is obtained by deriving their corresponding path and path deviation
equations, using a modified Bazanski in presence of Riemannian geometry. This
method enables us to find path and path deviation equations of different
objects orbiting very strong gravitational fields.
