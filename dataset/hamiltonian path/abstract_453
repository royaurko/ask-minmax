The spatiotemporal propagation of a momentum excitation on the finite
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattices is investigated. The competition between the solitary
wave and phonons gives rise to interesting propagation behaviors. For a
moderate nonlinearity, the initially excited pulse may propagate coherently
along the lattice for a long time in a solitary wave manner accompanied by
phonon tails. The lifetime of the long-transient propagation state exhibits a
sensitivity to the nonlinear parameter. The solitary wave decays exponentially
during the final loss of stability, and the decay rate varying with the
nonlinear parameter exhibits two different scaling laws. This decay is found to
be related to the largest Lyapunov exponent of the corresponding Hamiltonian
system, which manifests a transition from weak to strong chaos. The
mean-free-path of the solitary waves is estimated in the strong chaos regime,
which may be helpful to understand the origin of anomalous conductivity in the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice.
