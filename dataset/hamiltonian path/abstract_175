We study systematically finite BRST-BFV transformations in $Sp(2)$-extended
generalized Hamiltonian formalism. We present explicitly their Jacobians and
the form of a solution to the compensation equation determining the functional
field dependence of finite Fermionic parameters, necessary to generate
arbitrary finite change of gauge-fixing functions in the path integral.
