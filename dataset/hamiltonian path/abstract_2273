Using Legendrian immersions and, in particular, Legendre curves in odd
dimensional spheres and anti De Sitter spaces, we provide a method of
construction of new examples of Hamiltonian-minimal Lagrangian submanifolds in
complex projective and hyperbolic spaces, including explicit one parameter
families of embeddings of quotients of certain product manifolds. In addition,
new examples of minimal Lagrangian submanifolds in complex projective and
hyperbolic spaces also appear. Making use of all of them, we get
Hamiltonian-minimal and special Lagrangian cones in complex Euclidean space
too.
