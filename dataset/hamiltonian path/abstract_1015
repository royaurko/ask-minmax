An exact boson mapping of the reduced BCS (equal strength) pairing
Hamiltonian is considered. In the mapping, fermion pair operators are mapped
exactly to the corresponding bosons. The image of the mapping results in a
Bose-Hubbard model with level dependent hopping. Though the resultant
Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian, all eigenvalues are real when Uk/t<
1, where k is the total number of bosons. When U/t=1, a part of spectrum of the
Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian corresponds exactly to the whole spectrum of the
reduced BCS pairing Hamiltonian.
