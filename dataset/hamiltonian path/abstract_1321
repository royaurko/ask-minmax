We derive a local-time path-integral representation for a generic
one-dimensional time-independent system. In particular, we show how to rephrase
the matrix elements of the Bloch density matrix as a path integral over
x-dependent local-time profiles. The latter quantify the time that the sample
paths x(t) in the Feynman path integral spend in the vicinity of an arbitrary
point x. Generalization of the local-time representation that includes
arbitrary functionals of the local time is also provided. We argue that the
results obtained represent a powerful alternative to the traditional
Feynman-Kac formula, particularly in the high and low temperature regimes. To
illustrate this point, we apply our local-time representation to analyze the
asymptotic behavior of the Bloch density matrix at low temperatures. Further
salient issues, such as connections with the Sturm-Liouville theory and the
Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle are also discussed.
