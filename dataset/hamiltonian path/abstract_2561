In this paper we compute the Reidemeister torsion of a isoenergetic surface
for the integrable Hamiltonian system on the four-dimensional symplectic
manifold. We use the spectral sequence defined by the filtration and following
Witten-Floer ideas we bring into play the orbits connecting the critical
submanifolds.
