We address the question of ambiguity in defining a Hamiltonian for a scalar
field. We point out that the Hamiltonian for a real Klein-Gordon scalar field
must be consistent with the energy density obtained from the Schrodinger
equation in the non-relativistic regime. To achieve this we had to add some
surface terms (total divergencies) to the standard Hamiltonian, which in
general will not change the equations of motion, but will redefine energy. As
an additional requirement, a Hamiltonian must be able to reproduce the
equations of motion directly from Hamilton's equations defined by the principle
of the least action. We find that the standard Hamiltonian does not always do
so and that the proposed Hamiltonian provides a good non-relativistic limit.
This is a hint that something as simple as the Hamiltonian of the real
Klein-Gordon scalar field has to be treated carefully. We had illustrated our
discussion with an explicit example of the kink solution.
