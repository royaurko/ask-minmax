The Lie group adiabatic evolution determined by a Lie algebra parameter
dependent Hamiltonian is considered. It is demonstrated that in the case when
the parameter space of the Hamiltonian is a homogeneous K\"ahler manifold its
fundamental K\"ahler potentials completely determine Berry geometrical phase
factor. Explicit expressions for Berry vector potentials (Berry connections)
and Berry curvatures are obtained using the complex parametrization of the
Hamiltonian parameter space. A general approach is exemplified by the Lie
algebra Hamiltonians corresponding to SU(2) and SU(3) evolution groups.
