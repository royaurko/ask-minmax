Denote by $x$ a random infinite path in the graph of Pascal's triangle (left
and right turns are selected independently with fixed probabilities) and by
$d_n(x)$ the binomial coefficient at the $n$'th level along the path $x$. Then
for a dense $G_{\delta}$ set of $\theta$ in the unit interval, $\{d_n(x)\theta
\}$ is almost surely dense but not uniformly distributed modulo 1.
