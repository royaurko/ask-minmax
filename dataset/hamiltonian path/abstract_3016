The concept of exchange length is used to determine the effects of boundary
scattering on transport in samples of circular and rectangular cross section.
Analytical expressions are presented for an effective mean-free path for
transport in the axial direction. The relationship to the phonon thermal
conductivity is discussed. (This letter outlines the results presented in
detail in the longer version, available as cond-mat/9402081)
