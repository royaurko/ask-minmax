For a principal bundle $P\to M$ equipped with a connection ${\bar A}$, we
study an infinite dimensional bundle ${\mathcal P}^{\rm dec}_{\bar A}P$ over
the space of paths on $M$, with the points of ${\mathcal P}^{\rm dec}_{\bar
A}P$ being horizontal paths on $P$ decorated with elements of a second
structure group. We construct parallel transport processes on such bundles and
study holonomy bundles in this setting. We explain the relationship with
categorical geometry and explore the notion of categorical connections on
categorical principal bundles in a concrete differential geometric way.
