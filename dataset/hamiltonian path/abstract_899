A circular Pascal array is a periodization of the familiar Pascal's triangle.
Using simple operators defined on periodic sequences, we find a direct
relationship between the ranges of the circular Pascal arrays and numbers of
certain lattice paths within corridors, which are related to Dyck paths. This
link provides new, short proofs of some nontrivial formulas found in the
lattice-path literature.
