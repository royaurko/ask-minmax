We describe a renormalization group transformation that is related to the
breakup of golden invariant tori in Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of
freedom. This transformation applies to a large class of Hamiltonians, is
conceptually simple, and allows for accurate numerical computations. In a
numerical implementation, we find a nontrivial fixed point and determine the
corresponding critical index and scaling. Our computed values for various
universal constants are in good agreement with existing data for
area-preserving maps. We also discuss the flow associated with the nontrivial
fixed point.
