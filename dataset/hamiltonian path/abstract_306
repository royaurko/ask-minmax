The width of a Lagrangian is the largest capacity of a ball that can be
symplectically embedded into the ambient manifold such that the ball intersects
the Lagrangian exactly along the real part of the ball. Due to Dimitroglou
Rizell, finite width is an obstruction to a Lagrangian admitting an exact
Lagrangian cap in the sense of Eliashberg-Murphy. In this paper we introduce a
new method for bounding the width of a Lagrangian Q by considering the
Lagrangian Floer cohomology of an auxiliary Lagrangian L with respect to a
Hamiltonian whose chords correspond to geodesic paths in Q. This is formalized
as a wrapped version of the Floer-Hofer-Wysocki capacity and we establish an
associated energy-capacity inequality with the help of a closed-open map. For
any orientable Lagrangian Q admitting a metric of non-positive sectional
curvature in a Liouville manifold, we show the width of Q is bounded above by
four times its displacement energy.
