In this paper we introduce a method for finding a time independent
Hamiltonian of a given dynamical system by canonoid transformation. We also
find a condition that the system should satisfy to have an equivalent time
independent formulation. We study the example of damped oscillator and give the
new time independent Hamiltonian for it, which has the property of tending to
the standard Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator as damping goes to zero.
