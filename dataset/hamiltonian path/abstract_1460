The eigenstates of many-body localized (MBL) Hamiltonians exhibit low
entanglement. We adapt the highly successful density-matrix renormalization
group method, which is usually used to find modestly entangled ground states of
local Hamiltonians, to find individual highly excited eigenstates of many body
localized Hamiltonians. The adaptation builds on the distinctive spatial
structure of such eigenstates. We benchmark our method against the well studied
random field Heisenberg model in one dimension. At moderate to large disorder,
we find that the method successfully obtains excited eigenstates with high
accuracy, thereby enabling a study of MBL systems at much larger system sizes
than those accessible to exact-diagonalization methods.
