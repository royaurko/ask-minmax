We use Boulware's Hamiltonian formalism of quadratic gravity theories in
order to analyze the classical behaviour of Bianchi cosmological models for a
Lagrangian density containing quadratic terms in the curvature. For this
purpose we define a canonical transformation which leads to a clear distinction
between two main variants of the quadratic theory, namely the R-squared or
conformal Lagrangian densities. In this paper we restrict the study to the
first variant. For Bianchi type I and IX models we give the explicit forms of
the super-Hamiltonian constraint, of the ADM Hamiltonian density and of the
corresponding canonical equations. In the case of a pure R-squared theory we
solve these equations analytically for Bianchi I model. For Bianchi type IX
model, we reduce the first-order equations of the Hamiltonian system to three
coupled second-order equations for the true physical degrees of freedom. This
discussion is extended to isotropic FLRW models.
