We describe a procedure for mapping a self-consistent mean-field theory (also
known as density functional theory) into a shell model Hamiltonian that
includes quadrupole-quadrupole and monopole pairing interactions in a truncated
space. We test our method in the deformed N=Z sd-shell nuclei Ne-20, Mg-24 and
Ar-36, starting from the Hartree-Fock plus BCS approximation of the USD shell
model interaction. A similar procedure is then followed using the SLy4 Skyrme
energy density functional in the particle-hole channel plus a zero-range
density-dependent force in the pairing channel. Using the ground-state solution
of this density functional theory at the Hartree-Fock plus BCS level, an
effective shell model Hamiltonian is constructed. We use this mapped
Hamiltonian to extract quadrupolar and pairing correlation energies beyond the
mean field approximation. The rescaling of the mass quadrupole operator in the
truncated shell model space is found to be almost independent of the coupling
strength used in the pairing channel of the underlying mean-field theory.
