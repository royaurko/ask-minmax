In this paper we develop a fractional Hamiltonian formulation for dynamic
systems defined in terms of fractional Caputo derivatives. Expressions for
fractional canonical momenta and fractional canonical Hamiltonian are given,
and a set of fractional Hamiltonian equations are obtained. Using an example,
it is shown that the canonical fractional Hamiltonian and the fractional
Euler-Lagrange formulations lead to the same set of equations.
