Reciprocal transformations of Hamiltonian operators of hydrodynamic type are
investigated. The transformed operators are generally nonlocal, possessing a
number of remarkable algebraic and differential-geometric properties. We apply
our results to linearly degenerate semi-Hamiltonian systems in Riemann
invariants. Since all such systems are linearizable by appropriate
(generalized) reciprocal transformations, our formulae provide an infinity of
mutually compatible nonlocal Hamiltonian structures, explicitly parametrized by
arbitrary functions of one variable.
