The leading and next to leading terms of the average arithmetic area $<
S(m)>$ enclosed by $m\to\infty$ independent closed Brownian planar paths, with
a given length $t$ and starting from and ending at the same point, is
calculated. The leading term is found to be $< S(m) > \sim {\pi t\over 2}\ln m$
and the $0$-winding sector arithmetic area inside the $m$ paths is subleading
in the asymptotic regime. A closed form expression for the algebraic area
distribution is also obtained and discussed.
