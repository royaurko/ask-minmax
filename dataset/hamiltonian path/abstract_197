We present a numerical method for computing optimal transition pathways and
transition rates in systems of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In
particular, we compute the most probable transition path of stochastic
equations by minimizing the effective action in a corresponding deterministic
Hamiltonian system. The numerical method presented here involves using an
iterative scheme for solving a two-point boundary value problem for the
Hamiltonian system. We validate our method by applying it to both continuous
stochastic systems, such as nonlinear oscillators governed by the Duffing
equation, and finite discrete systems, such as epidemic problems, which are
governed by a set of master equations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this
method is capable of dealing with stochastic systems of delay differential
equations.
