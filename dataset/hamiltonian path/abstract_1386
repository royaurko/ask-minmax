We derive an effective low-dimensional Hamiltonian for strongly interacting
ultracold atoms in a transverse trapping potential near a wide Feshbach
resonance. The Hamiltonian includes crucial information about transverse
excitations in an effective model with renormalized interaction between atoms
and composite dressed molecules. We fix all the parameters in the Hamiltonian
for both one- and two-dimensional cases.
