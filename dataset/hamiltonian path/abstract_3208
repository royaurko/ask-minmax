The trajectories of light are demostrated with experiments made with a
microwave oscilator coupled to a horn antenna and a movable metalic plate along
the radar beam. Two polarizations were made: Linear polarization that produced
double cycloids paths and circular polarization that produced helical paths.
Both trajectories filled the empty space around the trajectories. The new
photon model which is formed by two particles instead of the traditional one,
equations and physical behavior is totally filled.
