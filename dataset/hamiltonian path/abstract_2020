In this paper we present a novel termination order the {\em predicative
lexicographic path order} (PLPO for short), a syntactic restriction of the
lexicographic path order. As well as lexicographic path orders, several
non-trivial primitive recursive equations, e.g., primitive recursion with
parameter substitution, unnested multiple recursion, or simple nested
recursion, can be oriented with PLPOs. It can be shown that the PLPO however
only induces primitive recursive upper bounds on derivation lengths of
compatible rewrite systems. This yields an alternative proof of a classical
fact that the class of primitive recursive functions is closed under those
non-trivial primitive recursive equations.
