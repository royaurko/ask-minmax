We give some interpretations to certain integer sequences in terms of
parameters on Grand-Dyck paths and coloured noncrossing partitions, and we find
some new bijections relating Grand-Dyck paths and signed pattern avoiding
permutations. Next we transfer a natural distributive lattice structure on
Grand-Dyck paths to coloured noncrossing partitions and signed pattern avoiding
permutations, thus showing, in particular, that it is isomorphic to the
structure induced by the (strong) Bruhat order on a certain set of signed
pattern avoiding permutations.
