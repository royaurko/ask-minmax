We investigate path integral quantization of two versions of unimodular
gravity. First a fully diffeomorphism-invariant theory is analyzed, which does
not include a unimodular condition on the metric, while still being equivalent
to other unimodular gravity theories at classical level. The path integral has
the same form as in general relativity (GR), except that the cosmological
constant is an unspecified value of a variable, and thus unrelated to any
coupling constant. When the state of the universe is a superposition of vacuum
states, the path integral is extended to include an integral over the
cosmological constant.
  Second, we analyze the standard unimodular theory of gravity, where the
metric determinant is fixed by a constraint. Its path integral differs from the
one of GR in two ways: the metric of spacetime satisfies the unimodular
condition only in average over space, and both the Hamiltonian constraint and
the associated gauge condition have zero average over space. Finally, the
canonical relation between the given unimodular theories of gravity is
established.
