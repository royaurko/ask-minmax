We propose a formalism for extracting molecular Hamiltonian structure from
inversion of time-dependent fluorescence intensity data. The proposed method
requires a minimum of \emph{a priori} knowledge about the system and allows for
extracting a complete set of information about the Hamiltonian for a pair of
molecular electronic surfaces.
