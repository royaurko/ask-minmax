We consider the use of interpolating gauges (with a gauge function (F[A;alpha
]) in gauge theories to connect the results in a set of different gauges in the
path-integral formulation. We point out that the results for physical
observables are very sensitive to the epsilon term that we have to add to deal
with singularities and thus cannot be left out of a discussion of
gauge-independence generally. We further point out, with reasons, that the fact
that we can ignore this term in the discussion of gauge independence while
varying of the gauge parameter in Lorentz-type covariant gauges is an exception
rather than a rule . We show that generally gauge-independence requires that
the epsilon-term has to be varied with alpha. We further show that if we make a
naive use of the epsilon term -i\int d^{4}x[{1/2}A^{2}-\bar{c}c]) (that is
appropriate for the Feynman gauge) for general interpolating gauges with
arbitrary parameter values [i.e.alpha], we cannot preserve gauge independence
[except when we happen to be in the infinitesimal neighborhood of the
Lorentz-type gauges]. We show with an explicit example that for such a naive
use of an epsilon-term, we develop serious pathology in the path-integral as
alpha is/are varied. We point out that correct way to fix the epsilon-term in a
path-integral in a non-Lorentz gauge is by connecting the path-integral to the
Lorentz-gauge path-integral with correct epsilon-term as has been done using
the finite field-dependent BRS transformations in recent years.
