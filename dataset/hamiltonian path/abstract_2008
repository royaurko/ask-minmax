In this paper, we present a joint Doppler frequency shift compensation and
data detection method using 2-D unitary ESPRIT algorithm for SIMO-OFDM railway
communication systems over fast time-varying sparse multipath channels. By
creating the spatio-temporal array data matrix utilizing the ISI-free part of
the CP (cyclic prefix), we first propose a novel algorithm for obtaining
auto-paired joint DOA and Doppler frequency shift estimates of all paths via
2-D unitary ESPRIT algorithm. Thereafter, based on the obtained estimates, a
joint Doppler frequency shift compensation and data detection method is
developed. This method consists of three parts: (a) the received signal is
spatially filtered to get the signal corresponding to each path, and the signal
corresponding to each path is compensated for the Doppler frequency shift in
time domain, (b) the Doppler frequency shift-compensated signals of all paths
are summed together, and (c) the desired information is detected by performing
FFT on the summed signal after excluding the CP. Moreover, we prove that the
channel matrix becomes time-invariant after Doppler frequency shift
compensation and the ICI is effectively avoided. Finally, simulation results
are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and compare
it with the conventional method.
