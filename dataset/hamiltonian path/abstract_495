The reparametrization-invariant generating functional for the unitary and
causal perturbation theory in general relativity in a finite space-time is
obtained. The region of validity of the Faddeev-Popov-DeWitt functional is
studied. It is shown that the invariant content of general relativity as a
constrained system can be covered by two "equivalent" unconstrained systems:
the "dynamic" (with "dynamic" evolution parameter as the metric scale factor)
and "geometric" (given by the Levi-Civita type canonical transformation to the
action-angle variables where the energy constraint converts into a new
momentum). "Big Bang", the Hubble evolution, and creation of matter fields by
the "geometric" vacuum are described by the inverted Levi-Civita (LC)
transformation of the geomeric system into the dynamic one. The particular case
of the LC transformations are the Bogoliubov ones of the particle variables
(diagonalizing the dynamic Hamiltonian) to the quasiparticles (diagonalizing
the equations of motion). The choice of initial conditions for the "Big Bang"
in the form of the Bogoliubov (squeezed) vacuum reproduces all stages of the
evolution of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe in their conformal
(Hoyle-Narlikar) versions.
