The multimomentum Hamiltonian formalism is applied to field systems
represented by sections of composite manifolds $Y\to\Si\to X$ where sections of
$\Si\to X$ are parameter fields, e.g., Higgs fields and gravitational fields.
Their values play the role of coordinate parameters, besides the world
coordinates.
