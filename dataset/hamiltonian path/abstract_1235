Path length changes through the atmosphere cause significant errors for
astronomical radio interferometry at high frequencies (e.g. 100 GHz). Path
length differences typically give rise to a differential excess path of 1mm for
antennas separated by 1km, and have fluctuation time scales of greater than 10
seconds. To measure these fluctuations, we are building a four-channel
radiometer centred on the 22 GHz water line. By sensing the water vapour
emission, the excess path can be deduced and corrected. Multiple channels give
us robustness against various systematic errors, but gain stability of the
radiometer of 1 pair in 10^4 is still required.
