This is an attempt to address diffusion phenomena from the point of view of
information theory. We imagine a regular hamiltonian system under the random
perturbation of thermal (molecular) noise and chaotic instability. The
irregularity of the random process produced in this way is taken into account
via the dynamic uncertainty measured by a path information associated with
different transition paths between two points in phase space. According to the
result of our previous work, this dynamic system maximizes this uncertainty in
order to follow the action principle of mechanics. In this work, this
methodology is applied to particle diffusion in external potential field. By
using the exponential probability distribution of action (least action
distribution) yielded by maximum path information, a derivation of
Fokker-Planck equation, Fick's laws and Ohm's law for normal diffusion is given
without additional assumptions about the nature of the process. This result
suggests that, for irregular dynamics, the method of maximum path information,
instead of the least action principle for regular dynamics, should be used in
order to obtain the correct occurring probability of different paths of
transport. Nevertheless, the action principle is present in this formalism of
stochastic mechanics because the average action has a stationary associated
with the dynamic uncertainty. The limits of validity of this work is discussed.
