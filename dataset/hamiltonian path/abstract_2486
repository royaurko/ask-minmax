In this paper, a systematic approach of constructing modified equations for
weak stochastic symplectic methods of stochastic Hamiltonian systems is given
via using the generating functions of the stochastic symplectic methods. This
approach is valid for stochastic Hamiltonian systems with either additive
noises or half-multiplicative noises, and we prove that the modified equation
of the weak stochastic symplectic methods are perturbed stochastic Hamiltonian
systems of the original systems, which reveals in certain sense the reason for
the good long time numerical behavior of stochastic symplectic methods.
