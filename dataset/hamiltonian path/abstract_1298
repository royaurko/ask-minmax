This technical report is an extended version of the paper 'A Receding Horizon
Algorithm for Informative Path Planning with Temporal Logic Constraints'
accepted to the 2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
(ICRA). This paper considers the problem of finding the most informative path
for a sensing robot under temporal logic constraints, a richer set of
constraints than have previously been considered in information gathering. An
algorithm for informative path planning is presented that leverages tools from
information theory and formal control synthesis, and is proven to give a path
that satisfies the given temporal logic constraints. The algorithm uses a
receding horizon approach in order to provide a reactive, on-line solution
while mitigating computational complexity. Statistics compiled from multiple
simulation studies indicate that this algorithm performs better than a baseline
exhaustive search approach.
