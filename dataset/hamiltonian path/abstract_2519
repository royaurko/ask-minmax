We perform an unitary transformation for the symmetric phonon mode of the
Holstein molecular crystal hamiltonian. We show how to compute the electronic
spectral functions by exact numerical diagonalisation of an effective
hamiltonian fully taking account of the symmetric phonon mode, usually
discarded.
