We introduce the notion of Hamiltonian spaces for Manin pairs over manifolds,
using the so-called generalized Dirac structures. As an example, we describe
Hamiltonian spaces of a quasi-Lie bialgebroid using this general framework. We
also discuss reduction of Hamiltonian spaces of this general type.
