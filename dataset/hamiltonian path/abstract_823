A hole has been found in the algorithm as given, where an eleventh hour
change admits a path inconsistency. The inconsistency arises due to an improper
closure of a path to a cycle against a root not supportive of the path. The
mathematical basis of the algorithm remains supportive of the intended
solution, and a revision of the algorithm is underway.
