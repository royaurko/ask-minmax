A path separator of a graph $G$ is a set of paths
$\mathcal{P}=\{P_1,\ldots,P_t\}$ such that for every pair of edges $e,f\in
E(G)$, there exist paths $P_e,P_f\in\mathcal{P}$ such that $e\in E(P_e)$,
$f\not\in E(P_e)$, $e\not\in E(P_f)$ and $f\in E(P_f)$. The path separation
number of $G$, denoted ${\rm psn}(G)$, is the smallest number of paths in a
path separator. We shall estimate the path separation number of several graph
families, including complete graphs, random graph, the hypercube, and discuss
general graphs as well.
