A theory of integration for anticommuting paths is described. This is
combined with standard It\^o calculus to give a geometric theory of Brownian
paths on curved supermanifolds. (Invited lecture given at meeting on `Espaces
de Lacets', Institut de Recherche Math\'ematique Advanc\'ee, Universit\'e Louis
Pasteur, Strasbourg, June 1994.)
