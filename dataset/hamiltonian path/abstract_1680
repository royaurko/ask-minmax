This note is devoted to construct a rough path above a multidimensional
fractional Brownian motion $B$ with any Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$, by means
of its representation as a Volterra Gaussian process. This approach yields some
algebraic and computational simplifications with respect to [Stochastic
Process. Appl. 120 (2010) 1444--1472], where the construction of a rough path
over $B$ was first introduced.
