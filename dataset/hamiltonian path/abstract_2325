We examine in detail the possibilty of applying Darboux transformation to non
Hermitian hamiltonians. In particular we propose a simple method of
constructing exactly solvable PT symmetric potentials by applying Darboux
transformation to higher states of an exactly solvable PT symmetric potential.
It is shown that the resulting hamiltonian and the original one are pseudo
supersymmetric partners. We also discuss application of Darboux transformation
to hamiltonians with spontaneously broken PT symmetry.
