In this paper, the method of approximate transformation groups which was
proposed by Baikov, Gazizov and Ibragimov, is extended on Hamiltonian and
bi-Hamiltonian systems of evolution equations. Indeed, as a main consequence,
this extended procedure is applied in order to compute the approximate
conservation laws and approximate recursion operators corresponding to these
types of equations. In particular, as an application, a comprehensive analysis
of the problem of approximate conservation laws and approximate recursion
operators associated to the Gardner equation with the small parameters is
presented.
