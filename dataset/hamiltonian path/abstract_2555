We consider models involving the higher (third) derivative extension of the
abelian Chern-Simons (CS) topological term in D=2+1 dimensions. The
polarisation vectors in these models reveal an identical structure with the
corresponding expressions for usual models which contain, at most, quadratic
structures. We also investigate the Hamiltonian structure of these models and
show how Wigner's little group acts as gauge generator.
