A recently developed analytical method for systematic improvement of the
convergence of path integrals is used to derive a generalization of Euler's
summation formula for path integrals. The first $p$ terms in this formula
improve convergence of path integrals to the continuum limit from 1/N to
$1/N^p$, where $N$ is the coarseness of the discretization. Monte Carlo
simulations performed on several different models show that the analytically
derived speedup holds.
