It is argued that in the limit of extreme disorder AC hopping is dominated by
"percolation paths". Modelling a percolation path as a one-dimensional path
with a sharp jump rate cut-off leads to an expression for the universal AC
conductivity, that fits computer simulations in two and three dimensions better
than the effective medium approximation.
