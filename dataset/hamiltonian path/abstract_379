The polaron has been of interest in condensed matter theory and field theory
for about half a century, especially the limit of large coupling constant. It
was not until 1983, however, that a proof of the asymptotic formula for the
ground state energy was finally given by using difficult arguments involving
the large deviation theory of path integrals. Here we derive the same
asymptotic result and with explicit error bounds, by simple, rigorous methods
applied directly to the Hamiltonian. Our method is easily generalizable to
other settings, e.g., the excitonic and magnetic polarons. This version of the
article includes an erratum concerning the ultra-violet bound given in the
published article. The erratum is to appear in the same journal.
