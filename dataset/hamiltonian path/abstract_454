The state price density of a basket, even under uncorrelated Black-Scholes
dynamics, does not allow for a closed from density. (This may be rephrased as
statement on the sum of lognormals and is especially annoying for such are used
most frequently in Financial and Actuarial Mathematics.) In this note we
discuss short time and small volatility expansions, respectively. The method
works for general multi-factor models with correlations and leads to the
analysis of a system of ordinary (Hamiltonian) differential equations.
Surprisingly perhaps, even in two asset Black-Scholes situation (with its flat
geometry), the expansion can degenerate at a critical (basket) strike level; a
phenomena which seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature to date.
Explicit computations relate this to a phase transition from a unique to more
than one "most-likely" paths (along which the diffusion, if suitably
conditioned, concentrates in the afore-mentioned regimes). This also provides a
(quantifiable) understanding of how precisely a presently out-of-money basket
option may still end up in-the-money.
