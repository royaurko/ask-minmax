The classical Hamilton equations of motion yield a structure sufficiently
general to handle an almost arbitrary set of ordinary differential equations.
Employing elementary algebraic methods, it is possible within the Hamiltonian
structure to describe many physical systems exhibiting Lie group symmetries.
Elementary examples include magnetic moment precession and the mechanical
orbits of color charged particles in classical non-abelian chromodynamics.
