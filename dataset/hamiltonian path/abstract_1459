We perform the full Hamiltonian analysis of the topological BFCG action based
on the Poincare 2-group. The Hamiltonian of the theory is constructed, and the
algebra of constraints is computed. The Dirac brackets are evaluated, and the
second class constraints are then eliminated from the theory. The results are
contrasted to those of the topological Poincare gauge theory, which is
equivalent to the BFCG model at the level of the classical action, but has a
very different Hamiltonian structure.
