We show that high-temperature expansions may serve as a basis for the novel
approach to efficient Monte Carlo simulations. "Worm" algorithms utilize the
idea of updating closed path configurations (produced by high-temperature
expansions) through the motion of end points of a disconnected path. An amazing
result is that local, Metropolis-type schemes may have dynamical critical
exponents close to zero (i.e., their efficiency is comparable to the best
cluster methods). We demonstrate this by calculating finite size scaling of the
autocorrelation time for various (six) universality classes.
