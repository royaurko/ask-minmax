We introduce a notion of rough paths on embedded submanifolds and demonstrate
that this class of rough paths is natural. On the way we develop a notion of
rough integration and an efficient and intrinsic theory of rough differential
equations (RDEs) on manifolds. The theory of RDEs is then used to construct
parallel translation along manifold valued rough paths. Finally, this framework
is used to show there is a one to one correspondence between rough paths on a
d-dimensional manifold and rough paths on d-dimensional Euclidean space. This
last result is a rough path analogue of Cartan's development map and its
stochastic version which was developed by Eeels and Elworthy and Malliavin.
