A Hamiltonian approach to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equations has
been developed. Based on a nonlinear canonical transformation, the rapidly
oscillating terms in the original Hamiltonian are transformed away, yielding a
new Hamiltonian that contains slowly varying terms only. The formalism has been
applied to the dynamics of an intense beam propagating through a periodic
focusing lattice, and to the coherent beam-beam interaction. A stationary
solution to the transformed Vlasov equation has been obtained.
