The known bijections on Dyck paths are either involutions or have notoriously
intractable cycle structure. Here we present a size-preserving bijection on
Dyck paths whose cycle structure is amenable to complete analysis. In
particular, each cycle has length a power of 2. A new manifestation of the
Catalan numbers as labeled forests crops up enroute as does the Pascal matrix
mod 2. We use the bijection to show the equivalence of two known manifestations
of the Motzkin numbers. Finally, we consider some statistics on the new Catalan
manifestation.
