We construct an approximate renormalization transformation that combines
Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM)and renormalization-group techniques, to analyze
instabilities in Hamiltonian systems with three degrees of freedom. This scheme
is implemented both for isoenergetically nondegenerate and for degenerate
Hamiltonians. For the spiral mean frequency vector, we find numerically that
the iterations of the transformation on nondegenerate Hamiltonians tend to
degenerate ones on the critical surface. As a consequence, isoenergetically
degenerate and nondegenerate Hamiltonians belong to the same universality
class, and thus the corresponding critical invariant tori have the same type of
scaling properties. We numerically investigate the structure of the attracting
set on the critical surface and find that it is a strange nonchaotic attractor.
We compute exponents that characterize its universality class.
