Let $c$ be an edge-colouring of a graph $G$ such that for every vertex $v$
there are at least $d \ge 2$ different colours on edges incident to $v$. We
prove that $G$ contains a properly coloured path of length 2d or a properly
coloured cycle of length at least $d+1$. Moreover, if $G$ does not contain any
properly coloured cycle, then there exists a properly coloured path of length
$3 \times 2^{d-1}-2$.
