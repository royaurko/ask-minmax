The Hamiltonian for physical systems and dynamic geometry generates the
evolution of a spatial region along a vector field. It includes a boundary term
which not only determines the value of the Hamiltonian, but also, via the
boundary term in the variation of the Hamiltonian, the boundary conditions. The
value of the Hamiltonian comes from its boundary term; it gives the quasi-local
quantities: energy-momentum and angular-momentum/center-of-mass. This boundary
term depends not only on the dynamical variables but also on their reference
values; these reference values determine the ground state---the state having
vanishing quasi-local quantities. Here our concern is how to select on the
two-boundary the reference values. To determine the "best matched" reference
metric and connection values for our preferred boundary term for Einstein's
general relativity, we propose on the boundary two-surface (i) \emph{four
dimensional} isometric matching, and (ii) extremizing the value of the energy.
