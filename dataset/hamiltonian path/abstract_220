In the complex action theory whose path runs over not only past but also
future we study a normalized matrix element of an operator $\hat{\cal O}$
defined in terms of the future state at the latest time $T_B$ and the past
state at the earliest time $T_A$ with a proper inner product that makes normal
a given Hamiltonian that is non-normal at first. We present a theorem that
states that, provided that the operator $\hat{\cal O}$ is $Q$-Hermitian, i.e.,
Hermitian with regard to the proper inner product, the normalized matrix
element becomes real and time-develops under a $Q$-Hermitian Hamiltonian for
the past and future states selected such that the absolute value of the
transition amplitude from the past state to the future state is maximized.
Furthermore, we give a possible procedure to formulate the $Q$-Hermitian
Hamiltonian in terms of $Q$-Hermitian coordinate and momentum operators, and
construct a conserved probability current density.
