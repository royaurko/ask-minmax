In this article we introduce a low order implicit symplectic integrator
designed to follow the Hamiltonian flow as close as possible. This integrator
is obtained by the method of Liouvillian forms proposed by the contributor in a
previous work and does not requires particular hypotheses on the Hamiltonian.
  The numerical scheme introduced in this paper is a modification of the
symplectic mid-point rule, it is symmetric and it is obtained by an isotopy of
the deformation of the exact Hamiltonian flow to the straight line passing by
two consecutive points of the discretized flow. This isotopy generates an
alternative vector field on the flow lines transversal to the Hamiltonian
vector field. We consider only the line arising from the mid-point to construct
our symplectic integrator.
