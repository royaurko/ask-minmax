The dynamical discrete web is a system of one-dimensional coalescing random
walks that evolves in an extra dynamical time parameter. At any deterministic
dynamical time, the paths behave as coalescing simple symmetric random walks.
This paper studies the existence of (random) exceptional dynamical times at
which the paths violate certain almost sure properties of random walks. It was
shown in 2009 by Fontes, Newman, Ravishankar and Schertzer that there exist
exceptional times at which the path starting from the origin violates the law
of the iterated logarithm. Their results gave exceptional times at which the
path is slightly subdiffusive in one direction. This paper extends this to
obtain times at which the path is slightly superdiffusive in one direction and
times at which the path is slightly subdiffusive in both directions. We also
obtain upper and lower bounds for the Hausdorff dimensions of the sets of
two-sided subdiffusive exceptional times, and a lower bound for the Hausdorff
dimension of set of superdiffusive exceptional times.
