We discuss BFV deformation quantization of singular symplectic quotient
spaces in the special case of linear Hamiltonian torus actions. In particular,
we show that the Koszul complex on the moment map of an effective linear
Hamiltonian torus action is acyclic. We rephrase the nonpositivity condition of
Arms, Gotay and Jennings for linear Hamiltonian torus actions. It follows that
reduced spaces of such actions admit continuous star products.
