We discuss the path of a tracer particle as a microswimmer moves past on an
infinite straight trajectory. If the tracer is sufficiently far from the path
of the swimmer it moves in a closed loop. As the initial distance between the
tracer and the path of the swimmer $\rho$ decreases, the tracer is displaced a
small distance backwards (relative to the direction of the swimmer velocity).
For much smaller tracer-swimmer separations, however, the tracer displacement
becomes positive and diverges as $\rho \to 0$. To quantify this behaviour we
calculate the Darwin drift, the total volume swept out by a material sheet of
tracers, initially perpendicular to the swimmer path, during the swimmer
motion. We find that the drift can be written as the sum of a {\em universal}
term which depends on the quadrupolar flow field of the swimmer, together with
a non-universal contribution given by the sum of the volumes of the swimmer and
its wake. The formula is compared to exact results for the squirmer model and
to numerical calculations for a more realistic model swimmer.
