We discuss the construction of basis states for Hamiltonian QCD on the
lattice, in particular states with dynamical quark pairs. We calculate the
matrix elements of the operators in the QCD Hamiltonian between these states.
Along with the ``harmonic oscillator'' states introduced in previous pure SU(3)
work, these states form a working basis for calculations in full QCD.
