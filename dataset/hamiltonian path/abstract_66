Scalar field systems containing higher derivatives are studied and quantized
by Hamiltonian path integral formalism. A new point to previous quantization
methods is that field functions and their derivatives with time are considered
as independent canonical variables. Consequently, generating functional,
explicit expressions of propagators and Feynman diagrams in $\phi^3$ theory are
found
