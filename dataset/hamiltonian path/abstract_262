We present the first auxiliary field Monte Carlo calculations for a rare
earth nucleus, Dy-170. A pairing plus quadrupole Hamiltonian is used to
demonstrate the physical properties that can be studied in this region. We
calculate various static observables for both uncranked and cranked systems and
show how the shape distribution evolves with temperature. We also introduce a
discretization of the path integral that allows a more efficient Monte Carlo
sampling.
