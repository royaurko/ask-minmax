Let $G=(V,E)$ be an $n$-nodes non-negatively real-weighted undirected graph.
In this paper we show how to enrich a {\em single-source shortest-path tree}
(SPT) of $G$ with a \emph{sparse} set of \emph{auxiliary} edges selected from
$E$, in order to create a structure which tolerates effectively a \emph{path
failure} in the SPT. This consists of a simultaneous fault of a set $F$ of at
most $f$ adjacent edges along a shortest path emanating from the source, and it
is recognized as one of the most frequent disruption in an SPT. We show that,
for any integer parameter $k \geq 1$, it is possible to provide a very sparse
(i.e., of size $O(kn\cdot f^{1+1/k})$) auxiliary structure that carefully
approximates (i.e., within a stretch factor of $(2k-1)(2|F|+1)$) the true
shortest paths from the source during the lifetime of the failure. Moreover, we
show that our construction can be further refined to get a stretch factor of
$3$ and a size of $O(n \log n)$ for the special case $f=2$, and that it can be
converted into a very efficient \emph{approximate-distance sensitivity oracle},
that allows to quickly (even in optimal time, if $k=1$) reconstruct the
shortest paths (w.r.t. our structure) from the source after a path failure,
thus permitting to perform promptly the needed rerouting operations. Our
structure compares favorably with previous known solutions, as we discuss in
the paper, and moreover it is also very effective in practice, as we assess
through a large set of experiments.
