The path integral on a homogeneous space $ G/H $ is constructed, based on the
guiding principle `first lift to $ G $ and then project to $ G/H $'. It is then
shown that this principle admits inequivalent quantizations inducing a gauge
field (the canonical connection) on the homogeneous space, and thereby
reproduces the result obtained earlier by algebraic approaches.
