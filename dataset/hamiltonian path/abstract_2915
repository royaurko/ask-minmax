We present results for neutron star models constructed with a new equation of
state for nuclear matter at zero temperature. The ground state is computed
using the Auxiliary Field Diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC) technique, with
nucleons interacting via a semi-phenomenological Hamiltonian including a
realistic two-body interaction. The effect of many-body forces is included by
means of additional density-dependent terms in the Hamiltonian. In this letter
we compare the properties of the resulting neutron-star models with those
obtained using other nuclear Hamiltonians, focusing on the relations between
mass and radius, and between the gravitational mass and the baryon number.
