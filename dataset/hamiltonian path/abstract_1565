We derive a novel efficient scheme to measure the rate constant of
transitions between stable states separated by high free energy barriers in a
complex environment within the framework of transition path sampling. The
method is based on directly and simultaneously measuring the fluxes through
many phase space interfaces and increases the efficiency with at least a factor
of two with respect to existing transition path sampling rate constant
algorithms. The new algorithm is illustrated on the isomerization of a diatomic
molecule immersed in a simple fluid.
