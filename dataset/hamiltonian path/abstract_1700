The stable rank of Leavitt path algebras of row-finite graphs was computed by
Ara and Pardo. In this paper we extend this for an arbitrary directed graph. In
some parts, we proceed our computation as the row-finite case while in some
parts we use the knowledge about row-finite setting by applying the
desingularizing method due to Drinen and Tomforde. In particular, we
characterize purely infinite simple quotients of a Leavitt path algebra.
