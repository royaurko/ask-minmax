The Feynman path integral is used to quantize the symplectic leaves of the
Poisson-Lie group SU(2)*. In this way we obtain the unitary representations of
U_q(su(2)). This is achieved by finding explicit Darboux coordinates and then
using a phase space path integral. I discuss the *-structure of SU(2)* and give
a detailed description of its leaves using various parametrizations and also
compare the results with the path integral quantization of spin.
