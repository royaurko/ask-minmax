Generalizing a construction of P. Vanhaecke, we introduce a large class of
degenerate (i.e., associated to a degenerate Poisson bracket) completely
integrable systems on (a dense subset of) the space $\R^{2d+n+1}$, called the
generalized master systems. It turns out that certain generalized master
systems (with different Poisson brackets and different Hamiltonians) determine
the same Hamiltonian vector fields (and are therefore different descriptions of
the same Hamiltonian system), and that the Poisson brackets of these systems
are compatible. Consequently, our class of generalized master systems actually
consists of a (smaller) class of completely integrable systems, and our
construction yields a multi-Hamiltonian structure for these systems. As an
application, we construct a multi-Hamiltonian structure for the so-called
master systems introduced by D. Mumford.
