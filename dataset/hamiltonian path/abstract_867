Massive particles on timelike paths in spacetime can be viewed as moving on
null paths in a higher-dimensional manifold. This and other consequences follow
from the use of Campbell's theorem to embed 4D general relativity in
non-compactified 5D Kaluza-Klein theory. We now show that it is possible in
principle to obtain the standard rule for quantization in 4D from the canonical
metric with null paths in 5D. Particle mass can be wavelike, as suggested
originally by Dirac, and other 4D/5D consequences are outlined.
