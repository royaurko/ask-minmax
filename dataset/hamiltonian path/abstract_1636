We give a bijection between partially directed paths in the symmetric wedge
y= +/-x and matchings, which sends north steps to nestings. This gives a
bijective proof of a result of Prellberg et al. that was first discovered
through the corresponding generating functions: the number of partially
directed paths starting at the origin confined to the symmetric wedge y= +/-x
with k north steps is equal to the number of matchings on [2n] with k nestings.
