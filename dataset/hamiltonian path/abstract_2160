In this paper, a symplectic model reduction technique, proper symplectic
decomposition (PSD) with symplectic Galerkin projection, is proposed to save
the computational cost for the simplification of large-scale Hamiltonian
systems while preserving the symplectic structure. As an analogy to the
classical proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin approach, PSD is
designed to build a symplectic subspace to fit empirical data, while the
symplectic Galerkin projection constructs a reduced Hamiltonian system on the
symplectic subspace. For practical use, we introduce three algorithms for PSD,
which are based upon: the cotangent lift, complex singular value decomposition,
and nonlinear programming. The proposed technique has been proven to preserve
system energy and stability. Moreover, PSD can be combined with the discrete
empirical interpolation method to reduce the computational cost for nonlinear
Hamiltonian systems. Owing to these properties, the proposed technique is
better suited than the classical POD-Galerkin approach for model reduction of
Hamiltonian systems, especially when long-time integration is required. The
stability, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed technique are illustrated
through numerical simulations of linear and nonlinear wave equations.
