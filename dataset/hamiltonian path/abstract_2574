A toroidal grid graph is a Cartesian product of cycles, and the run length of
a Hamiltonian cycle in a grid graph is defined to be the maximum number r such
that any r consecutive edges include no more than one edge in any dimension. By
constructive methods, we place bounds on the maximum run length possible for a
Hamiltonian cycle in several families of grid graphs.
