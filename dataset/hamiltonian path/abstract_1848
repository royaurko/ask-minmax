Let E be an arbitrary graph and K be any field. For every non-graded ideal I
of the Leavitt path algebra L_{K}(E), we give an explicit description of the
generators of I. Using this, we show that every finitely generated ideal of
L_{K}(E) must be principal. In particular, if E is a finite graph, then every
ideal of L_{K}(E) must be principal ideal.
