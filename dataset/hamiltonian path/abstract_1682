In this paper we present a new path order for rewrite systems, the
exponential path order EPOSTAR. Suppose a term rewrite system is compatible
with EPOSTAR, then the runtime complexity of this rewrite system is bounded
from above by an exponential function. Furthermore, the class of function
computed by a rewrite system compatible with EPOSTAR equals the class of
functions computable in exponential time on a Turing maschine.
