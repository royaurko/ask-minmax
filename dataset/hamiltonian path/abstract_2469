A new Hamiltonian model is introduced to study the spectrum of light hadrons.
It combines relativistic field theory with elements of the constituent quark
model. In addition to the standard linear confining and pseudoscalar meson
exchange interactions with predetermined parameters, an additional interaction
with different covariant spin structures is examined. Using a large scale Monte
Carlo variational procedure, the resulting model Hamiltonian provides a very
good, unified description of the light quark baryon (both octet and decuplet)
and meson spectra.
