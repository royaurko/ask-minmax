We present a real-space renormalization group approach for the corner
Hamiltonian, which is relevant to the reduced density matrix in the density
matrix renormalization group. A set of self-consistent equations that the
renormalized Hamiltonian should satisfy in the thermodynamic limit is also
derived from the fixed point of the recursion relation for the corner
Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the renormalization group algorithm for the $S=1/2$
XXZ spin chain and show that the results are consistent with the exact
solution. We further examine the renormalization group for the S=1 Heisenberg
spin chain and then discuss the nature of the eigenvalue spectrum of the corner
Hamiltonian for the non-integrable model.
