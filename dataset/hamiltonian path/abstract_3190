In a coordinate free form are found the (deviation) equations satisfied by
the (infinitesimal) deviation vector, relative velocity, relative momentum,
relative acceleration and relative energy of two point particles in a
differentiable manifold the tangent bundle of which is endowed with a linear
transport along paths, a linear connection and, in the last case, also with a
metric. Some approximate relations between these quantities are obtained.
