The 3D uniformly frustrated XY model is simulated to search for a predicted
"vortex loop blowout" transition within the vortex line liquid phase of a
strongly type-II superconductor in an applied magnetic field. Results are shown
to strongly depend on the precise scheme used to trace out vortex line paths.
While we find evidence for a transverse vortex path percolation transition, no
signal of this transition is found in the specific heat.
