We give a proof of a result on the growth of the number of particles along
chosen paths in a branching Brownian motion. The work follows the approach of
classical large deviations results, in which paths in $C[0,1]$ are rescaled
onto $C[0,T]$ for large $T$. The methods used are probabilistic and take
advantage of modern spine techniques.
