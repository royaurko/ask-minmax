Choi {\it et al.} \cite{pocdim} introduced the notion of the partial order
competition dimension of a graph and studied graphs whose partial order
competition dimensions are less than or equal to three. In this paper, we
present two interesting families of graphs whose partial order competition
dimensions are greater than three. In the process, particularly, a variety of
notions such as Ramsey number, graph orientation, Hamiltonian path are
utilized.
