Hyperproperties, as introduced by Clarkson and Schneider, characterize the
correctness of a computer program as a condition on its set of computation
paths. Standard temporal logics can only refer to a single path at a time, and
therefore cannot express many hyperproperties of interest, including
noninterference and other important properties in security and coding theory.
In this paper, we investigate an extension of temporal logic with explicit path
variables. We show that the quantification over paths naturally subsumes other
extensions of temporal logic with operators for information flow and knowledge.
The model checking problem for temporal logic with path quantification is
decidable. For alternation depth 1, the complexity is PSPACE in the length of
the formula and NLOGSPACE in the size of the system, as for linear-time
temporal logic.
