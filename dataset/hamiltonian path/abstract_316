Combining first-principles calculations with a technique for many-body
problems, we investigate properties of the transition metal oxide ${\rm
Sr_{2}VO_{4}}$ from the microscopic point of view. By using the local density
approximation (LDA), the high-energy band structure is obtained, while screened
Coulomb interactions are derived from the constrained LDA and the GW method.
The renormalization of the kinetic energy is determined from the GW method. By
these downfolding procedures, an effective Hamiltonian at low energies is
derived. Applying the path integral renormalization group method to this
Hamiltonian, we obtain ground state properties such as the magnetic and orbital
orders. Obtained results are consistent with experiments within available data.
We find that ${\rm Sr_{2}VO_{4}}$ is close to the metal-insulator transition.
Furthermore, because of the coexistence and competition of ferromagnetic and
antiferromgnetic exchange interactions in this system, an antiferromagnetic and
orbital-ordered state with a nontrivial and large unit cell structure is
predicted in the ground state. The calculated optical conductivity shows
characteristic shoulder structure in agreement with the experimental results.
This suggests an orbital selective reduction of the Mott gap.
