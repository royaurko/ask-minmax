In this paper, we study a class of quasi-invariant measures on paths
generated by discrete dynamical systems. Our main result characterizes the
subfamily of these measures which admit a certain desintegration. This is a
desintegration with respect to a random walk Markov process which is indexed by
the starting point of the paths. Our applications include wavelet constructions
on Julia sets of rational maps on the Riemann sphere.
