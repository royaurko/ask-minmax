A general, consistent and complete framework for geometrical formulation of
mechanical systems is proposed, based on certain structures on affine bundles
(affgebroids) that generalize Lie algebras and Lie algebroids. This scheme
covers and unifies various geometrical approaches to mechanics in the
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian pictures, including time-dependent lagrangians and
hamiltonians. In our approach, lagrangians and hamiltonians are, in general,
sections of certain $\R$-principal bundles, and the solutions of analogs of
Euler-Lagrange equations are curves in certain affine bundles. The correct
geometrical and frame-independent description of Newtonian Mechanics is of this
type.
