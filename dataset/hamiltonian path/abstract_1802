Homotopy 3-types can be modelled algebraically by Tamsamani's weak
3-groupoids as well as, in the path-connected case, by cat^2-groups. This paper
gives a comparison between the two models in the path-connected case. This
leads to two different semistrict algebraic models of connected 3-types using
the Tamsamani's model. Both are then related to Gray groupoids.
