A multi-band effective-mass Hamiltonian is derived for lattice-matched
semiconductor nanostructures in a slowly varying external magnetic field. The
theory is derived from the first-principles magnetic-field coupling Hamiltonian
of Pickard and Mauri, which is applicable to nonlocal norm-conserving
pseudopotentials in the local density approximation to density functional
theory. The pseudopotential of the nanostructure is treated as a perturbation
of a bulk reference crystal, with linear and quadratic response terms included
in k.p perturbation theory. The resulting Hamiltonian contains several
interface terms that have not been included in previous work on nanostructures
in a magnetic field. The derivation provides the first direct analytical
expressions showing how the coupling of the nonlocal potential to the magnetic
field influences the effective magnetic dipole moment of the electron.
