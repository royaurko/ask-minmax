We consider a system of particles experiencing diffusion and mean field
interaction, and study its behaviour when the number of particles goes to
infinity. We derive non-asymptotic large deviation bounds measuring the
concentration of the empirical measure of the paths of the particles around its
limit. The method is based on a coupling argument, strong integrability
estimates on the paths in Holder norm, and some general concentration result
for the empirical measure of identically distributed independent paths.
