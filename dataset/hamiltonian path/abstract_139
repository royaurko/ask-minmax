The framework of the Perturbed Static Path Approximation (PSPA) is used to
calculate the partition function of a finite Fermi system from a Hamiltonian
with a separable two body interaction. Therein, the collective degree of
freedom is introduced in self-consistent fashion through a Hubbard-Stratonovich
transformation. In this way all transport coefficients which dominate the decay
of a meta-stable system are defined and calculated microscopically. Otherwise
the same formalism is applied as in the Caldeira-Leggett model to deduce the
decay rate from the free energy above the so called crossover temperature
$T_0$.
