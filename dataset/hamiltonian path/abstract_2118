Topological stability of the edge states is investigated for non-Hermitian
systems. We examine two classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians supporting real
bulk eigenenergies in weak non-Hermiticity: SU(1,1) and SO(3,2) Hamiltonians.
As an SU(1,1) Hamiltonian, the tight-binding model on the honeycomb lattice
with imaginary on-site potentials is examined. Edge states with ReE=0 and their
topological stability are discussed by the winding number and the index
theorem, based on the pseudo-anti-Hermiticity of the system. As a higher
symmetric generalization of SU(1,1) Hamiltonians, we also consider SO(3,2)
models. We investigate non-Hermitian generalization of the Luttinger
Hamiltonian on the square lattice, and that of the Kane-Mele model on the
honeycomb lattice, respectively. Using the generalized Kramers theorem for the
time-reversal operator Theta with Theta^2=+1 [M. Sato et al., arXiv:1106.1806],
we introduce a time-reversal invariant Chern number from which topological
stability of gapless edge modes is argued.
