We review and extend the computation of scattering amplitudes of tachyons in
the $c=1$ matrix model using a manifestly finite prescription for the
collective field hamiltonian. We give further arguments for the exactness of
the cubic hamiltonian by demonstrating the equality of the loop corrections in
the collective field theory with those calculated in the fermionic picture.
