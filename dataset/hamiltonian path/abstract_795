This paper introduces a convenient solution space for the uniformly elliptic
fully nonlinear path dependent PDEs. It provides a wellposedness result under
standard Lipschitz-type assumptions on the nonlinearity and an additional
assumption formulated on some partial differential equation defined locally by
freezing the path.
