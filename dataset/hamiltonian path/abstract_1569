We discuss the quantisation of a class of string cosmology models that are
characterized by scale factor duality invariance. We compute the amplitudes for
the full set of classically allowed and forbidden transitions by applying the
reduce phase space and the path integral methods. We show that these approaches
are consistent. The path integral calculation clarifies the meaning of the
instanton-like behaviour of the transition amplitudes that has been first
pointed out in previous investigations.
