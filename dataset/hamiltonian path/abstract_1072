This paper presents an approach to estimating a hidden process in a
continuous-time setting, where the hidden process is a diffusion. The approach
is simply to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the hidden path, where the
likelihood is expressed relative to Wiener measure. This negative
log-likelihood is the action integral of the path, which we minimize by
calculus of variations. We then perform an asymptotic maximum-likelihood
analysis to understand better how the actual path is distributed around the
least-action path; it turns out that the actual path can be expressed
(approximately) as the sum of the least-action path and a zero-mean Gaussian
process which can be specified quite explicitly. Numerical solution of the ODEs
which arise from the calculus of variations is often feasible, but is
complicated by the shooting nature of the problem, and the possibility that we
have found a local but not global minimum. We analyze the situations when this
happens, and provide effective numerical methods for studying this. We also
show how the methodology works in a situation where the hidden positive
diffusion acts as the random intensity of a point process which is observed;
here too it is possible to estimate the hidden process.
