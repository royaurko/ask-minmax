We will review some of the theoretical progresses that have been recently
done in the study of slow dynamics of glassy systems: the general techniques
used for studying the dynamics in the mean field approximation and the
emergence of a pure dynamical transition in some of these systems. We show how
the results obtained for a random Hamiltonian may be also applied to a given
Hamiltonian. These two results open the way to a better understanding of the
glassy transition in real systems.
