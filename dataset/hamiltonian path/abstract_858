Using the bijection between partitions and vacillating tableaux, we establish
a correspondence between pairs of noncrossing free Dyck paths of length $2n$
and noncrossing partitions of $[2n+1]$ with $n+1$ blocks. In terms of the
number of up steps at odd positions, we find a characterization of Dyck paths
constructed from pairs of noncrossing free Dyck paths by using the Labelle
merging algorithm.
