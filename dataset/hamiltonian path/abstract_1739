We study Donsker-Watanabe's delta functions associated with strongly
hypoelliptic diffusion processes indexed by a small parameter. They are finite
Borel measures on the Wiener space and admit a rough path lift. Our main result
is a large deviation principle of Schilder type for the lifted measures on the
geometric rough path space as the scale parameter tends to zero.
  As a corollary, we obtain a large deviation principle conjectured by Takanobu
and Watanabe, which is a generalization of a large deviation principle of
Freidlin-Wentzell type for pinned diffusion processes.
