We study the supersymmetric N=1 hierarchy connected with the Lax operator of
the supersymmetric Sawada-Kotera equation. This operator produces the physical
equations as well as the exotic equations with odd time. The odd Bi-Hamiltonian
structure for the N=1 Supersymmetric Sawada - Kotera equation is defined. The
product of the symplectic and implectic Hamiltonian operator gives us the
recursion operator. In that way we prove the integrability of the
supersymmetric Sawada - Kotera equation in the sense that it has the
Bi-Hamiltonian structure. The so called "quadratic" Hamiltonian operator of
even order generates the exotic equations while the "cubic" odd Hamiltonian
operator generates the physical equations.
