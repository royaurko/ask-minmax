We present a simple method to stabilize the optical path length of an optical
fiber to an accuracy of about 1/100 of the laser wavelength. We study the
dynamic response of the path length to modulation of an electrically conductive
heater layer of the fiber. The path length is measured against the laser
wavelength by use of the Pound-Drever-Hall method; negative feedback is applied
via the heater. We apply the method in the context of a cryogenic resonator
frequency standard.
