We derive some large deviation bounds for events related to the "true
self-repelling motion", a one-dimensional self-interacting process introduced
by Toth and Werner, that has very different path properties than usual
diffusion processes. We then use these estimates to study certain of these path
properties such as its law of iterated logarithms for both small and large
times.
