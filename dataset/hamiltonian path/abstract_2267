In earlier work we have given a Hamiltonian analysis of Yang-Mills theory in
(2+1) dimensions showing how a mass gap could arise. In this paper,
generalizing and covariantizing from the mass term in the Hamiltonian analysis,
we obtain two manifestly covariant and gauge-invariant mass terms which can be
used in a resummation of standard perturbation theory to study properties of
the mass gap.
