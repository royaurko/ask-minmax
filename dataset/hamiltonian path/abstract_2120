Campisi, Zhan, Talkner, and Haenggi state, in promoting a new logarithmic
computational thermostat [ arXiv 1203.5968 and 1204.4412 ], that (thermostated)
Nose-Hoover mechanics is not Hamiltonian. First I point out that Dettmann
clearly showed the Hamiltonian nature of Nose-Hoover mechanics. The
trajectories {q(t)} generated by Dettmann's Hamiltonian are identical to those
generated by Nose-Hoover mechanics. I also observe that when the (Hamiltonian)
Campisi thermostat is applied to "nonequilibrium" heat transfer problems some
very interesting, and somewhat paradoxical, phase portraits can result. See too
Marc Mel\'endez' nice arXiv 1205.3478 and our joint work 1206.0188 .
