We calculate the zero-temperature resistivity of model 3-dimensional
disordered metals described by tight-binding Hamiltonians. Two different
mechanisms of disorder are considered: diagonal and off-diagonal. The
non-equilibrium Green function formalism provides a Landauer-type formula for
the conductance of arbitrary mesoscopic systems. We use this formula to
calculate the resistance of finite-size disordered samples of different
lengths. The resistance averaged over disorder configurations is linear in
sample length and resistivity is found from the coefficient of proportionality.
Two structures are considered: (1) a simple cubic lattice with one s-orbital
per site, (2) a simple cubic lattice with two d-orbitals. For small values of
the disorder strength, our results agree with those obtained from the Boltzmann
equation. Large off-diagonal disorder causes the resistivity to saturate,
whereas increasing diagonal disorder causes the resistivity to increase faster
than the Boltzmann result. The crossover toward localization starts when the
Boltzmann mean free path relative to the lattice constant has a value between
0.5 and 2.0 and is strongly model dependent.
