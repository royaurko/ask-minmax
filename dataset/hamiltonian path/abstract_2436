This paper examines the features of a generalized position-dependent mass
Hamiltonian in a supersymmetric framework in which the constraints of
pseudo-Hermiticity and CPT are naturally embedded. Different representations of
the charge operator are considered that lead to new mass-deformed
superpotentials which are inherently PT-symmetric. The qualitative spectral
behavior of the Hamiltonian is studied and several interesting consequences are
noted.
