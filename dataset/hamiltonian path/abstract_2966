We adapt the compression algorithm of Weinstein, Auerbach, and Chandra from
eigenvectors of spin lattice Hamiltonians to eigenvectors of light-front
field-theoretic Hamiltonians. The latter are approximated by the standard
discrete light-cone quantization technique, which provides a matrix
representation of the Hamiltonian eigenvalue problem. The eigenvectors are
represented as singular value decompositions of two-dimensional arrays, indexed
by transverse and longitudinal momenta, and compressed by truncation of the
decomposition. The Hamiltonian is represented by a rank-four tensor that is
decomposed as a sum of contributions factorized into direct products of
separate matrices for transverse and longitudinal interactions. The algorithm
is applied to a model theory, to illustrate its use.
