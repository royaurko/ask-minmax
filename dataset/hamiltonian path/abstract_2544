We construct a new supersymmetric two boson (sTB-B) hierarchy and study its
properties. We derive the conserved quantities and the Hamiltonian structures
(proving the Jacobi identity) for the system. We show how this system gives the
sKdV-B equation and its Hamiltonian structures upon appropriate reduction. We
also describe the zero curvature formulation of this hierarchy both in the
superspace as well as in components.
