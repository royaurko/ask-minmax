The Hamiltonian structure for the supersymmetric $N=2$ Novikov equation is
presented. The bosonic sector give us two-component generalization of the cubic
peakon equation. The double extended: two-component and two-peakon Novikov
equation is defined. The Bi-Hamiltonian structure for this extended system is
constructed.
