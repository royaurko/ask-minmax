Starting from the construction of a geometric rough path associated with a
fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in]{1/4}, {1/2}[$ given by
Coutin and Qian (2002), we prove a large deviation principle in the space of
geometric rough paths, extending classical results on Gaussian processes. As a
by-product, geometric rough paths associated to elements of the reproducing
kernel Hilbert space of the fractional Brownian motion are obtained and an
explicit integral representation is given.
