We construct a two-parametric family of exactly solvable Dirac Hamiltonians
by the Darboux transformation method. We obtain intertwining relations between
different members of the Hamiltonian family. We investigate the spectral
properties of the obtained Hamiltonians and the explicit forms of their
eigenfunctions.
