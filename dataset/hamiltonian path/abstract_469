Sampling-based motion planners are an effective means for generating
collision-free motion paths. However, the quality of these motion paths (with
respect to quality measures such as path length, clearance, smoothness or
energy) is often notoriously low, especially in high-dimensional configuration
spaces. We introduce a simple algorithm for merging an arbitrary number of
input motion paths into a hybrid output path of superior quality, for a broad
and general formulation of path quality. Our approach is based on the
observation that the quality of certain sub-paths within each solution may be
higher than the quality of the entire path. A dynamic-programming algorithm,
which we recently developed for comparing and clustering multiple motion paths,
reduces the running time of the merging algorithm significantly. We tested our
algorithm in motion-planning problems with up to 12 degrees of freedom. We show
that our algorithm is able to merge a handful of input paths produced by
several different motion planners to produce output paths of much higher
quality.
