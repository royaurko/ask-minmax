Propagation of light in a metamaterial medium which mimics curved spacetime
and acts like a black hole is studied. We show that in a particular type of
spacetimes, the time and space metric coefficients may correspond to different
properties of the medium. For a TE wave, the time dilation appears as
dielectric permittivity, while the spatial curvature manifests as magnetic
permeability, and vice versa for a TM wave. We obtain the optical analogue to
the relativistic Hamiltonian which determines the ray paths (null geodesics) in
the anisotropic metamaterial. By applying the formalism to the Schwarzschild
metric, we compare the ray paths with full-wave simulations in the effective
medium and obtain a very good correspondence. As an interesting feature we find
that light does not propagate in the direction of the wave normal, there is an
angle between the wave velocity and the ray velocity.
