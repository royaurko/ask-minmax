By carefully analyzing the relations between operator methods and the
discretized and continuum path integral formulations of quantum-mechanical
systems, we have found the correct Feynman rules for one-dimensional path
integrals in curved spacetime. Although the prescription how to deal with the
products of distributions that appear in the computation of Feynman diagrams in
configuration space is surprising, this prescription follows unambiguously from
the discretized path integral. We check our results by an explicit two-loop
calculation.
