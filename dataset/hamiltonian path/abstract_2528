The multiscale Monte-Carlo algorithm outlined in Bai and Brandt[1] is applied
to a simple model of the polypeptide backbone. Effective coarse level
Hamiltonians are derived by a fast Newtonian iterative scheme. The coarse
Hamiltonian parameters are adjusted so that local structural properties have
the same value in both coarse and fine level simulations. It is demonstrated
that at convergence of iterations, global structural properties are reproduced
very well in coarse level simulations.
