A graph is Hamiltonian if it contains a cycle which passes through every
vertex of the graph exactly once. A classical theorem of Dirac from 1952
asserts that every graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $n/2$ is
Hamiltonian. We refer to such graphs as Dirac graphs. In this paper we extend
Dirac's theorem in two directions and show that Dirac graphs are robustly
Hamiltonian in a very strong sense. First, we consider a random subgraph of a
Dirac graph obtained by taking each edge independently with probability $p$,
and prove that there exists a constant $C$ such that if $p \ge C \log n / n$,
then a.a.s. the resulting random subgraph is still Hamiltonian. Second, we
prove that if a $(1:b)$ Maker-Breaker game is played on a Dirac graph, then
Maker can construct a Hamiltonian subgraph as long as the bias $b$ is at most
$cn /\log n$ for some absolute constant $c > 0$. Both of these results are
tight up to a constant factor, and are proved under one general framework.
