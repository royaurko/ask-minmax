We develop a basic formulation of the spin (SU(2)) coherent state path
integrals based not on the conventional highest or lowest weight vectors but on
arbitrary fiducial vectors. The coherent states, being defined on a 3-sphere,
are specified by a full set of Euler angles. They are generally considered as
states without classical analogues. The overcompleteness relation holds for the
states, by which we obtain the time evolution of general systems in terms of
the path integral representation; the resultant Lagrangian in the action has a
monopole-type term a la Balachandran etal. as well as some additional terms,
both of which depend on fiuducial vectors in a simple way. The process of the
discrete path integrals to the continuous ones is clarified. Complex variable
forms of the states and path integrals are also obtained. During the course of
all steps, we emphasize the analogies and correspondences to the general
canonical coherent states and path integrals that we proposed some time ago. In
this paper we concentrate on the basic formulation. The physical applications
as well as criteria in choosing fiducial vectors for real Lagrangians, in
relation to fictitious monopoles and geometric phases, will be treated in
subsequent papers separately.
