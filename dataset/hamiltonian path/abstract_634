We give meaning to linear and semi-linear (possibly degenerate) parabolic
partial differential equations with (affine) linear rough path noise and
establish stability in a rough path metric. In the case of enhanced Brownian
motion (Brownian motion with its L\'evy area) as rough path noise the solution
coincides with the standard variational solution of the SPDE.
