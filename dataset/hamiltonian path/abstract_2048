This paper describes a novel framework for computing geodesic paths in shape
spaces of spherical surfaces under an elastic Riemannian metric. The novelty
lies in defining this Riemannian metric directly on the quotient (shape) space,
rather than inheriting it from pre-shape space, and using it to formulate a
path energy that measures only the normal components of velocities along the
path. In other words, this paper defines and solves for geodesics directly on
the shape space and avoids complications resulting from the quotient operation.
This comprehensive framework is invariant to arbitrary parameterizations of
surfaces along paths, a phenomenon termed as gauge invariance. Additionally,
this paper makes a link between different elastic metrics used in the computer
science literature on one hand, and the mathematical literature on the other
hand, and provides a geometrical interpretation of the terms involved. Examples
using real and simulated 3D objects are provided to help illustrate the main
ideas.
