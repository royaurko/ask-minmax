We provide analytic solutions of the nonlinear differential equation system
describing the particle paths below small-amplitude periodic gravity waves
travelling on a constant vorticity current. We show that these paths are not
closed curves. Some solutions can be expressed in terms of Jacobi elliptic
functions, others in terms of hyperelliptic functions. We obtain new kinds of
particle paths. We make some remarks on the stagnation points which could
appear in the fluid due to the vorticity.
