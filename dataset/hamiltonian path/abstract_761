We show that, for a class of systems described by a Lagrangian L(x,\dot{x},t)
= 1/2\dot{x}^{2} - V(x,t) the propagator can be reduced via Noether's Theorem
to a standard path integral multiplied by a phase factor. Using Henstock's
integration technique, this path integral is given a firm mathematical basis.
Finally, we recast the propagator as an evolutionary semigroup.
