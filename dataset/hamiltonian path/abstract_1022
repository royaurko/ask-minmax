The coupling of non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonians to standard Hermitian
Hamiltonians, each of which individually has a real energy spectrum, is
explored by means of a number of soluble models. It is found that in all cases
the energy remains real for small values of the coupling constant, but becomes
complex if the coupling becomes stronger than some critical value. For a
quadratic non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonian coupled to an arbitrary real
Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonian, the reality of the ground-state energy for
small enough coupling constant is established up to second order in
perturbation theory.
