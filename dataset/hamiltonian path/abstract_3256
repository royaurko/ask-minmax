For given graphs $G$ and $H,$ the \emph{Ramsey number} $R(G,H)$ is the least
natural number $n$ such that for every graph $F$ of order $n$ the following
condition holds: either $F$ contains $G$ or the complement of $F$ contains $H.$
In this paper, we determine the Ramsey number of paths versus generalized
Jahangir graphs. We also derive the Ramsey number $R(tP_n,H)$, where $H$ is a
generalized Jahangir graph $J_{s,m}$ where $s\geq2$ is even, $m\geq3$ and
$t\geq1$ is any integer.
