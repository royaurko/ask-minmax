This paper contains the details of Phys. Rev. Lett. 73, 2919 (1994) and, to a
lesser extent, Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 3710 (1994). We treat a Hubbard model which
includes all the 3d states of the Cu ions and the 2p states of the O ions. We
also include spin-orbit interactions, hopping between ground and excited
crystal field states of the Cu ions, and rather general Coulomb interactions.
Our analytic results for the spin Hamiltonian, H, are corroborated by numerical
evaluations of the energy splitting of the ground manifold for two holes on
either a pair of Cu ions or a Cu-O-Cu complex. In the tetragonal symmetry case
and for the model considered, we prove that H is rotationally invariant in the
absence of Coulomb exchange. When Coulomb exchange is present, each bond
Hamiltonian has full biaxial anisotropy, as expected for this symmetry. For
lower symmetry situations, the single bond spin Hamiltonian is anisotropic at
order t**6 for constant U and at order t**2 for nonconstant U. (Constant U
means that the Coulomb interaction between orbitals does not depend on which
orbitals are involved.)
