Recently, several papers have been dedicated to the Wigner quantization of
different Hamiltonians. In these examples, many interesting mathematical and
physical properties have been shown. Among those we have the ubiquitous
relation with Lie superalgebras and their representations. In this paper, we
study two one-dimensional Hamiltonians for which the Wigner quantization is
related with the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp(1|2). One of them, the
Hamiltonian H = xp, is popular due to its connection with the Riemann zeros,
discovered by Berry and Keating on the one hand and Connes on the other. The
Hamiltonian of the free particle, H_f = p^2/2, is the second Hamiltonian we
will examine. Wigner quantization introduces an extra representation parameter
for both of these Hamiltonians. Canonical quantization is recovered by
restricting to a specific representation of the Lie superalgebra osp(1|2).
