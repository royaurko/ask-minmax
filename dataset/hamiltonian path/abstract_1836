We describe a new framework for soft gluon resummation, based on path
integral methods. The approach recovers previous results obtained in the
eikonal approximation, in which all emitted gluons become soft. Furthermore, a
clear physical interpretation allows straightforward extension of the framework
to beyond the eikonal approximation, and we use this to classify the structure
of next-to-eikonal corrections to matrix elements.
