The extreme anisotropic limit of Euclidean SU(3) lattice gauge theory is
examined to extract the Hamiltonian limit, using standard path integral Monte
Carlo (PIMC) methods. We examine the mean plaquette and string tension and
compare them to results obtained within the Hamiltonian framework of Kogut and
Susskind. The results are a significant improvement upon previous Hamiltonian
estimates, despite the extrapolation procedure necessary to extract
observables. We conclude that the PIMC method is a reliable method of obtaining
results for the Hamiltonian version of the theory. Our results also clearly
demonstrate the universality between the Hamiltonian and Euclidean formulations
of lattice gauge theory. It is particularly important to take into account the
renormalization of both the anisotropy, and the Euclidean coupling $ \beta_E $,
in obtaining these results.
