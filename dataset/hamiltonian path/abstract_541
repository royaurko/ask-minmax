We study the applicability of XML path summaries in the context of
current-day XML databases. We find that summaries provide an excellent basis
for optimizing data access methods, which furthermore mixes very well with
path-partitioned stores. We provide practical algorithms for building and
exploiting summaries, and prove its benefits through extensive experiments.
