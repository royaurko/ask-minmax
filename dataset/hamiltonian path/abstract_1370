In a paper appearing in Annalen der Physik in 1930 Leon Rosenfeld invented
the first procedure for producing Hamiltonian constraints. He displayed and
correctly distinguished the vanishing Hamiltonian generator of time evolution,
and the vanishing generator of gauge transformations for general relativity
with Dirac electron and electrodynamic field sources. Though he did not do so,
had he chosen one of his tetrad fields to be normal to his spacetime foliation,
he would have anticipated by almost thirty years the general relativisitic
Hamiltonian first published by Paul Dirac.
