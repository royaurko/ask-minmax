In this paper we explore the idea of looking at the Dirac quantisation
conditions as $\hbar$-dependent constraints on the tangent bundle to
phase-space. Starting from the path-integral version of classical
mechanics and using the natural Poisson brackets structure present in the
cotangent bundle to the tangent bundle of phase- space, we handle the above
constraints using the standard theory of Dirac for constrained systems. The
hope is to obtain, as total Hamiltonian, the Moyal operator of time-evolution
and as Dirac brackets the Moyal ones. Unfortunately the program fails
indicating that something is missing. We put forward at the end some ideas for
future work which may overcome this failure.
