A new charge quantization in a phase-polarized Cooper Pair Pump (CPP) is
proposed, based on the topological properties of its Hamiltonian ground state
over a three-dimensional parameter space $\mathbb{P}$. The charge is quantized
using a set of path in $\mathbb{P}$ covering the surface of a torus, and is a
multiple of the integer Chern index $c_1$ of this surface. This quantization is
asymptotic but the pumped charge converges rapidly to the quantized value with
the increase in the path frequency. The topological nature of the current makes
this CPP implementation an excellent candidate for a metrological current
standard.
