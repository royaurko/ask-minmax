In this paper, constrained Hamiltonian systems with linear velocities are
investigated by using the Hamilton-Jacobi method. We shall consider the
integrablity conditions on the equations of motion and the action function as
well in order to obtain the path integral quantization of singular Lagrangians
with linear velocities.
