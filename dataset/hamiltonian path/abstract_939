Let M(n,k,r,s) be the number of ordered paths in the plane, with unit steps E
or N, that intersect k times in which the first path ends at the point (r,n-r)
and the second path ends at the point (s,n-s). Our main object of study in this
paper is the sum of the numbers M(n,k,r,s) over r and s where r+s is fixed. We
consider even and odd values of r+s separately, and we derive a simpler formula
for M(n,k,r,s) than previously appeared in the literature.
