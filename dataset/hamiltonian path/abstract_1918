Path planning and obstacle avoidance are the two major issues in any
navigation system. Wavefront propagation algorithm, as a good path planner, can
be used to determine an optimal path. Obstacle avoidance can be achieved using
possibility theory. Combining these two functions enable a robot to
autonomously navigate to its destination. This paper presents the approach and
results in implementing an autonomous navigation system for an indoor mobile
robot. The system developed is based on a laser sensor used to retrieve data to
update a two dimensional world model of therobot environment. Waypoints in the
path are incorporated into the obstacle avoidance. Features such as ageing of
objects and smooth motion planning are implemented to enhance efficiency and
also to cater for dynamic environments.
