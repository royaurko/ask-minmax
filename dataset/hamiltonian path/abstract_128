We consider quantization of the Baierlein-Sharp-Wheeler form of the
gravitational action, in which the lapse function is determined from the
Hamiltonian constraint. This action has a square root form, analogous to the
actions of the relativistic particle and Nambu string. We argue that
path-integral quantization of the gravitational action should be based on a
path integrand $\exp[ \sqrt{i} S ]$ rather than the familiar Feynman expression
$\exp[ i S ]$, and that unitarity requires integration over manifolds of both
Euclidean and Lorentzian signature. We discuss the relation of this path
integral to our previous considerations regarding the problem of time, and
extend our approach to include fermions.
