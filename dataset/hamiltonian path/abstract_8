We introduce a path-dependent hamiltonian representation (the path
representation) for SU(2) with fermions in 3 + 1 dimensions. The
gauge-invariant operators and hamiltonian are realized in a Hilbert space of
open path and loop functionals. We obtain two new types of Mandelstam
identities one that connects open path operators with loop operators and other
involving the end points of the paths.
