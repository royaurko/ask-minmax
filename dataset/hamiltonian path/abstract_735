Let $A$ and $B$ be disjoint sets, of size $2^k$, of vertices of $Q_n$, the
$n$-dimensional hypercube. In 1997, Bollob\'as and Leader proved that there
must be $(n-k)2^k$ edge-disjoint paths between such $A$ and $B$. They
conjectured that when $A$ is a down-set and $B$ is an up-set, these paths may
be chosen to be directed (that is, the vertices in the path form a chain). We
use a novel type of compression argument to prove stronger versions of these
conjectures, namely that the largest number of edge-disjoint paths between a
down-set $A$ and an up-set $B$ is the same as the largest number of directed
edge-disjoint paths between $A$ and $B$. Bollob\'as and Leader made an
analogous conjecture for vertex-disjoint paths and we prove a strengthening of
this by similar methods. We also prove similar results for all other sizes of
$A$ and $B$.
