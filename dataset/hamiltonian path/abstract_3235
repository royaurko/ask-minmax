There is a strikingly simple classical formula for the number of lattice
paths avoiding the line x = ky when k is a positive integer. We show that the
natural generalization of this simple formula continues to hold when the line x
= ky is replaced by certain periodic staircase boundaries--but only under
special conditions. The simple formula fails in general, and it remains an open
question to what extent our results can be further generalized.
