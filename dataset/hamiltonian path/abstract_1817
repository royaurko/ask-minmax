It has been suggested that the uncertainty in the measurement of a particle's
momentum could be made arbitrarily small by observing the particle at two ends
of an arbitrarily long flight path. However, consideration of the nature of the
detection process shows that the usual limits of the uncertainty principle hold
independent of the length of the flight path.
