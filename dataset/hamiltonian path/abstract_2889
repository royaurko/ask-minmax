This paper is devoted to the multiple-quantum (MQ) NMR spectroscopy in
nanopores filled by a gas of spin-carrying molecules (s=1/2) in a strong
external magnetic field. It turned out that the high symmetry of the spin
system in nanopores yields a possibility to overcome the problem of the
exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with an increase in the
number of spins and to investigate MQ NMR dynamics in systems consisting of
several hundred spins. We investigate the dependence of the MQ coherence
intensities on their order (the profile of the MQ coherence intensities) for a
spin system governed by the standard MQ NMR Hamiltonian (the nonsecular
two-quantum/two-spin Hamiltonian) together with the second order correction of
the average Hamiltonian theory. It is shown that the profile depends on the
value of this correction and varies from the exponential to the logarithmic
one.
