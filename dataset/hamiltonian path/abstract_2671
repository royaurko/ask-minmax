In this brief report, we show the equivalence between the tight-binding
descriptions of the monolayer and bilayer honeycomb lattices. With appropriate
value of the third nearest neighbors coupling, the Hamiltonian for a monolayer
is equivalent to the low energy effective Hamiltonian for bilayer in the
presence of trigonal warping. A simple physical argument is provided to explain
this correspondance.
