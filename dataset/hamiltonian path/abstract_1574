We present some results coming from a Monte Carlo simulation of a set of
random paths with a curvature dependent action. This model can be considered as
a toy model of the theory of random surfaces. The transition from free to rigid
random paths has been analyzed and the similitude with the crumpling transition
have been pointed out.
