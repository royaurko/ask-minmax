In this paper we systematically investigate the connections between logics
with a finite number of variables, structures of bounded pathwidth, and linear
Datalog Programs. We prove that, in the context of Constraint Satisfaction
Problems, all these concepts correspond to different mathematical embodiments
of a unique robust notion that we call bounded path duality. We also study the
computational complexity implications of the notion of bounded path duality. We
show that every constraint satisfaction problem $\csp(\best)$ with bounded path
duality is solvable in NL and that this notion explains in a uniform way all
families of CSPs known to be in NL. Finally, we use the results developed in
the paper to identify new problems in NL.
