We perform a first principles computation of the spectrum of gravity waves
produced in open inflationary universes. The background spacetime is taken to
be the continuation of an instanton saddle point of the Euclidean no boundary
path integral. The two-point tensor correlator is computed directly from the
path integral and is shown to be unique and well behaved in the infrared. We
discuss the tensor contribution to the cosmic microwave background anisotropy
and show how it may provide an observational discriminant between different
types of primordial instantons.
