In this paper we review the recently proposed path-integral counterpart of
the Koopman-von Neumann operatorial approach to classical Hamiltonian
mechanics. We identify in particular the geometrical variables entering this
formulation and show that they are essentially a basis of the cotangent bundle
to the tangent bundle to phase-space. In this space we introduce an extended
Poisson brackets structure which allows us to re-do all the usual Cartan
calculus on symplectic manifolds via these brackets. We also briefly sketch how
the Schouten-Nijenhuis, the Fr\"olicher- Nijenhuis and the Nijenhuis-Richardson
brackets look in our formalism.
