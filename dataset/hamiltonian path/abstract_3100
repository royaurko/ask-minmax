Path-integral for theories with degenerate vacua is investigated. The origin
of the non Borel-summability of the perturbation theory is studied. A new
prescription to deal with small coupling is proposed. It leads to a series,
which at low orders and small coupling differs from the ordinary perturbative
series by nonperturbative amount, but is Borel-summable.
