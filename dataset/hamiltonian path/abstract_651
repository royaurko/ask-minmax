A graph on $2k$ vertices is path-pairable if for any pairing of the vertices
the pairs can be joined by edge-disjoint paths. The so far known families of
path-pairable graphs have diameter of length at most 3. In this paper we
present an infinite family of path-pairable graphs with diameter
$d(G)=O(\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ denotes the number of vertices of the graph. We
prove that our example is extremal up to a constant factor.
