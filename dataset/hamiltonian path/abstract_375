A graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is Hamiltonian if it contains a spanning cycle,
and pancyclic if it contains cycles of all lengths from 3 to $n$. In 1984, Fan
presented a degree condition involving every pair of vertices at distance two
for a 2-connected graph to be Hamiltonian. Motivated by Fan's result, we say
that an induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ is $f_1$-heavy if for every pair of
vertices $u,v\in V(H)$, $d_{H}(u,v)=2$ implies $\max\{d(u),d(v)\}\geq (n+1)/2$.
For a given graph $R$, $G$ is called $R$-$f_1$-heavy if every induced subgraph
of $G$ isomorphic to $R$ is $f_1$-heavy. In this paper we show that for a
connected graph $S$ with $S\neq P_3$ and a 2-connected claw-$f_1$-heavy graph
$G$ which is not a cycle, $G$ being $S$-$f_1$-heavy implies $G$ is pancyclic if
$S=P_4,Z_1$ or $Z_2$, where claw is $K_{1,3}$ and $Z_i$ is the path
$a_1a_2a_3... a_{i+2}a_{i+3}$ plus the edge $a_1a_3$. Our result partially
improves a previous theorem due to Bedrossian on pancyclicity of 2-connected
graphs.
