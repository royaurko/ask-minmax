Path integral Monte Carlo simulations are applied to study dense atomic
hydrogen in the regime where the protons form a Wigner crystal. The interaction
of the protons with the degenerate electron gas is modeled by Thomas-Fermi
screening, which leads to a Yukawa potential for the proton-proton interaction.
A numerical technique for the derivation of the corresponding action of the
paths is described. For a fixed density of rs=200, the melting is analyzed
using the Lindemann ratio, the structure factor and free energy calculations.
Anharmonic effects in the crystal vibrations are analyzed.
