The signature of a path is the collection of all iterated integrals of the
path. It plays a fundamental role in rough path theory. B. Hambly and T. Lyons
proved that the signature of a path with bounded total variation is trivial if
and only if the path is the image of some closed path in a real tree. Extending
their result to general rough paths has been an important open problem in rough
path theory. We propose a proof for this conjecture in the case of weakly
geometric rough paths in finite dimensions.
