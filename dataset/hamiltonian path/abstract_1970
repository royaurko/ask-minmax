Graph theory is increasingly commonly utilised in genetics, proteomics and
neuroimaging. In such fields, the data of interest generally constitute
weighted graphs. Analysis of such weighted graphs often require the integration
of topological metrics with respect to the density of the graph. Here, density
refers to the proportion of the number of edges present in that graph. When
topological metrics based on shortest paths are of interest, such
density-integration usually necessitates the iterative application of
Dijkstra's algorithm in order to compute the shortest path matrix at each
density level. In this short note, we describe a recursive shortest path
algorithm based on single edge updating, which replaces the need for the
iterative use of Dijkstra's algorithm. Our proposed procedure is based on pairs
of breadth-first searches around each of the vertices incident to the edge
added at each recursion. An algorithmic analysis of the proposed technique is
provided. When the graph of interest is coded as an adjacency list, our
algorithm can be shown to be more efficient than an iterative use of Dijkstra's
algorithm.
