The main purpose of this paper is to study the length minimizing property of
Hamiltonian paths on closed symplectic manifolds $(M,\omega)$ such that there
are no spherical homology class $A \in H_2(M)$ with $$ \omega(A) > 0 \quad
\text{and} \quad -n \leq c_1(A) < 0, $$ which we call {\it very strongly
semi-positive}. We introduce the notion of {\it positively $\mu$-undertwisted}
Hamiltonian paths and prove that any positively undertwisted quasi-autonomous
Hamiltonian path is length minimizing in its homotopy class as long as it has a
fixed maximum and a fixed minimum point that are generically under-twisted.
This class of Hamiltonian can have non-constant large periodic orbits. The
proof uses the chain level Floer theory, spectral invariants of Hamiltonian
diffeomorphisms and the argument involving the thick and thin decomposition of
Floer's moduli space of perturbed Cauchy-Riemann equation. And then based on
this theorem and some closedness of length minimizing property, we relate the
Minimality Conjecture on the very strongly semi-positive symplectic manifolds
to a $C^1$-perturbation problem of Hamiltonian functions on general symplectic
manifolds, which we also formulate here.
