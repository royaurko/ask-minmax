Using the recently developed Nth-order muffin-tin-orbital (NMTO) based
downfolding technique we revisit the electronic properties of half-metallic
ferromagnets, the semi-Heusler NiMnSb and rutile CrO2. The NMTO Wannier
orbitals for the Mn-d and Cr-t2g manifolds are constructed and the mechanism of
chemical bonding is discussed. The effective hopping Hamiltonian parameters are
calculated using a NMTO downfolded basis set. We propose model Hamiltonian
parameters with possibly minimal basis sets for both half-metallic
ferromagnetic alloys.
