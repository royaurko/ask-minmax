Two Hamilton paths in $K_n$ are separated by a cycle of length $k$ if their
union contains such a cycle. For small fixed values of $k$ we bound the
asymptotics of the maximum cardinality of a family of Hamilton paths in $K_n$
such that any pair of paths in the family is separated by a cycle of length
$k.$
