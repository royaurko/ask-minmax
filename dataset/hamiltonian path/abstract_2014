Quantum field theory in curved spacetime may be defined either through a
manifestly unitary canonical approach or via the manifestly covariant path
integral formalism. For gauge theories, these two approaches have produced
conflicting results, leading to the question of whether the canonical approach
is covariant, and whether the path integral approach is unitary. We show the
unitarity of the covariant U(1) Maxwell theory, defined via the Wick rotation
of a Euclidean path integral. We begin by gauge-fixing the path integral,
taking care with zero modes, large gauge transformations, and nontrivial
bundles. We find an extra geometric factor in the partition function that has
been overlooked in previous work, coming from the zero mode of the gauge
symmetry, which affects the entropy and stress-energy tensor. With this extra
factor, the covariant calculation agrees with the canonical result for
ultrastatic manifolds, and in D = 2. Finally, we argue that if there exists a
unitary (but not necessarily covariant) canonical formulation, then the
covariant formulation must also be unitary, even if the two approaches
disagree.
