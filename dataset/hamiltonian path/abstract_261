Employing a cranking Hamiltonian, in the static path approximation to the
partition function, we have studied the behaviour of the moment of inertia of
$^{64}Zn$ at a few values of temperatures as a function of the rotation
frequency. At a low temperature T = 0.5 MeV and J=16 rotational alignment of
$0g_{9/2}$ orbitals takes place. But at a high temperature T = 2.0 MeV about 40
- 45$\%$ of all the angular momenta are generated by the alignment of the same
orbitals. This should imply a decrease in collectivity for all the spins at
high temperatures.
