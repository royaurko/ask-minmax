From the Hamiltonian structure of the Vlasov equation, we build a Hamiltonian
model for the first three moments of the Vlasov distribution function, namely,
the density, the momentum density and the specific internal energy. We derive
the Poisson bracket of this model from the Poisson bracket of the Vlasov
equation, and we discuss the associated Casimir invariants.
