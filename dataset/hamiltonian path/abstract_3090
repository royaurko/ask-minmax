In the electroweak sector of the standard model topologically inequivalent
vacua are separated by finite energy barriers, whose height is given by the
sphale\-ron. For large values of the Higgs mass there exist several sphaleron
solutions and the barriers are no longer symmetric. We construct paths of
classical configurations from one vacuum to a neighbouring one and solve the
fermion equations in the background field configurations along such paths,
choosing the fermions of a doublet degenerate in mass. As in the case of light
Higgs masses we observe the level crossing phenomenon also for large Higgs
masses.
