It is shown, that the geometrical objects of Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism--
odd symplectic structure and nilpotent operator $\Delta$ can be naturally
uncorporated in Duistermaat--Heckman localization procedure. The presence of
the supersymmetric bi-Hamiltonian dynamics with even and odd symplectic
structure in this procedure is established. These constructions can be
straightly generalized for the path-integral case.
