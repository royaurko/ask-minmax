Path integral for the $SU(2)$ spin system is reconsidered. We show that the
Nielsen-Rohrlich(NR) formula is equivalent to the spin coherent state
expression so that the phase space in the NR formalism is not topologically
nontrivial. We also perform the WKB approximation in the NR formula and find
that it gives the exact result.
