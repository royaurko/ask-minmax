The restricted class of Natanzon potentials with two free parameters is
studied within the context of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics. The hierarchy
of Hamiltonians is indicated, where the first members of the superfamily are
explicitly evaluated and a general form for the superpotential is proposed.
