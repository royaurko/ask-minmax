Olum (PRL 81 3567-3570, 1998) has defined "superluminality" as the ability of
a signal path to carry information faster than any neighbouring signal path,
and has suggested that this requires a negative energy-density. However, this
condition can be created without exotic matter if we are only sending
information along the delivery path in one particular direction, and restrict
ourselves to experiments that do not involve the speed of any
counterpropagating or return-trip signals. Although negative energy-densities
may be required for enhanced transit speeds in both directions along a single
path at the same time, a traveller will normally not need (or want!) to travel
in two opposing directions at once, so the condition of bidirectionality that
gives rise to the negative energy condition may be unnecessarily restrictive.
