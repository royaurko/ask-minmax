This paper presents methodologies to discretize nominal robot paths extracted
from 3-D CAD drawings. Behind robot path discretization is the ability to have
a robot adjusting the traversed paths so that the contact between robot tool
and work-piece is properly maintained. In addition, a hybrid force/motion
control system based on Fuzzy-PI control is proposed to adjust robot paths with
external sensory feedback. All these capabilities allow to facilitate the robot
programming process and to increase the robots autonomy.
