It is argued that renormalisation group flow can be interpreted as being a
Hamiltonian vector flow on a phase space which consists of the couplings of the
theory and their conjugate \lq\lq momenta", which are the vacuum expectation
values of the corresponding composite operators. The Hamiltonian is linear in
the conjugate variables and can be identified with the vacuum expectation value
of the trace of the energy-momentum operator. For theories with massive
couplings the identity operator plays a central role and its associated
coupling gives rise to a potential in the flow equations. The evolution of any
quantity , such as $N$-point Green functions, under renormalisation group flow
can be obtained from its Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian. Ward identities
can be represented as constants of the motion which act as symmetry generators
on the phase space via the Poisson bracket structure.
