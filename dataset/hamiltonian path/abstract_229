Universality of correlation functions obtained in parametric random matrix
theory is explored in a multi-parameter formalism, through the introduction of
a diffusion matrix $D_{ij}(R)$, and compared to results from a multi-parameter
chaotic model. We show that certain universal correlation functions in 1-d are
no longer well defined by the metric distance between the points in parameter
space, due to a global topological dependence on the path taken. By computing
the density of diabolical points, which is found to increases quadratically
with the dimension of the space, we find a universal measure of the density of
diabolical points in chaotic systems.
