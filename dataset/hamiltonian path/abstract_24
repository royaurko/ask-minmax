Given a set $A$ of real numbers consider the complete graph on the elements
of $A$. We prove that if $A$ is an arithmetic progression then for every vertex
$a\in A$ there exists an hamiltonian path such that the absolute differences of
consecutive vertices are pairwise distinct. This result partially proves a
conjecture by Zhi-Wei Sun.
