The aim is to determine the derivations of the three series of
finite-dimensional Z-graded Lie superalgebras of Cartan-type over a field of
characteristic p > 3, called the special odd Hamiltonian superalgebras. To that
end we first determine the derivations of negative Z-degree for the restricted
and simple special odd Hamiltonian superalgebras by means of weight space
decompositions. Then the results are used to determine the derivations of
negative Z-degree for the nonrestricted and non-simple special odd Hamiltonian
superalgebras. Finally the derivation algebras and the outer derivation
algebras of those Lie superalgebras are completely determined.
