The path integral formalism is applied to derive the full partition function
of a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian describing a particle motion
in a bath of oscillators. The electronic correlations are computed versus
temperature for some choices of oscillators energies. We study the perturbing
effect of a time averaged particle path on the phonon subsystem deriving the
relevant temperature dependent cumulant corrections to the harmonic partition
function and free energy. The method has been applied to compute the total heat
capacity up to room temeperature: a low temperature upturn in the heat capacity
over temperature ratio points to a glassy like behavior ascribable to a time
dependent electronic hopping with variable range in the linear chain.
