Let \Gamma=<\alpha, \beta > be a numerical semigroup. In this article we
consider several relations between the so-called \Gamma-semimodules and lattice
paths from (0,\alpha) to (\beta,0): we investigate isomorphism classes of
\Gamma-semimodules as well as certain subsets of the set of gaps of \Gamma, and
finally syzygies of \Gamma-semimodules. In particular we compute the number of
\Gamma-semimodules which are isomorphic with their k-th syzygy for some k.
