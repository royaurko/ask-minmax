We show how to perform integrals over products of distributions in coordinate
space such as to reproduce the results of momentum space Feynman integrals in
dimensional regularization. This ensures the invariance of path integrals under
coordinate transformations. The integrals are uniquely defined by expressing
the propagators in 1- epsilon dimensions in terms of modified Bessel functions.
