In this paper, we build the foundation for a theory of controlled rough paths
on manifolds. A number of natural candidates for the definition of manifold
valued controlled rough paths are developed and shown to be equivalent. The
theory of controlled rough one-forms along such a controlled path and their
resulting integrals are then defined. This general integration theory does
require the introduction of an additional geometric structure on the manifold
which we refer to as a "parallelism." The transformation properties of the
theory under change of parallelisms is explored. Using these transformation
properties, it is shown that the integration of a smooth one-form along a
manifold valued controlled rough path is in fact well defined independent of
any additional geometric structures. We present a theory of push-forwards and
show how it is compatible with our integration theory. Lastly, we give a number
of characterizations for solving a rough differential equation when the
solution is interpreted as a controlled rough path on a manifold and then show
such solutions exist and are unique.
