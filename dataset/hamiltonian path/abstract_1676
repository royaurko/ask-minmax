In this paper pseudo-differential operators with negative definite symbols
are used to construct time- and space-inhomogeneous Markov processes. This is
achieved by using the Markov evolution system associated with the fundamental
solution of the corresponding pseudo-differential evolution equation. Negative
definite symbols are non-standard and differ significantly from the class of
H\"{o}rmander type symbols. The novelty of this work is the derivation and the
representation of the fundamental solution as a Feynman path integral. This
implies that the transition function of the constructed Markov process can be
written as a pseudo-differential operator that has a Feynman path integral as
its symbol.
