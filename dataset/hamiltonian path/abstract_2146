The question of what conditions guarantee that a symplectic $S^1$ action is
Hamiltonian has been studied for many years. In a 1998 paper, Sue Tolman and
Jonathon Weitsman proved that if the action is semifree and has a non-empty set
of isolated fixed points then the action is Hamiltonian. Furthermore, in a 2010
paper Cho, Hwang, and Suh proved in the 6-dimensional case that if we have
$b_2^+=1$ at a reduced space at a regular level $\lambda$ of the circle valued
moment map, then the action is Hamiltonian. In this paper, we will use this to
prove that certain 6-dimensional symplectic actions which are not semifree and
have a non-empty set of isolated fixed points are Hamiltonian. In this case,
the reduced spaces are 4-dimensional symplectic orbifolds, and we will resolve
the orbifold singularities and use J-holomorphic curve techniques on the
resolutions.
