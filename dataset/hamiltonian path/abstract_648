It is known that both the number of Dyck paths with $2n$ steps and $k$ peaks,
and the number of Dyck paths with $2n$ steps and $k$ steps at odd height follow
the Narayana distribution. In this paper we present a bijection which
explicitly illustrates this equinumeracy. Moreover, we extend this bijection to
bilateral Dyck paths. The restriction to Dyck paths preserves the number of
contacts.
