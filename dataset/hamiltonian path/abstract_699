An overview of Hamiltonian systems with noncanonical Poisson structures is
given. Examples of bi-Hamiltonian ode's, pde's and lattice equations are
presented. Numerical integrators using generating functions, Hamiltonian
splitting, symplectic Runge-Kutta methods are discussed for Lie-Poisson systems
and Hamiltonian systems with a general Poisson structure. Nambu-Poisson systems
and the discrete gradient methods are also presented.
