The technique of "extension" allows to build $(n+1)$-dimensional Hamiltonian
systems with a non-trivial polynomial in the momenta first integral of any
given degree starting from a $n$-dimensional Hamiltonian satisfying some
additional properties. Until now, the application of the method was restricted
to integer values of a certain fundamental parameter determining the degree of
the additional first integral. In this article we show how this technique can
be generalized to any rational value of the same parameter. Several examples
are given, among them the anisotropic oscillator and a special case of the
Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz system.
