The displacement and deviation vectors in spaces (manifolds), the tangent
bundle of which is endowed with a transport along paths, are introduced. In
case these spaces are equipped with a linear connection, the deviation
equations (between arbitrary, geodesic or not, paths) in such spaces are
investigated.
