For a set $A\subset C[0,\infty)$, we give new results on the growth of the
number of particles in a dyadic branching Brownian motion whose paths fall
within A. We show that it is possible to work without rescaling the paths. We
give large deviations probabilities as well as a more sophisticated proof of a
result on growth in the number of particles along certain sets of paths. Our
results reveal that the number of particles can oscillate dramatically. As a
byproduct of our methods we also obtain new results on the number of particles
near the frontier of the model. The methods used are entirely probabilistic.
