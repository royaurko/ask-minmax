The Tur\'an number of an r-uniform hypergraph H is the maximum number of
edges in any r-graph on n vertices which does not contain H as a subgraph. Let
P_l^(r) denote the family of r-uniform loose paths on l edges, F(k,l) denote
the family of hypergraphs consisting of k disjoint paths from P_l^(r), and
P'_l^(r) denote an r-uniform linear path on l edges. We determine precisely
ex_r(n;F(k,l)) and ex_r(n;k*P'_l^(r)), as well as the Tur\'an numbers for
forests of paths of differing lengths (whether these paths are loose or linear)
when n is appropriately large dependent on k,l,r, for r>=3. Our results build
on recent results of F\"uredi, Jiang, and Seiver who determined the extremal
numbers for individual paths, and provide more hypergraphs whose Turan numbers
are exactly determined.
