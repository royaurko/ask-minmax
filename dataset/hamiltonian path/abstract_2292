States which minimize the Schr\"odinger--Robertson uncertainty relation are
constructed as eigenstates of an operator which is a element of the $h(1)
\oplus \su(2)$ algebra. The relations with supercoherent and supersqueezed
states of the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator are given. Moreover, we are
able to compute gneneral Hamiltonians which behave like the harmonic oscillator
Hamiltonian or are related to the Jaynes--Cummings Hamiltonian.
