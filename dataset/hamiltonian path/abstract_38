The Wigner function W(q,p) is formulated as a phase-space path integral,
whereby its sign oscillations can be seen to follow from interference between
the geometrical phases of the paths. The approach has similarities to the
path-centroid method in the configuration-space path integral. Paths can be
classified by the mid-point of their ends; short paths where the mid-point is
close to (q,p) and which lie in regions of low energy (low P function of the
Hamiltonian) will dominate, and the enclosed area will determine the sign of
the Wigner function. As a demonstration, the method is applied to a sequence of
density matrices interpolating between a Poissonian number distribution and a
number state, each member of which can be represented exactly by a discretized
path integral with a finite number of vertices. Saddle point evaluation of
these integrals recovers (up to a constant factor) the WKB approximation to the
Wigner function of a number state.
