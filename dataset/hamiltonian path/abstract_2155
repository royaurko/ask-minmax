We consider the De Donder-Weyl (DW) Hamiltonian formulation of the Palatini
action of vielbein gravity formulated in terms of the solder form and spin
connection, which are treated as independent variables. The basic geometrical
constructions necessary for the DW Hamiltonian theory of vielbein gravity are
presented. We reproduce the DW Hamilton equations in the multisymplectic and
pre-multisymplectic formulations. We also give basic examples of Hamiltonian
(n-1)-forms and related Poisson brackets.
