An {\sf oriented perfect path double cover} ($\rm OPPDC$) of a graph $G$ is a
collection of directed paths in the symmetric orientation $G_s$ of $G$ such
that each edge of $G_s$ lies in exactly one of the paths and each vertex of $G$
appears just once as a beginning and just once as an end of a path. Maxov{\'a}
and Ne{\v{s}}et{\v{r}}il (Discrete Math. 276 (2004) 287-294) conjectured that
every graph except two complete graphs $K_3$ and $K_5$ has an $\rm OPPDC$ and
they proved that the minimum degree of the minimal counterexample to this
conjecture is at least four. In this paper, among some other results, we prove
that the minimal counterexample to this conjecture is 2-connected and
3-edge-connected.
