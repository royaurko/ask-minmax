We announce the following result and give several applications: A Hamiltonian
$T$-space (for $T$ a torus) with isolated fixed points is cobordant to a
disjoint union of weighted projective spaces which are constructed from its
fixed point data. The applications concern the Duistermaat-Heckman formula, the
topological Jeffrey-Kirwan localization theorem, and geometric quantization.
