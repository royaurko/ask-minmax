Let $G$ be a connected graph of chromatic number $k$. For a $k$-coloring $f$
of $G$, a full $f$-rainbow path is a path of order $k$ in $G$ whose vertices
are all colored differently by $f$.
  We show that $G$ has a $k$-coloring $f$ such that every vertex of $G$ lies on
a full $f$-rainbow path, which provides a positive answer to a question posed
by Lin (Simple proofs of results on paths representing all colors in proper
vertex-colorings, Graphs Combin. 23 (2007) 201-203). Furthermore, we show that
$G$ has a $k$-coloring $f$ such that, for every vertex $u$ of $G$, some full
$f$-rainbow path begins at $u$ provided that either $G$ has a cycle of length
$k$, or $k\geq 7$ and $G$ contains a subgraph $H$ of order $k$ and minimum
degree at least $k-3$, which solves a problem posed by Bessy and Bousquet
(Colorful paths for 3-chromatic graphs, arXiv 1503.00965v1) and verifies some
special cases of a conjecture of Akbari et al. (Colorful paths in vertex
coloring of graphs, preprint). Finally, we establish some more results on the
existence of optimal colorings with (directed) full rainbow paths.
