Chen et al. proved that every 18-tough chordal graph has a Hamilton cycle
[Networks 31 (1998), 29-38]. Improving upon their bound, we show that every
10-tough chordal graph is hamiltonian (in fact, Hamilton-connected). We use
Aharoni and Haxell's hypergraph extension of Hall's Theorem as our main tool.
