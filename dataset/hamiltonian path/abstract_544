Path integral formulation based on the canonical method is discussed. Path
integral for Yang-Mills theory is obtained by this procedure. It is shown that
gauge fixing which is essential procedure to quantize singular systems by
Faddeev's and Popov's method is not necessary if the canonical path integral
formulation is used.
