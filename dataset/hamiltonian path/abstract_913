We introduce a new representation of the paths of the Forrester-Baxter RSOS
models which represents the states of the irreducible modules of the minimal
models M(p',p). This representation is obtained by transforming the RSOS paths,
for the cases p> 2p'-2, to new paths for which horizontal edges are allowed at
certain heights. These new paths are much simpler in that their weight is
nothing but the sum of the position of the peaks. This description paves the
way for the interpretation of the RSOS paths in terms of fermi-type charged
particles out of which the fermionic characters could be obtained
constructively. The derivation of the fermionic character for p'=2 and p=kp'+/-
1 is outlined. Finally, the particles of the RSOS paths are put in relation
with the kinks and the breathers of the restricted sine-Gordon model.
