We check the eigenvalue spectrum of the $\Phi^{4}_{1+1}$ Hamiltonian against
Poisson or Wigner behavior predicted from random matrix theory. We discuss
random matrix theory as a tool to discriminate the validity of a model
Hamiltonian compared to an analytically solvable Hamiltonian or experimental
data.
