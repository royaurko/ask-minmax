There was shown that Fourier transform of the negative magnetoresistance
(NMR) which is due to interference correction to the conductivity contains the
information about the area distribution function of the closed paths and about
area dependence of the mean length of closed paths \bar{L}(S). Based on this
line of attack we suggest the method of analysis of NMR and use it for data
treatment of the NMR in 2D structure with doped barrier. There was shown that
in structure investigated \bar{L}(S)dependence is determined by the scattering
anisotropy.
