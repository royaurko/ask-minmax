In this paper we present an approach towards the comprehensive analysis of
the non-integrability of differential equations in the form $\ddot x=f(x,t)$
which is analogous to Hamiltonian systems with 1+1/2 degree of freedom. In
particular, we analyze the non-integrability of some important families of
differential equations such as Painlev\'e II, Sitnikov and Hill-Schr\"odinger
equation.
  We emphasize in Painlev\'e II, showing its non-integrability through three
different Hamiltonian systems, and also in Sitnikov in which two different
version including numerical results are shown. The main tool to study the
non-integrability of these kind of Hamiltonian systems is Morales-Ramis theory.
This paper is a very slight improvement of the talk with the almost-same title
delivered by the contributor in SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems
2007.
