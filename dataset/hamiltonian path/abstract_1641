In this paper, we first briefly survey automated termination proof methods
for higher-order calculi. We then concentrate on the higher-order recursive
path ordering, for which we provide an improved definition, the Computability
Path Ordering. This new definition appears indeed to capture the essence of
computability arguments \`a la Tait and Girard, therefore explaining the name
of the improved ordering.
