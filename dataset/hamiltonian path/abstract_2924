Building on the recently computed next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
post-Newtonian (PN) spin-orbit Hamiltonian for spinning binaries
\cite{Hartung:2011te} we extend the effective-one-body (EOB) description of the
dynamics of two spinning black-holes to NNLO in the spin-orbit interaction. The
calculation that is presented extends to NNLO the next-to-leading order (NLO)
spin-orbit Hamiltonian computed in Ref. \cite{Damour:2008qf}. The present EOB
Hamiltonian reproduces the spin-orbit coupling through NNLO in the
test-particle limit case. In addition, in the case of spins parallel or
antiparallel to the orbital angular momentum, when circular orbits exist, we
find that the inclusion of NNLO spin-orbit terms moderates the effect of the
NLO spin-orbit coupling.
