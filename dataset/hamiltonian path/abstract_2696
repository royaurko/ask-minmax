We study the static gluon and quark propagator of the Hamiltonian approach to
Quantum Chromodynamics in Coulomb gauge in one-loop Rayleigh--Schr\"odinger
perturbation theory. We show that the results agree with the equal-time limit
of the four-dimensional propagators evaluated in the functional integral
(Lagrangian) approach.
