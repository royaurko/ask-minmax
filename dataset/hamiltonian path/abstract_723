this paper presents an enhancement of the medial axis algorithm to be used
for finding the optimal shortest path for developed cognitive map. The
cognitive map has been developed, based on the architectural blueprint maps.
The idea for using the medial-axis is to find main path central pixels; each
center pixel represents the center distance between two side boarder pixels.
The need for these pixels in the algorithm comes from the need of building a
network of nodes for the path, where each node represents a turning in the real
world (left, right, critical left, critical right...). The algorithm also
ignores from finding the center pixels paths that are too small for intelligent
robot navigation. The Idea of this algorithm is to find the possible shortest
path between start and end points. The goal of this research is to extract a
simple, robust representation of the shape of the cognitive map together with
the optimal shortest path between start and end points. The intelligent robot
will use this algorithm in order to decrease the time that is needed for
sweeping the targeted building.
