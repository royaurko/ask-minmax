In this paper, we recover sparse signals from their noisy linear measurements
by solving nonlinear differential inclusions, which we call \emph{Bregman ISS}
and \emph{Linearized Bregman ISS}. We show that under proper conditions, there
exists a bias-free and sign-consistent point on their solution paths, which
corresponds to a signal that is the unbiased estimate of the true signal and
whose entries have the same signs as those of the true signs. Therefore, their
solution paths are regularization paths better than the LASSO regularization
path, since the points on the latter path are biased. We also show how to
efficiently compute their solution paths in both continuous and discretized
settings: the full solution paths can be exactly computed piece by piece, and a
discretization leads to \emph{Linearized Bregman iteration}, which is faster
and easy to parallelize. Theoretical guarantees such as sign-consistency and
minimax optimal $l_2$-error bounds are established in both continuous and
discrete settings for specific points on the paths. Early-stopping
regularization rules for identifying these points are given. The key treatment
relies on the development of differential inequalities for differential
inclusions and their discretizations.
