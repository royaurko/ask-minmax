We develop notions of twisted spinor bundle and twisted pre-quantum bundle on
quasi-Hamiltonian G-spaces. The main result of this paper is that we construct
a Dirac operator with index given by positive energy representation of loop
group. This generalizes the quantization of Hamiltonian $G$-spaces to
quasi-Hamiltonian G-spaces.
