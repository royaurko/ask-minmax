Asymptotic freedom of gluons in QCD is obtained in the leading terms of their
renormalized Hamiltonian in the Fock space, instead of considering virtual
Green's functions or scattering amplitudes. Namely, we calculate the
three-gluon interaction term in the front-form Hamiltonian for effective gluons
in the Minkowski space-time using the renormalization group procedure for
effective particles (RGPEP), with a new generator. The resulting three-gluon
vertex is a function of the scale parameter, $s$, that has an interpretation of
the size of effective gluons. The corresponding Hamiltonian running coupling
constant, $g_\lambda$, depending on the associated momentum scale $\lambda =
1/s$, is calculated in the series expansion in powers of $g_0 = g_{\lambda_0}$
up to the terms of third order, assuming some small value for $g_0$ at some
large $\lambda_0$. The result exhibits the same finite sensitivity to small-$x$
regularization as the one obtained in an earlier RGPEP calculation, but the new
calculation is simpler than the earlier one because of a simpler generator.
This result establishes a degree of universality for pure-gauge QCD in the
RGPEP.
