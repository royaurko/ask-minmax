We present the path-sum formulation for exact statistical inference of
marginals on Gaussian graphical models of arbitrary topology. The path-sum
formulation gives the covariance between each pair of variables as a branched
continued fraction of finite depth and breadth. Our method originates from the
closed-form resummation of infinite families of terms of the walk-sum
representation of the covariance matrix. We prove that the path-sum formulation
always exists for models whose covariance matrix is positive definite: i.e.~it
is valid for both walk-summable and non-walk-summable graphical models of
arbitrary topology. We show that for graphical models on trees the path-sum
formulation is equivalent to Gaussian belief propagation. We also recover, as a
corollary, an existing result that uses determinants to calculate the
covariance matrix. We show that the path-sum formulation formulation is valid
for arbitrary partitions of the inverse covariance matrix. We give detailed
examples demonstrating our results.
