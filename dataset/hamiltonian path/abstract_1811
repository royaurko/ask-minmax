Collisional effects are included in the path-integral formulation that was
proposed in one of our previous paper for the collisionless Boltzmann gas. In
calculating the number of molecules entering a six-dimensional phase volume
element due to collisions, both the colliding molecules and the scattered
molecules are allowed to have distributions; thus the calculation is done
smoothly and no singularities arise.
