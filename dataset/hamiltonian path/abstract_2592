For a differentiable map $(x_1,x_2,..., x_n)\to (X_1,X_2,..., X_n)$ that has
an inverse, we show that there exists a Nambu-Hamiltonian flow in which one of
the initial value, say $x_n$, of the map plays the role of time variable while
the others remain fixed. We present various examples which exhibit the map-flow
correspondence.
