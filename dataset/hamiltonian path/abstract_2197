In this paper we have discussed a unique general algorithm for exploring and
solving any kind of line maze with another simple one for simple mazes without
loops or loops having highest two branches none of which are inward. For the
general algorithm, we need a method to map the whole maze, which is required if
the maze is complex. The proposed maze mapping system is based on coordinate
system and after mapping the whole maze as a graph in standard 'Adjacency-list
representation' method, shortest path and shortest time path was extracted
using Dijkstra's algorithm. In order to find the coordinates of the turning
points and junctions, linear distance between the points are needed, for which
wheel encoder was used. However, due to non-linear movement of robot, the
directly measured distance from the encoder has some error and to remove this
error an idea is built up which ended by deriving equations that gives us
almost exact linear distance between two points from the reading of wheel
encoder of the robot moving in a non-linear path.
