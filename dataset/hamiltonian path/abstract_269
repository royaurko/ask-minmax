Inspired by recent measurements on Ba$_3$CuSb$_2$O$_9$, we explore the
interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom in a triangular lattice for
possible spin liquid-like behaviour. Our effective Hamiltonian describes the
magnetic Cu layer by considering superexchange paths along the intermediate
O's. A mean field study of ordered states reveals an orbitally ordered ground
state that isolates the spin degrees of freedom into spin chains. This scenario
naturally explains the linear specific heat as $T\to 0$ and, by including the
effects of additional defect Cu's sitting off the triangular planes, we find
remarkable agreement with the measured magnetic susceptibility.
