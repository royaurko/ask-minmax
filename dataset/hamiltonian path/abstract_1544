Let $D$ be a strongly connected directed graph of order $n\geq 4$ which
satisfies the following condition (*): for every pair of non-adjacent vertices
$x, y$ with a common in-neighbour $d(x)+d(y)\geq 2n-1$ and $min \{ d(x),
d(y)\}\geq n-1$. In \cite{[2]} (J. of Graph Theory 22 (2) (1996) 181-187)) J.
Bang-Jensen, G. Gutin and H. Li proved that $D$ is Hamiltonian. In [9] it was
shown that if $D$ satisfies the condition (*) and the minimum semi-degree of
$D$ at least two, then either $D$ contains a pre-Hamiltonian cycle (i.e., a
cycle of length $n-1$) or $n$ is even and $D$ is isomorphic to the complete
bipartite digraph (or to the complete bipartite digraph minus one arc) with
partite sets of cardinalities of $n/2$ and $n/2$. In this paper we show that if
the minimum out-degree of $D$ at least two and the minimum in-degree of $D$ at
least three, then $D$ contains also a Hamiltonian bypass, (i.e., a subdigraph
is obtained from a Hamiltonian cycle by reversing exactly one arc).
