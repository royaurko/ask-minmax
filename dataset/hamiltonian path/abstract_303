We present a new method for the numerical calculation of canonical reaction
rate constants in complex molecular systems, which is based on a path integral
formulation of the flux-flux correlation function. Central is the partitioning
of the total system into a relevant part coupled to a dual bath. The latter
consists of two parts: First, a set of strongly coupled harmonic modes,
describing, for example, intramolecular degrees of freedom. They are treated on
the basis of a reaction surface Hamiltonian approach. Second, a set of bath
modes mimicking an unspecific environment modeled by means of a continuous
spectral density. After deriving a set of general equations expressing the
canonical rate constant in terms of appropriate influence functionals, several
approximations are introduced to provide an efficient numerical implementation.
Results for an initial application to the H-transfer in
6-Aminofulvene-1-aldimine are discussed.
