Wilson lines in gauge theories admit several path integral descriptions. The
first one (due to Alekseev-Faddeev-Shatashvili) uses path integrals over
coadjoint orbits. The second one (due to Diakonov-Petrov) replaces a
1-dimensional path integral with a 2-dimensional topological $\sigma$-model. We
show that this $\sigma$-model is defined by the equivariant extension of the
Kirillov symplectic form on the coadjoint orbit. This allows to define the
corresponding observable on arbitrary 2-dimensional surfaces, including closed
surfaces. We give a new path integral presentation of Wilson lines in terms of
Poisson $\sigma$-models, and we test this presentation in the framework of the
2-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. On a closed surface, our Wilson surface
observable turns out to be nontrivial for $G$ non-simply connected (and trivial
for $G$ simply connected), in particular we study in detail the cases $G=U(1)$
and $G=SO(3)$.
