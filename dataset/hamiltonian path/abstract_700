We prove the integrability of the short pulse equation derived recently by
Sch\"afer and Wayne from a hamiltonian point of view. We give its
bi-hamiltonian structure and show how the recursion operator defined by the
hamiltonian operators is connected with the one obtained by Sakovich and
Sakovich. An alternative zero-curvature formulation is also given.
