A method for finding Berry's phase is proposed under the Euclidean path
integral formalism. It is characterized by picking up the imaginary part from
the resultant exponent. Discussion is made on the generalized harmonic
oscillator which is shown being so universal in a single degree case. The spin
model expressed by creation and annihilation operators is also discussed. A
systematic way of expansion in the adiabatic approximation is presented in
every example.
