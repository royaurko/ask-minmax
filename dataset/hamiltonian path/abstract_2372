This note is devoted to the study of Hamiltonian formalism of modified F(R)
Horava-Lifshitz theories of gravity that were proposed recently in
arXiv:1001.4102[hep-th]. We also study Hamiltonian formulation of the healthy
extended Horava-Lifshitz gravities and show that these theories have many
unusual and interesting properties.
