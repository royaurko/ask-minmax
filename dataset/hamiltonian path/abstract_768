This model is one of the possible geometrical interpretations of Quantum
Mechanics where found to every image Path correspondence the geodesic
trajectory of classical test particles in the random geometry of the stochastic
fields background. We are finding to the imagined Feynman Path a classical
model of test particles as geodesic trajectory in the curved space of Projected
Hilbert space on Bloch's sphere.
