A supersymmetric breaking procedure for $N=1$ Super KdV, using a Clifford
algebra, is implemented. Dirac's method for the determination of constraints is
used to obtain the Hamiltonian structure, via a Lagrangian, for the resulting
solitonic system of coupled Korteweg-de Vries type system. It is shown that the
Hamiltonian obtained by this procedure is bounded from below and in that sense
represents a model which is physically admissible.
