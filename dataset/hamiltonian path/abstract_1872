A classical Wilson line is a cooresponedce between closed paths and elemets
of a gauge group. However the noncommutative geometry does not have closed
paths. But noncommutative geometry have good generalizations of both: the
covering projection, and the group of covering transformations. These notions
are used for a construction of noncommutative Wilson lines. Wilson lines can
also be constructed as global pure gauge fields on the universal covering
space. The noncommutative analog of this construction is also developed.
