We apply the gradient approach to obtain a path over the sphaleron barrier
and to demonstrate the fermionic level crossing phenomenon. Neglecting the
mixing angle dependence and assuming that the fermions of a doublet are
degenerate in mass we employ spherically symmetric ans\"atze for the fields.
The gradient path over the barrier is smooth, even for large values of the
Higgs boson mass or of the fermion mass, where the extremal energy path
bifurcates.
