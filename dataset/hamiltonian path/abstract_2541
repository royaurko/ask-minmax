It is shown that from some solutions of generalized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
equations one can construct eigenfunctions of the Calogero-Sutherland-Moser
Hamiltonians with exchange terms, which are characterized by any given
permutational symmetry under particle exchange. This generalizes some results
previously derived by Matsuo and Cherednik for the ordinary
Calogero-Sutherland-Moser Hamiltonians.
