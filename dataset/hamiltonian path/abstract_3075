We present a method to secure the complete path between a server and the
local human user at a network node. This is useful for scenarios like internet
banking, electronic signatures, or online voting. Protection of input
authenticity and output integrity and authenticity is accomplished by a
combination of traditional and novel technologies, e.g., SSL, ActiveX, and
DirectX. Our approach does not require administrative privileges to deploy and
is hence suitable for consumer applications. Results are based on the
implementation of a proof-of-concept application for the Windows platform.
