In this paper, a symplectic and time-reversible integrator is proposed of
simulating the Hamiltonian dynamics with constraints in path integral molecular
dynamics. The constraints are tackled by Matrix Inverted Linearized Constraint
algorithm (MILC), while a slight modification is requested under normal mode
representation, and the slow force is mollified by Equilibrium method
(Equilibrium MOLLY) to ameliorate the numerical resonance. It is demonstrated
that the slow force impulse can be evaluated only at the centroid of beads,
instead of being evaluated at the positions of each bead independently.
Therefore, it not only allows longer time step but also reduces the complexity
of computation. The numerical experiment is performed using SPC/E model in 298K
with eight beads. Further discussion will involve the application of
Equilibrium MOLLY in flexible bond model.
