We consider a family of determinantal random point processes on the
two-dimensional lattice and prove that members of our family can be interpreted
as a kind of Gibbs ensembles of nonintersecting paths. Examples include
probability measures on lozenge and domino tilings of the plane, some of which
are non-translation-invariant.
  The correlation kernels of our processes can be viewed as extensions of the
discrete sine kernel, and we show that the Gibbs property is a consequence of
simple linear relations satisfied by these kernels. The processes depend on
infinitely many parameters, which are closely related to parametrization of
totally positive Toeplitz matrices.
