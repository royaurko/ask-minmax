Some elements of classical mechanics and classical statistical mechanics are
formulated in terms of fibre bundles. In the bundle approach the dynamical and
distribution functions are replaced by liftings of paths in a suitably chosen
bundle. Their time evolution is described by appropriate linear transports
along paths in it or, equivalently, by corresponding invariant bundle equations
of motion. In particular, the bundle version of the Liouville equation is
derived.
