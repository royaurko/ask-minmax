Hamilton-Jacobi approach for a constrained system is discussed. The equation
of motion for a singular systems are obtained as total differential equations
in many variables. The integrability conditions are investigated without using
any gauge fixing condition. The path integral quantization for systems with
finite degrees of freedom is applied to the field theories with constraints.
The Landau-Ginzburg theory is investigated in details.
