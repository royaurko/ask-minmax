The discrepancy of $0.8 %$ between theory and the COW-experiment is
interpreted. This is done by using a new path equation other than the geodesic
one. It is shown that this discrepancy is possibly due to a type of interaction
between the torsion, of space-time generated by the background field, and the
spin of the moving neutron. The results obtained are discussed and compared
with the experimental interpretation suggested by Arif et al. in 1994. As a
byproduct, an upper limit is imposed on the free parameter of the new path
equation used.
