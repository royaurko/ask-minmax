A path-integral approach to lattice polarons is developed. The method is
based on exact analytical elimination of phonons and subsequent Monte Carlo
simulation of self-interacting fermions. The analytical basis of the method is
presented with emphasis on visualization of polaron effects, which path
integrals provide. Numerical results on the polaron energy, mass, spectrum and
density of states are given for short-range and long-range electron-phonon
interactions. It is shown that certain long-range interactions significantly
reduce the polaron mass, and anisotropic interactions enhance polaron
anisotropy. The isotope effect on the polaron mass and spectrum is discussed. A
path-integral approach to the Jahn-Teller polaron is developed. Extensions of
the method to lattice bipolarons and to more complex polaron models are
outlined.
