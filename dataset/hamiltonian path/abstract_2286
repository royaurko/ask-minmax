Examples of non-standard construction of Hamiltonian structures for dynamical
systems and the respective Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equations, without using
Lagrangians, are presented. Alternative H-J equations for Euler top are
explicitly exhibited and solved. We demonstrate that some stability criterion,
relating the slope of a Casimir function parametrized by the Lagrange
multiplier to critical point type, depends on the used Hamiltonian structure
and it is inadequate for this reason.
