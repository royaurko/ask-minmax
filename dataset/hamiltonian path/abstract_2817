We develop a Hamiltonian theory of a time dispersive and dissipative
inhomogeneous medium, as described by a linear response equation respecting
causality and power dissipation. The proposed Hamiltonian couples the given
system to auxiliary fields, in the universal form of a so-called canonical heat
bath. After integrating out the heat bath the original dissipative evolution is
exactly reproduced. Furthermore, we show that the dynamics associated to a
minimal Hamiltonian are essentially unique, up to a natural class of
isomorphisms. Using this formalism, we obtain closed form expressions for the
energy density, energy flux, momentum density, and stress tensor involving the
auxiliary fields, from which we derive an approximate, ``Brillouin-type,''
formula for the time averaged energy density and stress tensor associated to an
almost mono-chromatic wave.
