For a particle moving in a one-dimensional space an under a periodic external
force, its quantization is study using the Hamiltonian (generalized linear
momentum quantization) and constant of motion (velocity quantization)
approaches. it is shown a great difference on the quantization of both
approaches and the ambiguities arisen by using the quantization on the
constants of motion.
