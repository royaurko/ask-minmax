CAT(0) metric spaces constitute a far-reaching common generalization of
Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces and simple polygons: any two points x and y of
a CAT(0) metric space are connected by a unique shortest path {\gamma}(x,y). In
this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for answering two-point distance
queries in CAT(0) rectangular complexes and two of theirs subclasses, ramified
rectilinear polygons (CAT(0) rectangular complexes in which the links of all
vertices are bipartite graphs) and squaregraphs (CAT(0) rectangular complexes
arising from plane quadrangulations in which all inner vertices have degrees
\geq4). Namely, we show that for a CAT(0) rectangular complex K with n
vertices, one can construct a data structure D of size $O(n^2)$ so that, given
any two points x,y in K, the shortest path {\gamma}(x,y) between x and y can be
computed in O(d(p,q)) time, where p and q are vertices of two faces of K
containing the points x and y, respectively, such that {\gamma}(x,y) is
contained in K(I(p,q)) and d(p,q) is the distance between p and q in the
underlying graph of K. If K is a ramified rectilinear polygon, then one can
construct a data structure D of optimal size O(n) and answer two-point shortest
path queries in O(d(p,q)log{\Delta}) time, where {\Delta} is the maximal degree
of a vertex of G(K). Finally, if K is a squaregraph, then one can construct a
data structure D of size O(nlogn) and answer two-point shortest path queries in
O(d(p,q)) time.
