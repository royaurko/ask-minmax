We present the first measurements of the attenuation of transverse sound in
superfluid 3He-B. We use fixed path length interferometry combined with the
magneto-acoustic Faraday effect to vary the effective path length by a factor
of two, resulting in absolute values of the attenuation. We find that
attenuation is significantly larger than expected from the theoretical
dispersion relation, in contrast to the phase velocity of transverse sound. We
suggest that the anomalous attenuation can be explained by surface Andreev
bound states.
