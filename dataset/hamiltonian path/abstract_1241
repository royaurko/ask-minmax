We present three algorithms for calculating rate constants and sampling
transition paths for rare events in simulations with stochastic dynamics. The
methods do not require a priori knowledge of the phase space density and are
suitable for equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems in stationary state. All
the methods use a series of interfaces in phase space, between the initial and
final states, to generate transition paths as chains of connected partial
paths, in a ratchet-like manner. No assumptions are made about the distribution
of paths at the interfaces. The three methods differ in the way that the
transition path ensemble is generated. We apply the algorithms to kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations of a genetic switch and to Langevin Dynamics simulations of
intermittently driven polymer translocation through a pore. We find that the
three methods are all of comparable efficiency, and that all the methods are
much more efficient than brute force simulation.
