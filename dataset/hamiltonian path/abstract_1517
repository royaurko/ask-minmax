The ground state energy and pairing gap of the interacting Fermi gases
calculated by the {\it ab initio} stochastic method are compared with those
estimated from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing Hamiltonian. We discuss
the ingredients of this Hamiltonian in various regimes of interaction strength.
In the weakly interacting ($1/ak_F <<0$) regime the BCS Hamiltonian should
describe Landau quasi-particle energies and interactions, on the other hand in
the strongly pairing regime, that is $1/ak_F \gtrsim 0$, it becomes part of the
bare Hamiltonian. However, the bare BCS Hamiltonian is not adequate for
describing atomic gases in the regime of weak to moderate interaction strength
$-\infty < 1/ak_F <0$ such as $ak_F \sim -1$.
