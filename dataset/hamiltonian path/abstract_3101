A proposal for the path-integral of pure-spin-connection formulation of
gravity is described, based on the two-form formulation of Capovilla et. al. It
is shown that the resulting effective-action for the spin-connection, upon
functional integration of the two-form field $\Sigma$ and the auxiliary matrix
field $\psi$ is {\it non-polynomial}, even for the case of vanishing
cosmological constant and absence of any matter couplings. Further, a
diagramatic evaluation is proposed for the contribution of the matrix-field to
the pure spin connection action.
