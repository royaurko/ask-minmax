It is known that a number of natural graph problems which are FPT
parameterized by treewidth become W-hard when parameterized by clique-width. It
is therefore desirable to find a different structural graph parameter which is
as general as possible, covers dense graphs but does not incur such a heavy
algorithmic penalty.
  The main contribution of this paper is to consider a parameter called
modular-width, defined using the well-known notion of modular decompositions.
Using a combination of ILPs and dynamic programming we manage to design FPT
algorithms for Coloring and Partitioning into paths (and hence Hamiltonian path
and Hamiltonian cycle), which are W-hard for both clique-width and its recently
introduced restriction, shrub-depth. We thus argue that modular-width occupies
a sweet spot as a graph parameter, generalizing several simpler notions on
dense graphs but still evading the "price of generality" paid by clique-width.
