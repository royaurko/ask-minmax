A weighted graph is a graph in which every edge is assigned a non-negative
real number. In a weighted graph, the weight of a path is the sum of the
weights of its edges, and the weighed degree of a vertex is the sum of the
weights of the edges incident with it. In this paper we give three weighted
degree conditions for the existence of heavy or Hamilton paths with one or two
given end-vertices in 2-connected weighted graphs.
