In this paper I develop a new computational method for pricing path dependent
options. Using the path integral representation of the option price, I show
that in general it is possible to perform analytically a partial averaging over
the underlying risk-neutral diffusion process. This result greatly eases the
computational burden placed on the subsequent numerical evaluation. For
short-medium term options it leads to a general approximation formula that only
requires the evaluation of a one dimensional integral. I illustrate the
application of the method to Asian options and occupation time derivatives.
