A numerical study of low-lying glueball masses of compact U(1) lattice gauge
theory in (2+1) dimensions is performed using Standard Path integral Monte
Carlo techniques. The masses are extracted, at fixed (low) temperature, from
simulations on anisotropic lattices, with temporal lattice spacing much smaller
than the spatial ones. Convincing evidence of the scaling behaviour in the
antisymmetric mass gap is observed over the range $1.4<\beta <2.25$. The
observed behaviour is very consistent with asymptotic form predicted by G{\"
o}pfert and Mack. Extrapolations are made to the "Hamiltonian" limit, and the
results are compared with previous estimates obtained by many other Hamiltonian
studies.
