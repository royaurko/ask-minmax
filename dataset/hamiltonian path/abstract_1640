In this paper we give a detailed description of the random wavelet series
representation of real-valued linear fractional stable sheet introduced in
Ayache, Roueff and Xiao (2007). By using this representation, in the case where
the sample paths are continuous, an anisotropic uniform and quasi-optimal
modulus of continuity of these paths is obtained as well as an upper bound for
their behavior at infinity and around the coordinate axes. The Hausdorff
dimensions of the range and graph of these stable random fields are then
derived.
