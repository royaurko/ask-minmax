I propose an alternative Hamiltonian field theoretical model for a light
quark condensate that is compatible with QCD in the deep infrared. Key
electroweak data on flavourless pseudoscalar mesons are used for necessary
renormalizations. Light quark inertial masses are redifined in a new and
broader theoretical context.
