In his celebrated book "On Number and Games" (Academic Press, New-York,
1976), J.H. Conway introduced twelve versions of compound games. We analyze
these twelve versions for the Node-Kayles game on paths. For usual disjunctive
compound, Node-Kayles has been solved for a long time under normal play, while
it is still unsolved under mis\`ere play. We thus focus on the ten remaining
versions, leaving only one of them unsolved.
