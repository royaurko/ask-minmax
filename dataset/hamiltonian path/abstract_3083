Previous analysis about the deparametrization and path integral quantization
of cosmological models are extended to models which do not admit an intrinsic
time. The formal expression for the transition amplitude is written down for
the Taub anisotropic universe with a clear notion of time. The relation
existing between the deparametrization associated to gauge fixation required in
the path integral approach and the procedure of reduction of the Wheeler-De
Witt equation is also studied.
