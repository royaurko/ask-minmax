A one-to-one correspondence is known to exist between the spectra of the
discrete states of the non Hermitian Swanson-type Hamiltonian $ H =
{\cal{A}}^{\dagger} {\cal{A}} + \alpha {\cal{A}} ^2 + \beta {\cal{A}}^{\dagger
2} $, ($\alpha \neq \beta $), and an equivalent Hermitian Schr\"{o}dinger
Hamiltonian $h$, the two Hamiltonians being related through a similarity
transformation. In this work we consider the continuum states of $h$, and
examine the nature of the corresponding states of $H$.
