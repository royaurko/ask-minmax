We study the center of several types of path algebras. We start with the path
algebra $KE$ and prove that if the number of vertices is infinite then the
center is zero. Otherwise, it coincides with the field $K$ except when the
graph $E$ is a cycle in which case the center is $K[x]$, the polynomial algebra
in one indeterminate. Then we compute the centers of prime Cohn and Leavitt
path algebras. A lower and an upper bound for the center of a Leavitt path
algebra are given by introducing the graded Baer radical for graded algebras.
