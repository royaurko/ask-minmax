Two classical sources of imprecision in static analysis by abstract
interpretation are widening and merge operations. Merge operations can be done
away by distinguishing paths, as in trace partitioning, at the expense of
enumerating an exponential number of paths. In this article, we describe how to
avoid such systematic exploration by focusing on a single path at a time,
designated by SMT-solving. Our method combines well with acceleration
techniques, thus doing away with widenings as well in some cases. We illustrate
it over the well-known domain of convex polyhedra.
