A Hamiltonian defined as a polynomial in creation and annihilation operators
is considered. After a minimization of its expectation value over pure Gaussian
states, the Hamiltonian is Wick-ordered in creation and annihillation operators
adapted to the minimizing state. It is shown that this procedure eliminates
from the Hamiltonian terms of degree 1 and 2 that do not preserve the particle
number, and leaves only terms that can be interpreted as quasiparticles
excitations. We propose to call this fact Beliaev's Theorem, since to our
knowledge it was mentioned for the first time in a paper by Beliaev from 1959.
