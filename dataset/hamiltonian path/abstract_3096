Based on the closed time path formalism, a new Feynman rule for directly
calculating the retarded and advanced Green functions is deduced. This Feynman
rule is used to calculate the two-point self-energy and three-point vertex
correction in $\phi^3$ theory. The generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem
for three-point nonlinear response function is verified.
