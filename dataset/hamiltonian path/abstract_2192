We present PIE, a scalable routing scheme that achieves 100% packet delivery
and low path stretch. It is easy to implement in a distributed fashion and
works well when costs are associated to links. Scalability is achieved by using
virtual coordinates in a space of concise dimensionality, which enables greedy
routing based only on local knowledge. PIE is a general routing scheme, meaning
that it works on any graph. We focus however on the Internet, where routing
scalability is an urgent concern. We show analytically and by using simulation
that the scheme scales extremely well on Internet-like graphs. In addition, its
geometric nature allows it to react efficiently to topological changes or
failures by finding new paths in the network at no cost, yielding better
delivery ratios than standard algorithms. The proposed routing scheme needs an
amount of memory polylogarithmic in the size of the network and requires only
local communication between the nodes. Although each node constructs its
coordinates and routes packets locally, the path stretch remains extremely low,
even lower than for centralized or less scalable state-of-the-art algorithms:
PIE always finds short paths and often enough finds the shortest paths.
