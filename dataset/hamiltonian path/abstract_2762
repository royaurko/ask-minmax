The renormalization of the effective QCD-Hamiltonian theory for the
quark-antiquark channel is performed in terms of a renormalized or fixed-point
Hamiltonian that leads to subtracted dynamical equations. The fixed
point-Hamiltonian brings the renormalization conditions as well as the
counterterms that render the theory finite. The approach is renormalization
group invariant. The parameters of the renormalized effective QCD-Hamiltonian
comes from the pion mass and radius, for a given constituent quark mass. The 1s
and excited 2s states of $\bar u q$ are calculated as a function of the mass of
the quark $q$ being s, c or b, and compared to the experimental values.
