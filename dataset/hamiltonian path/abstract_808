We consider symmetries and perturbed symmetries of canonical Hamiltonian
equations of motion. Specifically we consider the case in which the Hamiltonian
equations exhibit a Lambda symmetry under some Lie point vector field. After a
brief survey of the relationships between standard symmetries and the existence
of first integrals, we recall the definition and the properties of Lambda
symmetries. We show that in the presence of a Lambda symmetry for the
Hamiltonian equations, one can introduce the notion of "Lambda-constant of
motion". The presence of a Lambda symmetry leads also to a nice and useful
reduction of the form of the equations. We then consider the case in which the
Hamiltonian problem is deduced from a Lambda-invariant Lagrangian. We
illustrate how the Lagrangian Lambda-invariance is transferred into the
Hamiltonian context and show that the Hamiltonian equations are
Lambda-symmetric. We also compare the "partial" (Lagrangian) reduction of the
Euler-Lagrange equations with the reduction which can be obtained for the
Hamiltonian equations. Several examples illustrate and clarify the various
situations.
