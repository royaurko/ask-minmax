We provide a symplectic reduction of a partially integrable Hamiltonian
system to a completely integrable one. The KAM theorem is applied to this
reduced completely integrable Hamiltonian system. Its KAM perturbation
generates a perturbation of the original partially integrable system such that
the set of tori kept by this perturbation is large.
