Applications of the Path Group (consisting of classes of continuous curves in
Minkowski space-time) to gauge theory and gravity are reviewed. Covariant
derivatives are interpreted as generators of an induced representation of Path
Group. Non-Abelian generalization of Stokes theorem is naturally formulated and
proved in terms of paths. Quantum analogue of Equivalence Principle is
formulated in terms of Path Group and Feynman path integrals.
