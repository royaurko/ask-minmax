Magnetic moments of charged and neutral mesons are calculated with the use of
the relativistic Hamiltonian derived from the path integral form of the
$q_1\bar q_2$ Green's function. The magnetic moments are shown to be expressed
via the average quark energies which are defined by the fundamental quantities:
the string tension $\sigma$, the current quark masses, and the strong coupling
constant $\alpha_s$. Resulting values for vector, axial, and tensor light and
$K$ mesons agree well with all available lattice data.
