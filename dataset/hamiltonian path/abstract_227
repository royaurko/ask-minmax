Classical Hamiltonian spin systems are continuous dynamical systems on the
symplectic phase space $(S^2)^n$. In this paper we investigate the underlying
geometry of a time discretization scheme for classical Hamiltonian spin systems
called the spherical midpoint method. As it turns out, this method displays a
range of interesting geometrical features, that yield insights and sets out
general strategies for geometric time discretizations of Hamiltonian systems on
non-canonical symplectic manifolds. In particular, our study provides two new,
completely geometric proofs that the discrete-time spin systems obtained by the
spherical midpoint method preserve symplecticity.
  The study follows two paths. First, we introduce an extended version of the
Hopf fibration to show that the spherical midpoint method can be seen as
originating from the classical midpoint method on $T^*\mathbf{R}^{2n}$ for a
collective Hamiltonian. Symplecticity is then a direct, geometric consequence.
Second, we propose a new discretization scheme on Riemannian manifolds called
the Riemannian midpoint method. We determine its properties with respect to
isometries and Riemannian submersions and, as a special case, we show that the
spherical midpoint method is of this type for a non-Euclidean metric. In
combination with K\"ahler geometry, this provides another geometric proof of
symplecticity.
