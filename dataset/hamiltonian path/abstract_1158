We consider a fractional generalization of Hamiltonian and gradient systems.
We use differential forms and exterior derivatives of fractional orders. We
derive fractional generalization of Helmholtz conditions for phase space.
Examples of fractional gradient and Hamiltonian systems are considered. The
stationary states for these systems are derived.
