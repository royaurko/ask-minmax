A manifestly covariant expression for the current matrix elements of three
quark bound systems is derived in the framework of the Point Form Relativistic
Hamiltonian Dynamics. The relativistic impulse approximation is assumed in the
model. A critical comparison is made with other expressions usually given in
the literature.
