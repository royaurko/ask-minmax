We construct integrable models on flag manifold by using the symplectic
structure explicitly given in the Bruhat coordinatization of flag manifold.
They are non-commutative integrable and some of the conserved quantities are
given by the Casimir invariants. We quantize the systems using the coherent
state path integral technique and find the exact expression for the propagator
for some special cases.
