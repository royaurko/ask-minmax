Minimization of computational errors in the fixed-point data path is often
difficult task. Many signal processing algorithms use chains of consecutive
additions. The analyzing technique that can be applied to fixed-point data path
synthesis has been proposed. This technique takes advantage of allocating the
chains of consecutive additions in order to predict growing width of the data
path and minimize the design complexity and computational errors.
