Quantum mechanical phase space path integrals are re-examined with regard to
the physical interpretation of the phase space variables involved. It is
demonstrated that the traditional phase space path integral implies a meaning
for the variables involved that is manifestly inconsistent. On the other hand,
a phase space path integral based on coherent states entails variables that
exhibit a self-consistent physical meaning.
