We discuss the design, construction, and use of a new class of scanning
camera that eliminates a critical limitation of standard CCD drift-scan
observations. A standard scan, which involves no correction for the
differential drift rates and curved stellar paths across the field-of-view,
suffers from severe image degradation even when one observes at moderate
declinations. Not only does this effect limit the area of the sky over which
drift scanning is viable, but as detector sizes increase, CCD mosaics become
standard, and dome/telescope seeing improves, the area of sky for which
scanning is acceptable (image degradation $\ltsim$ seeing) will be further
reduced unless some action is taken. By modifying the scan path (the path on
the sky traced by signal accumulated along a single CCD column) to lie along a
great circle on the sky rather than along a path of constant declination, image
degradation is minimized. In this paper, we discuss the design and
implementation of a stage that rotates and translates the CCD during a
drift-scan exposure so that the scan path is along a great circle on the sky.
Data obtained during the commissioning run of the Great Circle Camera at the
Las Campanas 1-m telescope are presented.
