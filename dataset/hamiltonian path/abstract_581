We present a calculation of the weak localisation correction to the
scattering and to the transport mean free path, for waves propagating in a
$delta$-correlated random potential, going beyond the usual diffusion
approximation for the loops in the interfering path amplitudes. We find that
not only the transport mean free path, but also the scattering mean free path
is affected by the interference contributions. We also find the dependence of
the leading order contribution to both, the scattering and the transport mean
free path, on the disorder parameter $1/kl$ to be linear. This is in contrast
to the result obtained from the diffusion approximation according to which the
scattering mean free path remains unaffected when changing the disorder
parameter, whereas the correction of the transport mean free path scales like
$1/(kl)^2$.
