This paper addresses the issue of structure-preserving discretization of open
distributed-parameter systems with Hamiltonian dynamics. Employing the
formalism of discrete exterior calculus, we introduce a simplicial Dirac
structure as a discrete analogue of the Stokes-Dirac structure and demonstrate
that it provides a natural framework for deriving finite-dimensional
port-Hamiltonian systems that emulate their infinite-dimensional counterparts.
The spatial domain, in the continuous theory represented by a
finite-dimensional smooth manifold with boundary, is replaced by a homological
manifold-like simplicial complex and its augmented circumcentric dual. The
smooth differential forms, in discrete setting, are mirrored by cochains on the
primal and dual complexes, while the discrete exterior derivative is defined to
be the coboundary operator. This approach of discrete differential geometry,
rather than discretizing the partial differential equations, allows to first
discretize the underlying Stokes-Dirac structure and then to impose the
corresponding finite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian dynamics. In this manner, a
number of important intrinsically topological and geometrical properties of the
system are preserved.
