We investigate the three dimensional Georgi-Glashow model with a Chern-Simons
term. We find that there exist complex monopole solutions of finite action.
They dominate the path integral and disorder the Higgs vacuum, but electric
charges are not confined. Subtleties in the gauge fixing procedure in the path
integral and issues related to Gribov copies are noted.
