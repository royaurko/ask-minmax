This contribution proposes a method to make agents in a microscopic
simulation of pedestrian traffic walk approximately along a path of estimated
minimal remaining travel time to their destination. Usually models of
pedestrian dynamics are (implicitly) built on the assumption that pedestrians
walk along the shortest path. Model elements formulated to make pedestrians
locally avoid collisions and intrusion into personal space do not produce
motion on quickest paths. Therefore a special model element is needed, if one
wants to model and simulate pedestrians for whom travel time matters most (e.g.
travelers in a station hall who are late for a train). Here such a model
element is proposed, discussed and used within the Social Force Model.
