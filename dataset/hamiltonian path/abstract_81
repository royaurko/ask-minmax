The equivalence from the point of view of the Hamiltonian path integral
quantization between a higher derivative extension of Maxwell-Chern-Simons
Proca model and some gauge invariant theories is investigated in the framework
of gauge unfixing approach. The Hamiltonian path integrals of the first-class
systems take manifestly Lorentz-covariant forms.
