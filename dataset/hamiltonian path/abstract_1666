Given a C^1 path of systems of homogeneous polynomial equations f_t, t in
[a,b] and an approximation x_a to a zero zeta_a of the initial system f_a, we
show how to adaptively choose the step size for a Newton based homotopy method
so that we approximate the lifted path (f_t,zeta_t) in the space of (problems,
solutions) pairs.
  The total number of Newton iterations is bounded in terms of the length of
the lifted path in the condition metric.
