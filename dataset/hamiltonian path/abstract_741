The free energy profile of a reaction can be estimated in a
molecular-dynamics approach by imposing a mechanical constraint along a
reaction coordinate (RC). Many recent studies have shown that the temperature
can greatly influence the path followed by the reactants. Here, we propose a
practical way to construct the minimum energy path directly on the free energy
surface (FES) at a given temperature. First, we follow the blue-moon ensemble
method to derive the expression of the free energy gradient for a given RC.
These derivatives are then used to find the actual minimum energy reaction path
at finite temperature, in a way similar to the Intrinsic Reaction Path of Fukui
on the potential energy surface [K Fukui J. Phys. Chem. 74, 4161 (1970)]. Once
the path is know, one can calculate the free energy profile using thermodynamic
integration. We also show that the mass-metric correction cancels for many
types of constraints, making the procedure easy to use. Finally, the minimum
free energy path at 300 K for the addition of the 1,1'-dichlorocarbene to
ethylene is compared with a path based on a simple one-dimensional reaction
coordinate. A comparison is also given with the reaction path at 0 K.
