We present the LHC predictions for the WHDG model of radiative, elastic, and
path length fluctuating energy loss. We find the pT dependence of RAA is
qualitatively very different from AWS-based energy loss extrapolations to the
LHC; the large pT reach of the year one data at the LHC should suffice to
distinguish between the two. We also discuss the importance of requiring a
first elastic scatter before any medium-induced elastic or radiative loss
occurs, a necessary physical effect not considered in any previous models.
