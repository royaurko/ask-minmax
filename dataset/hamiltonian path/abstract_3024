We discuss two numerical methods, based on a path integral approach described
in a previous paper (I), for solving the stochastic equations underlying the
financial markets: the Monte Carlo approach, and the Green function
deterministic numerical method. Then, we apply the latter to some specific
financial problems. In particular, we consider the pricing of a European
option, a zero-coupon bond, a caplet, an American option, and a Bermudan
swaption.
