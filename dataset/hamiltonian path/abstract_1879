In this paper, we prove that every planar graph has a 1-string $B_2$-VPG
representation---a string representation using paths in a rectangular grid that
contain at most two bends. Furthermore, two paths representing vertices $u,v$
intersect precisely once whenever there is an edge between $u$ and $v$.
