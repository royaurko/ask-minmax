A classic theorem of Dirac from 1952 states that every graph with minimum
degree at least n/2 contains a Hamiltonian cycle. In 1963, P\'osa conjectured
that every graph with minimum degree at least 2n/3 contains the square of a
Hamiltonian cycle. In 1960, Ore relaxed the degree condition in the Dirac's
theorem by proving that every graph with $deg(u) + deg(v) \geq n$ for every $uv
\notin E(G)$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle. Recently, Ch\^au proved an Ore-type
version of P\'osa's conjecture for graphs on $n\geq n_0$ vertices using the
regularity--blow-up method; consequently the $n_0$ is very large (involving a
tower function). Here we present another proof that avoids the use of the
regularity lemma. Aside from the fact that our proof holds for much smaller
$n_0$, we believe that our method of proof will be of independent interest.
