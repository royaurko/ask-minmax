In the paper we investigate the evolution of the relativistic particle
(massive and massless) with spin defined by Hamiltonian containing the terms
with momentum-spin-orbit coupling. We integrate the corresponding Hamiltonian
equations in quadratures and express their solutions in terms of elliptic
functions.
