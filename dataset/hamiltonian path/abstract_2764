The long standing problem of non perturbative renormalization of a gauge
field theoretical Hamiltonian is addressed and explicitly carried out within an
(effective) light-cone Hamiltonian approach to QCD. The procedure is in line
with the conventional ideas: The Hamiltonian is first regulated by suitable
cut-off functions, and subsequently renormalized by suitable counter terms to
make it cut-off independent. Emphasized is the considerable freedom in the
cut-off function which eventually can modify the Coulomb potential of two
charges at sufficiently small distances. The approach provides new physical
insight into nature of gauge theory and the potential energy of QCD and QED
near the origin. The so obtained formalism is applied to physical mesons with a
different flavor of quark and anti-quark. The excitation spectrum of the
$\rho$-meson with its excellent agreement between theory and experiment is
discussed as a pedagogical example.
