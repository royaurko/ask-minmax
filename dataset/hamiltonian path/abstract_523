We study pathwise invariances of centred random fields that can be controlled
through the covariance. A result involving composition operators is obtained in
second-order settings, and we show that various path properties including
additivity boil down to invariances of the covariance kernel. These results are
extended to a broader class of operators in the Gaussian case, via the Lo\`eve
isometry. Several covariance-driven pathwise invariances are illustrated,
including fields with symmetric paths, centred paths, harmonic paths, or sparse
paths. The proposed approach delivers a number of promising results and
perspectives in Gaussian process regression.
