We classify all bifurcations from traveling waves to non-trivial
time-periodic solutions of the Benjamin-Ono equation that are predicted by
linearization. We use a spectrally accurate numerical continuation method to
study several paths of non-trivial solutions beyond the realm of linear theory.
These paths are found to either re-connect with a different traveling wave or
to blow up. In the latter case, as the bifurcation parameter approaches a
critical value, the amplitude of the initial condition grows without bound and
the period approaches zero. We then prove a theorem that gives the mapping from
one bifurcation to its counterpart on the other side of the path and exhibits
exact formulas for the time-periodic solutions on this path. The Fourier
coefficients of these solutions are power sums of a finite number of particle
positions whose elementary symmetric functions execute simple orbits (circles
or epicycles) in the unit disk of the complex plane. We also find examples of
interior bifurcations from these paths of already non-trivial solutions, but we
do not attempt to analyze their analytic structure.
