In this study, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian theories, which are mathematical
models of mechanical systems, are structured on the horizontal and the vertical
distributions of tangent and cotangent bundles. In the end, the geometrical and
physical results related to Hamiltonian and Lagrangian dynamical systems are
concluded.
