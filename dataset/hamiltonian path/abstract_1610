We extend the conductance and canonical paths methods to the setting of
general finite Markov chains, including non-reversible non-lazy walks. The new
path method is used to show that a known bound for mixing time of a lazy walk
on a Cayley graph with symmetric generating set also applies to the non-lazy
non-symmetric case, often even when there is no holding probability.
