This note shows there are infinitely many finite groups G, such that every
connected Cayley graph on G has a hamiltonian cycle, and G is not solvable.
Specifically, for every prime p that is congruent to 1, modulo 30, we show
there is a hamiltonian cycle in every connected Cayley graph on the direct
product of the cyclic group of order p with the alternating group A_5 on five
letters.
