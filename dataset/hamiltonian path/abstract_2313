The dynamical algebra of the q-deformed harmonic oscillator is constructed. As
a result, we find the free deformed Hamiltonian as well as the Hamiltonian of
the deformed oscillator as a complicated, momentum dependent interaction
Hamiltonian in terms of the usual canonical variables. Furthermore we
construct a well-defined algebra SU$_q$(1,1) with consistent conjugation
properties and comultiplication. We obtain non lowest weight representations of
this algebra.
