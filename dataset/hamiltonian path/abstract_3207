We present high-resolution path-integral calculations of a previously
developed model of short-term memory in neocortex. These calculations, made
possible with supercomputer resources, supplant similar calculations made in L.
Ingber, Phys. Rev. E 49, 4652 (1994), and support coarser estimates made in L.
Ingber, Phys. Rev. A 29, 3346 (1984). We also present a current experimental
context for the relevance of these calculations using the approach of
statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions, especially in the context of
electroencephalographic data.
