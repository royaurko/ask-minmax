Hamiltonian lattice QCD with Wilson fermions is investigated systematically
by strong-coupling expansion up to the second order. The effective Hamiltonian
is diagonalized by Bogoliubov transformation. The vacuum energy, chiral
condensate, pseudo-scalar and vector meson masses are calculated. The
comparison with the unitary transformation method by Luo and Chen is also made.
The method discussed in this paper has potential application to QCD at finite
density.
