We use a recently developed action principle in spaces with curvature and
torsion to derive the Euler equations of motion for a rigid body within the
body-fixed coordinate system. This serves as an example that the particle
trajectories in a space with curvature and torsion follow the straightest paths
(autoparallels), not the shortest paths (geodesics), as commonly believed.
