Based on a generalization of the stochastic quantization scheme we recently
proposed a generalized, globally defined Faddeev-Popov path integral density
for the quantization of Yang-Mills theory. In this talk first our approach on
the whole space of gauge potentials is shortly reviewed; in the following we
discuss the corresponding global path integral on the gauge orbit space
relating it to the original Parisi-Wu stochastic quantization scheme.
