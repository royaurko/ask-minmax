We study the quantization of three-dimensional many-body systems in rotating
coordinate frames defined implicitly by frame conditions. We carry out the
elimination of orientational degrees of freedom in general, giving the
Hamiltonian for the $N$-particle system in a broad class of body frames in
terms of frame conditions and internal coordinates. We obtain several forms for
the kinetic energy operator and compare them to related expressions in the
literature.
