We construct path integral representations for the evolution operator of
q-oscillators with root of unity values of q-parameter using Bargmann-Fock
representations with commuting and non-commuting variables, the differential
calculi being q-deformed in both cases. For $q^2=-1$ we obtain a new form of
Grassmann-like path integral.
