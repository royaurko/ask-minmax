In World Line Path Integral representation Abelian Higgs theories admit a
curvature term in the Hamiltonian. Using Monte Carlo simulations we show that
the curvature term drives a phase transition at sufficiently strong coupling.
In quenched approximation this phase transition is smooth, with implications
that the model reduces to a Goldstone theory. Critical properties of the system
near the transition are investigated and found to be consistent with mean field
behavior.
