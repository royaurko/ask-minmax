In this paper, we first prove a geometric Hamilton-Jacobi theorem for
Hamiltonian system on the cotangent bundle of a configuration manifold, by
using the symplectic structure and dynamical vector field, under a weaker
condition. Then we generalize the result to regular reducible Hamiltonian
system with symmetry by using the reduced symplectic structure and reduced
dynamical vector field, and obtain the Hamilton-Jacobi theorems for regular
point reduced Hamiltonian system and regular orbit reduced Hamiltonian system.
As an application of the theoretical results, we consider the regular point
reducible Hamiltonian system on a Lie group, and give the Hamilton-Jacobi
theorem and Lie-Poisson Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the system. In particular,
we show the Lie-Poisson Hamilton-Jacobi equations of rigid body and heavy top
on the rotation group SO(3) and on the Euclidean group SE(3), respectively.
