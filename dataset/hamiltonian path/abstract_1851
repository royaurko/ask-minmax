The solution to the fractional Schr\"odinger equation with infinite square
well is obtained in this paper, by use of the L\'evy path integral approach. We
obtain the even and odd parity wave functions of this problem, which are in
accordance with those given by Laskin in [Chaos 10 (2000), 780--790].
