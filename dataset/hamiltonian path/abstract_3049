Recent progress in the development of efficient computational algorithms to
price financial derivatives is summarized. A first algorithm is based on a path
integral approach to option pricing, while a second algorithm makes use of a
neural network parameterization of option prices. The accuracy of the two
methods is established from comparisons with the results of the standard
procedures used in quantitative finance.
