We derive a model Hamiltonian whose ground state expectation value of any
two-body operator coincides with that obtained with the Jastrow correlated wave
function of the many-body Fermi system. Using this Hamiltonian we show that the
variational principle can be extended to treat systems with dynamical mesons,
even if in this case the concept of wave function looses its meaning.
