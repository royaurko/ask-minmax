Following Huse and Rutenberg [Phys. Rev. B 45, 7536 (1992)], I argue the
classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagom\'e lattice has long-range
spin order of the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ type (modulo gradual orientation
fluctuations of the spins' plane). I start from the effective quartic
Hamiltonian for the soft (out of plane) spin fluctuation modes, and treat as a
perturbation those terms which depend on the discrete coplanar state. Soft mode
correlations, which become the coefficients of a discrete effective
Hamiltonian, are estimated analytically.
