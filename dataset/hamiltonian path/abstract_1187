We establish the general form of effective interacting Hamiltonian for
LaOFeAs system based on the symmetry consideration. The peculiar symmetry
property of the electron states yields unusual form of electron-electron
interaction. Based on the general effective Hamiltonian, we determine all the
ten possible pairing states. More physical considerations would further reduce
the list of the candidates for the pairing state.
