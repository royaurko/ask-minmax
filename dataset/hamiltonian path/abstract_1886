We define the Khovanov-Rozansky homology for arbitrary directed graphs and
prove that it detects directed cycles and paths. We show that Krull dimensions
of the 0-th Khovanov-Rozansky homology provide upper bounds for the numbers of
edge-disjoint directed cycles and paths. Moreover, we observe that the
homogeneous part of degree 1 of the 0-th Khovanov-Rozansky homology detects
undirected cycles and is closely related to the vertex-edge incidence matrix.
