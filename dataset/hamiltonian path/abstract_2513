We study a dynamical system with time dependent Hamiltonian by numerical
experiments so as to find a relation between thermodynamics and chaotic nature
of the system. Excess information loss, defined newly based on Lyapunov
analysis, is related to the increment of thermodynamic entropy. Our numerical
results suggest that the positivity of entropy increment is expressed by the
principle of the minimum excess information loss.
