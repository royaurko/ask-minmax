When physical systems are tunable by three classical parameters, level
degeneracies may occur at isolated points in parameter space. A topological
singularity in the phase of the degenerate eigenvectors exists at these points.
When a path encloses such point, the accumulated geometrical phase is sensitive
to its presence. Furthermore, surfaces in parameter space enclosing such point
can be used to characterize the eigenvector singularities through their Chern
indices, which are integers. They can be used to quantize a physical quantity
of interest. This quantity changes continuously during an adiabatic evolution
along a path in parameter space. Quantization requires to turn this path into a
surface with a well defined Chern index. We analyze the conditions necessary to
a {\em Topological Quantization by Controlled Paths}. It is applied to Cooper
pair pumps. For more general problems, a set of four criteria are proposed to
check if topological quantization is possible.
