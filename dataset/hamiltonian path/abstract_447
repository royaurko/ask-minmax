Zero forcing number has recently become an interesting graph parameter
studied in its own right since its introduction by the "AIM Minimum Rank --
Special Graphs Work Group", whereas metric dimension is a well-known graph
parameter. We investigate the metric dimension and the zero forcing number of
some line graphs by first determining the metric dimension and the zero forcing
number of the line graphs of wheel graphs and the bouquet of circles. We prove
that $Z(G) \le 2Z(L(G))$ for a simple and connected graph $G$. Further, we show
that $Z(G) \le Z(L(G))$ when $G$ is a tree or when $G$ contains a Hamiltonian
path and has a certain number of edges. We compare the metric dimension with
the zero forcing number of a line graph by demonstrating a couple of
inequalities between the two parameters. We end by stating some open problems.
