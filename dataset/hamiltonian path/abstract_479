We construct a path distribution representing the kinetic part of the Feynman
path integral at discrete times similar to that defined by Thomas [1], but on a
Hilbert space of paths rather than a nuclear sequence space. We also consider
different boundary conditions and show that the discrete-time Feynman path
integral is well-defined for suitably smooth potentials.
