On any closed symplectic manifold we construct a path-connected neighborhood
of the identity in the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group with the property that
each Hamiltonian diffeomorphism in this neighborhood admits a Hofer and
spectral length minimizing path to the identity. This neighborhood is open in
the $C^1-$topology. The construction utilizes a continuation argument and chain
level result in the Floer theory of Lagrangian intersections.
