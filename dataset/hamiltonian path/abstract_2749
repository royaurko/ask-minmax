This work closes certain gaps in the literature on material reference systems
in general relativity. It is shown that perfect fluids are a special case of
DeWitt's relativistic elastic media and that the velocity--potential formalism
for perfect fluids can be interpreted as describing a perfect fluid coupled to
a fleet of clocks. A Hamiltonian analysis of the elastic media with clocks is
carried out and the constraints that arise when the system is coupled to
gravity are studied. When the Hamiltonian constraint is resolved with respect
to the clock momentum, the resulting true Hamiltonian is found to be a
functional only of the gravitational variables. The true Hamiltonian is
explicitly displayed when the medium is dust, and is shown to depend on the
detailed construction of the clocks.
