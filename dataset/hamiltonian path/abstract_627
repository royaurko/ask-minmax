Experiments are conducted to study the path and shape of single air bubbles
(diameter range 0.10- 0.20cm) rising freely in clean water. The experimental
results demonstrate that the bubble shape has a bistable state, i. e. the
bubble chooses to be in spherical or ellipsoidal shape depending on its
generation mechanism. The path of a spherical/ellipsoidal bubble is found to
change from a straight path to a zigzag/spiral path via a
supercritical/subcritical bifurcation when the Reynolds number of the bubble
exceeds a threshold.
