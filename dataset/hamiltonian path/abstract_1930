We exhibit a bijection between 132-avoiding permutations and Dyck paths.
Using this bijection, it is shown that all the recently discovered results on
generating functions for 132-avoiding permutations with a given number of
occurrences of the pattern $12... k$ follow directly from old results on the
enumeration of Motzkin paths, among which is a continued fraction result due to
Flajolet. As a bonus, we use these observations to derive further results and a
precise asymptotic estimate for the number of 132-avoiding permutations of
$\{1,2,...,n\}$ with exactly $r$ occurrences of the pattern $12... k$. Second,
we exhibit a bijection between 123-avoiding permutations and Dyck paths. When
combined with a result of Roblet and Viennot, this bijection allows us to
express the generating function for 123-avoiding permutations with a given
number of occurrences of the pattern $(k-1)(k-2)... 1k$ in form of a continued
fraction and to derive further results for these permutations.
