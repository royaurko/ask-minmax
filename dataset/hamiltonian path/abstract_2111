In this paper we consider the notion of commutation for a pair of continuous
and convex Hamiltonians, given in terms of commutation of their Lax- Oleinik
semigroups. This is equivalent to the solvability of an associated multi- time
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We examine the weak KAM theoretic aspects of the
commutation property and show that the two Hamiltonians have the same weak KAM
solutions and the same Aubry set, thus generalizing a result recently obtained
by the second contributor for Tonelli Hamiltonians. We make a further step by
proving that the Hamiltonians admit a common critical subsolution, strict
outside their Aubry set. This subsolution can be taken of class C^{1,1} in the
Tonelli case. To prove our main results in full generality, it is crucial to
establish suitable differentiability properties of the critical subsolutions on
the Aubry set. These latter results are new in the purely continuous case and
of independent interest.
