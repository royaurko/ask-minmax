We apply a method of group averaging to states and operators appearing in
(truncations of) the Spin(9) x SU(N) invariant matrix models. We find that
there is an exact correspondence between the standard supersymmetric
Hamiltonian and the Spin(9) average of a relatively simple lower-dimensional
model.
