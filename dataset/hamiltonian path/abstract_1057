Graphs are typically visualized as node-link diagrams. Although there is a
fair amount of research focusing on crossing minimization to improve
readability, little attention has been paid on how to handle crossings when
they are an essential part of the final visualizations. This requires us to
understand how people read graphs and how crossings affect reading performance.
  As an initial step to this end, a preliminary eye tracking experiment was
conducted. The specific purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of
crossing angles and geometric-path tendency on eye movements and performance.
Sixteen subjects performed both path search and node locating tasks with six
drawings. The results showed that small angles can slow down and trigger extra
eye movements, causing delays for path search tasks, whereas crossings have
little impact on node locating tasks. Geometric-path tendency indicates that a
path between two nodes can become harder to follow when many branches of the
path go toward the target node. The insights obtained are discussed with a view
to further confirmation in future work.
