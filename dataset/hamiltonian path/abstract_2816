It has been found that complex non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians
may have entirely real spectra and generate unitary time evolution if they
possess an unbroken $\cP\cT$ symmetry. A well-studied class of such
Hamiltonians is $H= p^2+x^2(ix)^\epsilon$ ($\epsilon\geq0$). This paper
examines the underlying classical theory. Specifically, it explores the
possible trajectories of a classical particle that is governed by this class of
Hamiltonians. These trajectories exhibit an extraordinarily rich and elaborate
structure that depends sensitively on the value of the parameter $\epsilon$ and
on the initial conditions. A system for classifying complex orbits is
presented.
