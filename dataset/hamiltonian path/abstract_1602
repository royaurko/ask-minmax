The harmonic explorer is a random grid path. Very roughly, at each step the
harmonic explorer takes a turn to the right with probability equal to the
discrete harmonic measure of the left-hand side of the path from a point near
the end of the current path. We prove that the harmonic explorer converges to
SLE(4) as the grid gets finer.
