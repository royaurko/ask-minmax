This paper gives tight upper bound on the largest eigenvalue q(G) of the
signless Laplacian of graphs with no paths of given order. The main ingredient
of our proof is a stability result of its own interest, about graphs with large
minimum degree and with no long paths. This result extends previous work of Ali
and Staton.
