Using the generalized coherent states we argue that the path integral
formulae for $SU(2)$ and $SU(1,1)$ (in the discrete series) are WKB exact,if
the starting point is expressed as the trace of $e^{-iT\hat H}$ with $\hat H$
being given by a linear combination of generators. In our case,WKB
approximation is achieved by taking a large ``spin'' limit: $J,K\rightarrow
\infty$. The result is obtained directly by knowing that the each coefficient
vanishes under the $J^{-1}$($K^{-1}$) expansion and is examined by another
method to be legitimated. We also point out that the discretized form of path
integral is indispensable, in other words, the continuum path integral
expression leads us to a wrong result. Therefore a great care must be taken
when some geometrical action would be adopted, even if it is so beautiful, as
the starting ingredient of path integral.
