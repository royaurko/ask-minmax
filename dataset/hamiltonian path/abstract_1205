We perform the Hamiltonian analysis of non-linear massive gravity action
studied recently in arXiv:1106.3344 [hep-th]. We show that the Hamiltonian
constraint is the second class constraint. As a result the theory possesses an
odd number of the second class constraints and hence all non physical degrees
of freedom cannot be eliminated.
