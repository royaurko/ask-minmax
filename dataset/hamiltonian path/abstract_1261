Transferring information from observations of a dynamical system to estimate
the fixed parameters and unobserved states of a system model can be formulated
as the evaluation of a discrete time path integral in model state space. The
observations serve as a guiding potential working with the dynamical rules of
the model to direct system orbits in state space. The path integral
representation permits direct numerical evaluation of the conditional mean path
through the state space as well as conditional moments about this mean. Using a
Monte Carlo method for selecting paths through state space we show how these
moments can be evaluated and demonstrate in an interesting model system the
explicit influence of the role of transfer of information from the
observations. We address the question of how many observations are required to
estimate the unobserved state variables, and we examine the assumptions of
Gaussianity of the underlying conditional probability.
