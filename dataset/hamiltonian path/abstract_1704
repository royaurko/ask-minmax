Hazrat gave a K-theoretic invariant for Leavitt path algebras as graded
algebras. Hazrat conjectured that this invariant classifies Leavitt path
algebras up to graded isomorphism, and proved the conjecture in some cases. In
this paper, we prove that a weak version of the conjecture holds for all finite
essential graphs.
