We construct a Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes a time-independent
emulation of quan- tum teleportation. We calculate properties of the
Hamiltonian, using exact diagonalization and a mean-field theory, and argue
that it has a gap. The system exhibits an illuminating relationship to the
well-known AKLT (Affleck, Lieb, Kennedy and Tasaki) model.
