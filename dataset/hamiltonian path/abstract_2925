We perform the Hamiltonian analysis for the lowest-order effective action, up
to second order in derivatives, of the complete Horava theory. The model
includes the invariant terms that depend on \partial_i ln N proposed by Blas,
Pujolas and Sibiryakov. We show that the algebra of constraints closes. The
"Hamiltonian" constraint is of second-class behavior and it can be regarded as
an elliptic partial differential equation for N. The linearized version of this
equation is a Poisson equation for N that can be solved consistently. The
preservation in time of the Hamiltonian constraint yields an equation that can
be consistently solved for a Lagrange multiplier of the theory. The model has
six propagating degrees of freedom in the phase space, corresponding to three
even physical modes. When compared with the \lambda R model studied by us in a
previous paper, it lacks two second-class constraints, which leads to the extra
even mode.
