An \emph{asteroidal triple} is a set of three independent vertices in a graph
such that any two vertices in the set are connected by a path which avoids the
neighbourhood of the third.
  A classical result by Lekkerkerker and Boland \cite{6} showed that interval
graphs are precisely the chordal graphs that do not have asteroidal triples.
  Interval graphs are chordal, as are the \emph{directed path graphs} and the
\emph{path graphs}.
  Similar to Lekkerkerker and Boland, Cameron, Ho\'{a}ng, and L\'{e}v\^{e}que
\cite{4} gave a characterization of directed path graphs by a "special type" of
asteroidal triple, and asked whether or not there was such a characterization
for path graphs.
  We give strong evidence that asteroidal triples alone are insufficient to
characterize the family of path graphs, and give a new characterization of path
graphs via a forbidden induced subgraph family that we call \emph{sun systems}.
  Key to our new characterization is the study of \emph{asteroidal sets} in sun
systems, which are a natural generalization of asteroidal triples.
  Our characterization of path graphs by forbidding sun systems also
generalizes a characterization of directed path graphs by forbidding odd suns
that was given by Chaplick et al.~\cite{9}.
