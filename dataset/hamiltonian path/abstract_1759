The one-dimensional Brownian motion starting from the origin at time $t=0$,
conditioned to return to the origin at time $t=1$ and to stay positive during
time interval $0 < t < 1$, is called the Bessel bridge with duration 1. We
consider the $N$-particle system of such Bessel bridges conditioned never to
collide with each other in $0 < t < 1$, which is the continuum limit of the
vicious walk model in watermelon configuration with a wall. Distributions of
maximum-values of paths attained in the time interval $t \in (0,1)$ are studied
to characterize the statistics of random patterns of the repulsive paths on the
spatio-temporal plane. For the outermost path, the distribution function of
maximum value is exactly determined for general $N$. We show that the present
$N$-path system of noncolliding Bessel bridges is realized as the
positive-eigenvalue process of the $2N \times 2N$ matrix-valued Brownian bridge
in the symmetry class C. Using this fact computer simulations are performed and
numerical results on the $N$-dependence of the maximum-value distributions of
the inner paths are reported. The present work demonstrates that the
extreme-value problems of noncolliding paths are related with the random matrix
theory, representation theory of symmetry, and the number theory.
