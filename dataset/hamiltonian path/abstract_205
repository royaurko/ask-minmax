The imaginary time path integral formalism is applied to a nonlinear
Hamiltonian for a short fragment of heterogeneous DNA with a stabilizing
solvent interaction term. Torsional effects are modeled by a twist angle
between neighboring base pairs stacked along the molecule backbone. The base
pair displacements are described by an ensemble of temperature dependent paths
thus incorporating those fluctuational effects which shape the multisteps
thermal denaturation. By summing over $\sim 10^7 - 10^8$ base pair paths, a
large number of double helix configurations is taken into account consistently
with the physical requirements of the model potential. The partition function
is computed as a function of the twist. It is found that the equilibrium twist
angle, peculiar of B-DNA at room temperature, yields the stablest helicoidal
geometry against thermal disruption of the base pair hydrogen bonds. This
result is corroborated by the computation of thermodynamical properties such as
fractions of open base pairs and specific heat.
