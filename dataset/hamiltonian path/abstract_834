Most of pointed Hopf algebras of dimension $p^m$ with large coradical are
shown to be generalized path algebras. By the theory of generalized path
algebras it is obtained that the representations, homological dimensions and
radicals of these Hopf algebras. The relations between the radicals of path
algebras and connectivity of directed graphs are given.
