We explore the distribution of paths followed in fluctuation-induced
switching between coexisting stable states. We introduce a quantitative
characteristic of the path distribution in phase space that does not require a
priori knowledge of system dynamics. The theory of the distribution is
developed and its direct measurement is performed in a micromechanical
oscillator driven into parametric resonance. The experimental and theoretical
results on the shape and position of the distribution are in excellent
agreement, with no adjustable parameters. In addition, the experiment provides
the first demonstration of the lack of time-reversal symmetry in switching of
systems far from thermal equilibrium. The results open the possibility of
efficient control of the switching probability based on the measured narrow
path distribution.
