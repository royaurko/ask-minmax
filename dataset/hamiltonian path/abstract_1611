We investigate the sample paths regularity of operator scaling alpha-stable
random fields. Such fields were introduced as anisotropic generalizations of
self-similar fields and satisfy a scaling property for a real matrix E. In the
case of harmonizable operator scaling random fields, the sample paths are
locally H\"{o}lderian and their H\"{o}lder regularity is characterized by the
eigen decomposition with respect to E. In particular, the directional
H\"{o}lder regularity may vary and is given by the eigenvalues of E. In the
case of moving average operator scaling random alpha-stable random fields, with
0<alpha<2, the sample paths are almost surely discontinous.
