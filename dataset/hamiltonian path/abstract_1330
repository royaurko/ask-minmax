By considering the Einstein vacuum field equations linearized about the
Minkowski metric, the evolution equations for the gauge-invariant quantities
characterizing the gravitational field are written in a Hamiltonian form by
using a conserved functional as Hamiltonian; this Hamiltonian is not the analog
of the energy of the field. A Poisson bracket between functionals of the field,
compatible with the constraints satisfied by the field variables, is obtained.
The generator of spatial translations associated with such bracket is also
obtained.
