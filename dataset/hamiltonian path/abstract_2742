The problem of weak ferromagnetism in antiferromagnets due to canting of
magnetic moments was treated using Green's function technique. At first the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the electronic Hamiltonian corresponding to
collinear magnetic configuration are calculated which are then used to
determine first and second variations of the total energy as a function of the
magnetic moments canting angle. Spin-orbit coupling is taken into account via
perturbation theory. The results of calculations are used to determine an
effective spin Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian can be mapped on conventional spin
Hamiltonian that allows to determine parameters of isotropic and anisotropic
(Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) exchange interactions. The method was applied to the
typical antiferromagnets with weak ferromagnetism Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and
La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$. The obtained directions and values of the magnetic moments
canting angles are in a reasonable agreement with experimental data.
