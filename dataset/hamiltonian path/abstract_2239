The Baxter 8-vertex model is equivalent to a particular lattice formulation
of a self-interacting, massive Dirac fermion theory. In the time-continuum
limit, the lattice Hamiltonian (XYZ spin chain) can be explicitly transformed
to a lattice Dirac Hamiltonian. We show that the kernel describing the
quadratic part of this Hamiltonian satisfies a one-dimensional version of the
Ginsparg-Wilson relation. The corresponding conserved charge is derived and
compared with the conserved arrow number of the 8-vertex model.
