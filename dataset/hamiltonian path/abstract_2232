Starting from a Lagrangian we perform the full constraint analysis of the
Hamiltonian for General relativity in the tetrad-connection formulation for an
arbitrary value of the Immirzi parameter and solve the second class
constraints, presenting the theory with a Hamiltonian composed of first class
constraints which are the generators of the gauge symmetries of the action. In
the time gauge we then recover Barbero's formulation of gravity.
