A microscopic formulation of Haldane's exclusions statistics is given in terms
of a priori occupation probabilities of states. It is shown that negative
probabilities are always necessary to reproduce fractional statistics. Based on
this formulation, a path-integral realization for systems with exclusion
statistics is derived. This has the advantage of being generalizable to
interacting systems, and can be used as the starting point for further
generalizations of statistics. As a byproduct, the vanishing of the heat
capacity at zero temperature for exclusion statistics systems is proved.
