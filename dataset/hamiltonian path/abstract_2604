We formulate a Lattice Hamiltonian approach for the modeling of intermediate
energy heavy ion collisions. After verifying stationary ground state solutions,
we implement this in a calculation of nuclear stopping power and compare our
results with experimental data. Our findings support a relatively soft nuclear
equation of state, with a momentum-dependent self-consistent mean field.
