To establish the presence and orientation of the proposed striped phase in
ultra-high mobility 2D electron systems at filling factor 9/2, current path
transport properties are determined by varying the separation and allignment of
current and voltage contacts. Contacts alligned orthogonal to the proposed
intrinsic striped phase produce voltages consistent with current spreading
along the stripes; current driven along the proposed stripe direction results
in voltages consistent with channeling along the stripes. Direct comparison is
made to current spreading/channeling properties of artificially induced 1D
charge modulated systems, which indicates the 9/2 direction.
