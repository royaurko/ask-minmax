Constrained Optimum Path (COP) problems appear in many real-life
applications, especially on communication networks. Some of these problems have
been considered and solved by specific techniques which are usually difficult
to extend. In this paper, we introduce a novel local search modeling for
solving some COPs by local search. The modeling features the compositionality,
modularity, reuse and strengthens the benefits of Constrained-Based Local
Search. We also apply the modeling to the edge-disjoint paths problem (EDP). We
show that side constraints can easily be added in the model. Computational
results show the significance of the approach.
