Left invariant metrics induced by the p-norms of the trace in the matrix
algebra are studied on the general lineal group. By means of the Euler-Lagrange
equations, existence and uniqueness of extremal paths for the length functional
are established, and regularity properties of these extremal paths are
obtained. Minimizing paths in the group are shown to have a velocity with
constant singular values and multiplicity. In several special cases, these
geodesic paths are computed explicitly. In particular the Riemannian geodesics,
corresponding to the case p=2, are characterized as the product of two
one-parameter groups. It is also shown that geodesics are one-parameter groups
if and only if the initial velocity is a normal matrix. These results are
further extended to the context of compact operators with p-summable spectrum,
where a differential equation for the spectral projections of the velocity
vector of an extremal path is obtained.
