We prove that Yang-Mills connections on a surface are characterized as those
with the property that the holonomy around homotopic closed paths only depends
on the oriented area between the paths. Using this we have an alternative proof
for a theorem of Atiyah and Bott that the Yang-Mills connections on a compact
orientable surface can be characterized by homomorphisms to the structure group
from an extension of the fundamental group of the surface. In addition, we
obtain the results that the Yang-Mills connections on the sphere are isolated
and correspond with the conjugacy classes of closed geodesics through the
identity in the structure group.
