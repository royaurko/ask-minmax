Hamiltonian time evolution in terms of an explicit parameter time is derived
for general relativity, even when the constraints are not satisfied, from the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner-Teitelboim-Ashtekar action in which the slicing density
$\alpha(x,t)$ is freely specified while the lapse $N=\alpha g^{1/2}$ is not.
The constraint ``algebra'' becomes a well-posed evolution system for the
constraints; this system is the twice-contracted Bianchi identity when
$R_{ij}=0$. The Hamiltonian constraint is an initial value constraint which
determines $g^{1/2}$ and hence $N$, given $\alpha$.
