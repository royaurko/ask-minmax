The spin Hamiltonian that describes the molecular magnet Fe$_8$ has biaxial
symmetry with mutually perpendicular easy, medium, and hard magnetic axes.
Previous calculations of the ground state tunnel splittings in the presence of
a magnetic field along the hard axis are extended, and the meaning of the
previously discovered oscillation of this splitting is further clarified.
