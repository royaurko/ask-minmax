We study a field--theoretical analogue of the Aharonov--Bohm effect in the
Abelian Higgs Model: the corresponding topological interaction is proportional
to the linking number of the Abrikosov--Nielsen--Olesen string world sheets and
the particle world trajectory. The creation operators of the strings are
explicitly constructed in the path integral and in the Hamiltonian formulation
of the theory. We show that the Aharonov--Bohm effect gives rise to several
nontrivial commutation relations. We also study the Aharonov--Bohm effect in
the lattice formulation of the Abelian Higgs Model. It occurs that this effect
gives rise to a nontrivial interaction of tested charged particles.
