For a system of n interacting electrons moving in the background of a
"homogeneous" potential, we show that, if the single electron Hamiltonian
admits a density of states, so does the interacting Hamiltonian. Moreover this
integrated density of states coincides with that of the free electron
Hamiltonian.
