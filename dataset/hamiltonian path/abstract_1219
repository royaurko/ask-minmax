We present a method to calculate the nonrelativistic hamiltonian for the
minimal Standard-Model Extension matter sector in a uniform gravitational
field. The resulting hamiltonian coincides with earlier results in the
corresponding limits but it also includes spin-dependent terms that were
previously unknown. The phenomenology associated with this hamiltonian is
briefly discussed.
