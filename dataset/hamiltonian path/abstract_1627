For given graphs $G$ and $H,$ the \emph{Ramsey number} $R(G,H)$ is the least
natural number $n$ such that for every graph $F$ of order $n$ the following
condition holds: either $F$ contains $G$ or the complement of $F$ contains $H.$
In this paper, we improve the Surahmat and Tomescu's result \cite{ST:06} on the
Ramsey number of paths versus Jahangirs. We also determine the Ramsey number
$R(\cup G,H)$, where $G$ is a path and $H$ is a Jahangir graph.
