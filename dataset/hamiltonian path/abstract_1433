A new method of abstracting the independent gauge invariances of higher
derivative systems, recently introduced in [1], has been applied to higher
derivative field theories. This has been discussed taking the extended
Maxwell-Chern-Simons model as an example. A new Hamiltonian analysis of the
model is provided. This Hamiltonian analysis has been used to construct the
independent gauge generator. An exact mapping between the Hamiltonian gauge
transformations and the U(1) symmetries of the action has been established.
