In this paper, we construct bijections between Dyck paths, noncrossing
partitions, and 231-avoiding permutations, which send the area statistic on
Dyck paths to the inversion number on noncrossing partitions and on
231-avoiding permutations. This bijection has the additional property that it
simultaneously sends the major index on Dyck paths to the sum of the major
index and the inverse major index on noncrossing partitions and on 231-avoiding
permutations, respectively. Moreover, we provide generalizations of these
constructions to the group of signed permutations.
