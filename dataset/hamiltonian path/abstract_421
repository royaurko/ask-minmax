We develop some formalism which is very general Feynman path integral in the
case of the action which is allowed to be complex. The major point is that the
effect of the imaginary part of the action (mainly) is to determine which
solution to the equations of motion gets realized. We can therefore look at the
model as a unification of the equations of motion and the ``initial
conditions". We have already earlier argued for some features matching well
with cosmology coming out of the model. A Hamiltonian formalism is put forward,
but it still has to have an extra factor in the probability of a certain
measurement result involving the time after the measurement time. A special
effect to be discussed is a broadening of the width of the Higgs particle. We
reach crudely a changed Breit-Wigner formula that is a normalized square root
of the originally expected one
