We will study the Hitchin's hamiltonian system for a modular stack of
principal SL_2(C) bundle on a smooth projective curve which has a parabolic
reduction at certain points. As an application we will obtain a generalization
of the Beilinson-Drinfeld isomorphism, which is a quantization of the Hitchin's
hamiltonian system.
