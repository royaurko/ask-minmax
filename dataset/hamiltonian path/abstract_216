A standard approach to investigate the non-perturbative QCD dynamics is
through vacuum models which emphasize the role played by specific gauge field
fluctuations, such as instantons, monopoles or vortexes. The effective
Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of the low-energy degrees of freedom in
such approaches is usually postulated phenomenologically, or obtained through
uncontrolled approximations. In a recent paper, we have shown how lattice field
theory simulations can be used to rigorously compute the effective Hamiltonian
of arbitrary vacuum models by stochastically performing the path integral over
all the vacuum field fluctuations which are not explicitly taken into account.
In this work, we present the first illustrative application of such an approach
to a gauge theory and we use it to compute the instanton size distribution in
SU(2) gluon-dynamics in a fully model independent and parameter-free way.
