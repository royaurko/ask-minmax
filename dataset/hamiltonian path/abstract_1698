We consider a class of stochastic growth models on the integer lattice which
includes various interesting examples such as the number of open paths in
oriented percolation and the binary contact path process. Under some mild
assumptions, we show that the total mass of the process grows exponentially in
time whenever it survives. More precisely, we prove that there exists an open
path, oriented in time, along which the mass grows exponentially fast.
