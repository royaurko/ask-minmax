For classical Hamiltonian systems, the adiabatic condition may fail at some
critical points. However, the breakdown of the adiabatic condition does not
always make the adiabatic evolution be destroyed. In this paper, we suggest a
supplemental condition of the adiabatic evolution for the fixed points of
classical Hamiltonian systems when the adiabatic condition breaks down at the
critical points. As an example, we investigate the adiabatic evolution of the
fixed points of a classical Hamiltonian system which has a number of
applications.
