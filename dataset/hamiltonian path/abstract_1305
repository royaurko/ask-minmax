We present a robotic exploration technique in which the goal is to learn to a
visual model and be able to distinguish between different terrains and other
visual components in an unknown environment. We use ROST, a realtime online
spatiotemporal topic modeling framework to model these terrains using the
observations made by the robot, and then use an information theoretic path
planning technique to define the exploration path. We conduct experiments with
aerial view and underwater datasets with millions of observations and varying
path lengths, and find that paths that are biased towards locations with high
topic perplexity produce better terrain models with high discriminative power,
especially with paths of length close to the diameter of the world.
