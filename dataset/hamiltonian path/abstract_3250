Consider a set of continuous maps from the interval $[0,1]$ to a domain in
${\mathbb R}^d$. Although the topological boundary of this set in the path
space is not smooth in general, by using the theory of functions of bounded
variation (BV functions) on the Wiener space and the theory of Dirichlet forms,
we can discuss the existence of the surface measure and the Skorokhod
representation of the reflecting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process associated with the
canonical Dirichlet form on this set.
