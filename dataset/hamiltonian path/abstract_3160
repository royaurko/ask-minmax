We construct a subcrystal of the Littelmann's path crystal whose formal
character coincides with that of a certain simple integrable module of level
zero over the untwisted affine Lie algebra associated to sl_n. We also
establish an analogue of the Littlewood-Richardson rule for the tensor product
of that crystal with a highest weight crystal.
