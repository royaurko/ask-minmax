The path integral generalization of the Casson invariant as developed by
Rozansky and Witten is investigated. The path integral for various three
manifolds is explicitly evaluated. A new class of topological observables is
introduced that may allow for more effective invariants. Finally it is shown
how the dimensional reduction of these theories corresponds to a generalization
of the topological B sigma model.
