A general algebraic condition for the functional independence of 2n-1
constants of motion of an n-dimensional maximal superintegrable Hamiltonian
system has been proved for an arbitrary finite n. This makes it possible to
construct, in a well-defined generic way, a normalized Nambu bracket which
produces the correct Hamiltonian time evolution. Existence and explicit forms
of pairwise compatible multi-Hamiltonian structures for any maximal
superintegrable system have been established. The Calogero-Moser system, motion
of a charged particle in a uniform perpendicular magnetic field and
Smorodinsky-Winternitz potentials are considered as illustrative applications
and their symmetry algebras as well as their Nambu formulations and alternative
Poisson structures are presented.
