A least action principle for damping motion has been previously proposed with
a Hamiltonian and a Lagrangian containing the energy dissipated by friction.
Due to the space-time nonlocality of the Lagrangian, mathematical uncertainties
persist about the appropriate variational calculus and the nature (maxima,
minima and inflection) of the stationary action. The aim of this work is to
make numerical simulation of damped motion and to compare the actions of
different paths in order to get evidence of the existence and the nature of
stationary action. The model is a small particle subject to conservative and
friction forces. Two conservative forces and three friction forces are
considered. The comparison of the actions of the perturbed paths with that of
the Newtonian path reveals the existence of extrema of action which are minima
for zero or very weak friction and shift to maxima when the motion is
overdamped. In the intermediate case, the action of the Newtonian path is
neither least nor most, meaning that the extreme feature of the Newtonian path
is lost. In this situation, however, no reliable evidence of stationary action
can be found from the simulation result.
