Hamiltonian Boundary Value Methods (in short, HBVMs) is a new class of
numerical methods for the efficient numerical solution of canonical Hamiltonian
systems. In particular, their main feature is that of exactly preserving, for
the numerical solution, the value of the Hamiltonian function, when the latter
is a polynomial of arbitrarily high degree. Clearly, this fact implies a
practical conservation of any analytical Hamiltonian function. In this notes,
we collect the introductory material on HBVMs contained in the HBVMs Homepage,
