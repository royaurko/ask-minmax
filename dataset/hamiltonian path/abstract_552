A bounded curvature path is a continuously differentiable piecewise $C^2$
path with bounded absolute curvature that connects two points in the tangent
bundle of a surface. In this work we study the homotopy classes of bounded
curvature paths for generic points in the tangent bundle of the Euclidean
plane. In particular, we characterize the behavior of homotopies of such paths
in terms of boundedness or unboundedness of their path length. Moreover, for a
type of configuration of elements in the tangent bundle we prove the existence
of a compact planar region in which no bounded curvature path lying on it can
be made homotopic to a path outside of the region. In particular, we establish
that for such type of configuration, the space of bounded curvature paths is
divided into two disjoint components.
