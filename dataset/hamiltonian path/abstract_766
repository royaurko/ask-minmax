In this article, we illustrate the flexibility of the algebraic integration
formalism introduced by M. Gubinelli (2004), by establishing an existence and
uniqueness result for delay equations driven by rough paths. We then apply our
results to the case where the driving path is a fractional Brownian motion with
Hurst parameter H>1/3.
