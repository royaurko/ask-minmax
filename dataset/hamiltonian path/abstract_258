We consider a fermionic determinant associated to a non covariant Quantum
Field Theory used to describe a non relativistic system in (1+1) dimensions. By
exploiting the freedom that arises when Lorentz invariance is not mandatory, we
determine the heat-kernel regulating operator so as to reproduce the correct
dispersion relations of the bosonic excitations. We also derive the Hamiltonian
of the functionally bosonized model and the corresponding currents. In this way
we were able to establish the precise heat-kernel regularization that yields
complete agreement between the path-integral and operational approaches to the
bosonization of the Tomonaga-Luttinger model.
