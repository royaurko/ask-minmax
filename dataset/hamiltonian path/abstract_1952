Two path integral representations for the $T$-matrix in nonrelativistic
potential scattering are derived and proved to produce the complete Born series
when expanded to all orders. They are obtained with the help of "phantom"
degrees of freedom which take away explicit phases that diverge for asymptotic
times. In addition, energy conservation is enforced by imposing a
Faddeev-Popov-like constraint in the velocity path integral. These expressions
may be useful for attempts to evaluate the path integral in real time and for
alternative multiple scattering expansions. Standard and novel eikonal-type
high-energy approximations and systematic expansions immediately follow.
