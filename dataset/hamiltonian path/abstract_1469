We apply a boost-invariant similarity renormalization group procedure to a
light-front Hamiltonian of a scalar field phi of bare mass mu and interaction
term g phi^3 in 6 dimensions using 3rd order perturbative expansion in powers
of the coupling constant g. The initial Hamiltonian is regulated using momentum
dependent factors that approach 1 when a cutoff parameter Delta tends to
infinity. The similarity flow of corresponding effective Hamiltonians is
integrated analytically and two counterterms depending on Delta are obtained in
the initial Hamiltonian: a change in mu and a change of g. In addition, the
interaction vertex requires a Delta-independent counterterm that contains a
boost invariant function of momenta of particles participating in the
interaction. The resulting effective Hamiltonians contain a running coupling
constant that exhibits asymptotic freedom. The evolution of the coupling with
changing width of effective Hamiltonians agrees with results obtained using
Feynman diagrams and dimensional regularization when one identifies the
renormalization scale with the width. The effective light-front Schroedinger
equation is equally valid in a whole class of moving frames of reference
including the infinite momentum frame. Therefore, the calculation described
here provides an interesting pattern one can attempt to follow in the case of
Hamiltonians applicable in particle physics.
