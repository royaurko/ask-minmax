We present a method of obtaining the quasi exact solution of the Jahn Teller
systems in the framework of osp(2,2) superalgebra. The hamiltonian have been
solved in the Bargmann-Fock space by obtaining an expression as linear and
bilinear combinations of the generators of osp(2,2). In particulare, we have
discussed quasi exact solvability of Exe Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian.
