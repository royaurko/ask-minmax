We study effects of disorder on the low energy single particle transport in a
normal wire surrounded by a superconductor. We show that the heat conductance
includes the Andreev diffusion decreasing with increase in the mean free path
$\ell $ and the diffusive drift produced by a small particle-hole asymmetry,
which increases with increasing $\ell$. The conductance thus has a minimum as a
function of $\ell$ which leads to a peculiar re-entrant localization as a
function of the mean free path.
