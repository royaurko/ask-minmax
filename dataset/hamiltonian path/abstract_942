We prove the existence of the O-U Dirichlet form and the damped O-U Dirichlet
form on path space over a general non-compact Riemannian manifold which is
complete and stochastically complete. We show a weighted log-Sobolev inequality
for the O-U Dirichlet form and the (standard) log-Sobolev inequality for the
damped O-U Dirichlet form. In particular, the Poincar\'e inequality (and the
super Poincar\'e inequality) can be established for the O-U Dirichlet form on
path space over a class of Riemannian manifolds with unbounded Ricci
curvatures. Moreover, we construct a large class of quasi-regular local
Dirichlet forms with unbounded random diffusion coefficients on the path space
over a general non-compact manifold.
