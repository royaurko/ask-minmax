We consider the finite field dependent BRST (FFBRST) transformations in the
context of Hamiltonian formulation using Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky method. The
non-trivial Jacobian of such transformations is calculated in extended phase
space. The contribution from Jacobian can be written as exponential of some
local functional of fields which can be added to the effective Hamiltonian of
the system. Thus, FFBRST in Hamiltonian formulation with extended phase space
also connects different effective theories. We establish this result with the
help of two explicit examples. We also show that the FFBRST transformations is
similar to the canonical transformtaions in the sector of Lagrange multiplier
and its corresponding momenta.
