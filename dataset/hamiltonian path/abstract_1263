Given a graph $H$, the size Ramsey number $r_e(H,q)$ is the minimal number
$m$ for which there is a graph $G$ with $m$ edges such that every $q$-coloring
of $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $H$. We study the size Ramsey number of
the directed path of length $n$ in oriented graphs, where no antiparallel edges
are allowed. We give nearly tight bounds for every fixed number of colors,
showing that for every $q\geq 1 $ there are constants $c_1 = c_1(q),c_2$ such
that $$\frac{c_1(q) n^{2q}(\log n)^{1/q}}{(\log\log n)^{(q+2)/q}} \leq
r_e(\overrightarrow{P_n},q+1) \leq c_2 n^{2q}(\log {n})^2.$$
  Our results show that the path size Ramsey number in oriented graphs is
asymptotically larger than the path size Ramsey number in general directed
graphs. Moreover, the size Ramsey number of a directed path is polynomially
dependent in the number of colors, as opposed to the undirected case.
  Our approach also gives tight bounds on $r_e(\overrightarrow{P_n},q)$ for
general directed graphs with $q \geq 3$, extending previous results.
