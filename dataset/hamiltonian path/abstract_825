A path deviation equation in the Parameterized Absolute Parallelism (PAP)
geometry is derived. This equation includes curvature and torsion terms. These
terms are found to be naturally quantized. The equation represents the
deviation from a general path equation, in the PAP-geometry, derived by the
contributor in a previous work. It is shown that, as the effect of the torsion, on
the deviation, increases, the effect of the curvature decreases. It is also
shown that the general path deviation equation can be reduced to the geodesic
deviation equation if PAP-geometry becomes Riemannian. The equation can be used
to study the deviation from the trajectories of spinning elementary particles.
