We study the conditions for obtaining maximally multipartite entangled states
(MMES) as non-degenerate eigenstates of Hamiltonians that involve only
short-range interactions. We investigate small-size systems (with a number of
qubits ranging from 3 to 5) and show some example Hamiltonians with MMES as
eigenstates.
