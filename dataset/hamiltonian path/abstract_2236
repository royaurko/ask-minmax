In this paper we can solve a Wheeler-DeWitt equation of the some
inhomogeneous spacetime models as a local solution. From the previous study of
up-to-down method we derived the static restriction relating the problem of the
time. Although static restriction does not commute with the general Hamiltonian
constraint, the Hamiltonian constraint of some mini-superspace models commute
with static restriction. We can quantize such inhomogeneous models. With
obtained result we can success to simplify the general local Hamiltonian
constraint.
