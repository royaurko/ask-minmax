Extending previous QCD Hamiltonian studies, we present a new renormalization
procedure which generates an effective Hamiltonian for the gluon sector. The
formulation is in the Coulomb gauge where the QCD Hamiltonian is renormalizable
and the Gribov problem can be resolved. We utilize elements of the Glazek and
Wilson regularization method but now introduce a continuous cut-off procedure
which eliminates non-local counterterms. The effective Hamiltonian is then
derived to second order in the strong coupling constant. The resulting
renormalized Hamiltonian provides a realistic starting point for approximate
many-body calculations of hadronic properties for systems with explicit gluon
degrees of freedom.
