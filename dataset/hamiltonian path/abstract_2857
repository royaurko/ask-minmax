A Hamiltonian formulation is given for the gravitational dynamics of two
spinning compact bodies to next-to-leading order ($G/c^4$ and $G^2/c^4$) in the
spin-orbit interaction. We use a novel approach (valid to linear order in the
spins), which starts from the second-post-Newtonian metric (in ADM coordinates)
generated by two spinless bodies, and computes the next-to-leading order
precession, in this metric, of suitably redefined ``constant-magnitude''
3-dimensional spin vectors ${\bf S}_1$, ${\bf S}_2$. We prove the Poincar\'e
invariance of our Hamiltonian by explicitly constructing ten phase-space
generators realizing the Poincar\'e algebra. A remarkable feature of our
approach is that it allows one to derive the {\it orbital} equations of motion
of spinning binaries to next-to-leading order in spin-orbit coupling without
having to solve Einstein's field equations with a spin-dependent stress tensor.
We show that our Hamiltonian (orbital and spin) dynamics is equivalent to the
dynamics recently obtained by Faye, Blanchet, and Buonanno, by solving
Einstein's equations in harmonic coordinates.
