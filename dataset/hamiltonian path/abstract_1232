The Rabi Hamiltonian is studied in the dispersive regime and ultra-strong
coupling. We employ a recent unitary transformation to obtain not only the
approximate Hamiltonian and its energy levels but also its eigenfunctions. The
relationship of the approximation with other regimes and their approximations
are also discussed.
