A novel expansion -- which generalizes Magnus expansion -- of the evolution
operator associated with a (in general, time-dependent) perturbed Hamiltonian
is introduced. It is shown that it has a wide range of possible solutions that
can be fitted according to computational convenience. The time-independent and
the adiabatic case are studied in detail.
