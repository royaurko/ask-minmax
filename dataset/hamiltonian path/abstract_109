In this paper, we study the dynamical aspects of the \emph{Hamiltonian
homeomorphism group} $Hameo(M,\omega)$ which was introduced by M\"uller and the
contributor. We introduce the notion of autonomous continuous Hamiltonian flows and
extend the well-known conservation of energy to such flows. The definitions of
the Hofer length and of the spectral invariants $\rho_a$ are extended to
continuous Hamiltonian paths, and the Hofer norm and the spectral norm
$\gamma:Ham(M,\omega) \to \R_+$ are generalized to the corresponding intrinsic
norms on $Hameo(M,\omega)$ respectively. Using these extensions, we also extend
the construction of Entov-Polterovich's Calabi quasi-morphism on $S^2$ to the
space of continuous Hamiltonian paths. We also discuss a conjecture concerning
extendability of Entov-Polterovich's quasi-morphism and its relation to the
extendability of Calabi homomorphism on the disc to $Hameo(D^2,\del D^2)$, and
their implication towards the simpleness question on the area preserving
homeomorphism groups of the disc $D^2$ and of the sphere $S^2$.
