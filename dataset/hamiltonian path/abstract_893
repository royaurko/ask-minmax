We give two distinct infinite-Hamiltonian representations for the Riemann
equation. One with first order Hamiltonian operators and another with third
order-first order Hamiltonian operators. Both representations contain an
arbitrary function of the dynamical variable. We prove that all the Hamiltonian
operators of the Riemann equation are mutually compatible.
