This work is an analytical calculation of the path probability for random
dynamics of mechanical system described by Langevin equation with Gaussian
noise. The result shows an exponential dependence of the probability on the
action. In the case of non dissipative limit, the action is the usual one in
mechanics in accordance with the previous result of numerical simulation of
random motion. In the case of dissipative motion, the action in the exponent of
the exponential probability is just the one proposed in a previous work (Q.A.
Wang, R. Wang, arXiv:1201.6309), an action defined for the total system
including the moving system and its environment receiving the dissipated
energy. In both cases, the result implies that the most probable paths are the
paths of least action which, in the limit of vanishing randomness, become the
regular paths minimizing the action.
