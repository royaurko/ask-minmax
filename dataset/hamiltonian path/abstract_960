In this paper, we give a polynomial time algorithm which determines if a
given graph containing a triangle and no induced seven-vertex path is
3-colorable, and gives an explicit coloring if one exists. In previous work, we
gave a polynomial time algorithm for three-coloring triangle-free graphs with
no induced seven-vertex path. Combined, our work shows that three-coloring a
graph with no induced seven-vertex path can be done in polynomial time.
