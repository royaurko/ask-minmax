I discuss in this paper the behaviour of the solutions of the so-called
q-hyperbolic potentials, i.e. P"oschl-Teller-like and conditionally solvable
potentials, in terms of the path integral formalism. The differences in
comparison to the usual P"oschl-Teller-like potentials are investigated,
including the discrete energy spectra and the bound state wave-functions.
