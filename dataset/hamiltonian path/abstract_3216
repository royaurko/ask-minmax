We give, for the first time, the English translation of a manuscript by
Ettore Majorana, which probably corresponds to the text for a seminar delivered
at the University of Naples in 1938, where he lectured on Theoretical Physics.
Some passages reveal a physical interpretation of the Quantum Mechanics which
anticipates of several years the Feynman approach in terms of path integrals,
independently of the underlying mathematical formulation.
