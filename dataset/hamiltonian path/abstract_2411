In the presence of feedback control by "Maxwell's demon," the second law of
thermodynamics and the nonequilibrium equalities such as the Jarzynski equality
need to be generalized. In this paper, we derive the generalized Jarzynski
equalities for classical Hamiltonian dynamics based on the Liouville's theorem,
which is the same approach as the original proof of the Jarzynski equality
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 2690 (1997)]. The obtained equalities lead to the
generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics for the Hamiltonian systems
in the presence of feedback control.
