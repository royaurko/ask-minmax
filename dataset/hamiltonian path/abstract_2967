We construct symplectic integrators for Lie-Poisson systems. The integrators
are standard symplectic (partitioned) Runge--Kutta methods. Their phase space
is a symplectic vector space with a Hamiltonian action with momentum map $J$
whose range is the target Lie--Poisson manifold, and their Hamiltonian is
collective, that is, it is the target Hamiltonian pulled back by $J$. The
method yields, for example, a symplectic midpoint rule expressed in 4 variables
for arbitrary Hamiltonians on $\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$. The method specializes in
the case that a sufficiently large symmetry group acts on the fibres of $J$,
and generalizes to the case that the vector space carries a bifoliation.
Examples involving many classical groups are presented.
