We propose a new method for generating new Hamiltonians for the development
of supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics for real as well as complex
systems.interestingly Hamiltonians which can be realised in this method, can
hardly be derieved using all previous formalisms developed so far.Further
examples discussed here include both shape invariant and shape non-invariant
potentials.We notice a new thing (which has not been revealed earlier) in the
case of shape invariant potentials i.e by suitable choice of parameters in
superpotential the generated hamiltonians satisfy either (i) SUSY conditions
i.e $E_{n}^{(+)} =E_{n+1}^{(-)}$ ; $E_{0}^{(-)}=0$ or (ii) Iso-spectral
condition i.e $E_{n}^{(+)}=E_{n}^{(-)}$ .However for non-shape invariant
potentials energy relations depend only in the choice of superpotentials.We
present both analytical as well as numerical results. PACS :11.30.Pb, 03.65.Db,
