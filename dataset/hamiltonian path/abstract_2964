Ferroelectric and multiferroic materials form an important class of
functional materials. Over the last twenty years, first-principles-based
effective Hamiltonian approaches have been successfully developed to simulate
these materials. In recent years, effective Hamiltonian approaches were further
combined with molecular dynamics methods to investigate terahertz dynamical
properties of various perovskites. With this combination, a variety of
ferroelectric and multiferroic materials, including BaTiO_{3}, Ba(Sr,Ti)O_{3},
Pb(Zr,Ti)O_{3}, BiFeO_{3}, and SrTiO_{3} bulks and films have been simulated,
which led to the understanding of complex phenomena and discovery of novel
effects. In this review, we first provide technical details about effective
Hamiltonians and molecular dynamics simulation. Then, we present applications
of the combination of these two techniques to different perovskites. Finally,
we also briefly discuss possible future directions of this approach.
