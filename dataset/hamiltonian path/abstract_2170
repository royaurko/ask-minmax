This paper reports on the INRIA group's approach to XML mining while
participating in the INEX XML Mining track 2005. We use a flexible
representation of XML documents that allows taking into account the structure
only or both the structure and content. Our approach consists of representing
XML documents by a set of their sub-paths, defined according to some criteria
(length, root beginning, leaf ending). By considering those sub-paths as words,
we can use standard methods for vocabulary reduction, and simple clustering
methods such as K-means that scale well. We actually use an implementation of
the clustering algorithm known as "dynamic clouds" that can work with distinct
groups of independent variables put in separate variables. This is useful in
our model since embedded sub-paths are not independent: we split potentially
dependant paths into separate variables, resulting in each of them containing
independant paths. Experiments with the INEX collections show good results for
the structure-only collections, but our approach could not scale well for large
structure-and-content collections.
