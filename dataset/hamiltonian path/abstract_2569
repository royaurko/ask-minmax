We show that solving the Maurer-Cartan equations is, essentially, the same
thing as performing the Hamiltonian reduction construction. In particular, any
differential graded Lie algebra equipped with an even nondegenerate invariant
bilinear form gives rise to modular stacks with symplectic structures.
