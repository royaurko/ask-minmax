We consider electrons in two dimensions in a strong magnetic field at half
filling of the lowest Landau level using the Chern-Simons approach. Starting
from a lattice Hamiltonian for the electrons, we derive a path integral (PI)
formulation for the composite fermions (CF) which respects the order of the
operators. We use a time lattice with intermediate times in order to have a PI
expressed in density fluctuations. This formulation reveals that there is no
infrared (IR) singularity in the grand-canonical potential in lowest order
perturbation theory.
