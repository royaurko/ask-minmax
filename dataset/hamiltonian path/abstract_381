Majorana fermion representations of the algebra associated with spin, charge,
and flavor currents have been used to transform the two-channel Kondo
Hamiltonian. Using a path integral formulation, we derive a reduced effective
action with long-range impurity spin-spin interactions at different imaginary
times. In the semiclassical limit, it is equivalent to a one-dimensional
Heisenberg spin chain with two-spin, three-spin, etc. long-range interactions,
as a generalization of the inverse-square long-range Haldane-Shastry spin
model. In this representation the elementary excitations are "semions", and the
non-Fermi-liquid low-energy properties of the two-channel Kondo model are
recovered.
