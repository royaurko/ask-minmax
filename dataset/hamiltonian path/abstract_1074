Precisely and automatically detection of faults in programs, is a software
engineering dream. Every effort in this regard takes us one step closer to
realizing it. Many efforts have been taken from the people of these areas on
testing, verification and debugging. We are proposing such effort for the
research community of this domain is using path conditions to generate a
minimal set of PLOFC (possible lines of faulty code). It's a run time method
that will effectively bring the minimal possible set of faulty lines of code
through the help of path conditions and some heuristics involved. In this paper
we are generating possible fault locations from programs using path conditions
which can put positive impact on the static analysis of programs. Further we
discuss the basic ideas regarding path conditions, the theory, and first
analysis results. This work is based on a previous work that uses the variable
dependences for fault detection. We showed some examples to the applicable of
this idea and can be useful for software verification.
