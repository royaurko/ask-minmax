We present a Lagrangian formulation for the general modified chiral model. We
use it to discuss the Hamiltonian formalism for this model and to derive the
commutation relations for the chiral field. We look at some explicit examples
and show that the Hamiltonian, containing a contribution involving a
Wess-Zumino term, is conserved, as required.
