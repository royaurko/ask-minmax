We consider light waves propagating clockwise and other light waves
propagating counterclockwise around a closed path in a plane (theoretically
with the help of stationary mirrors). The time difference between the two light
propagating path orientations constitutes the Sagnac effect. The general
relativistic expression for the Sagnac effect is discussed. It is shown that a
gravitational wave incident to the light beams at an arbitrary angle will not
induce a Sagnac effect so long as the wave length of the weak gravitational
wave is long on the length scale of the closed light beam paths. The
gravitational wave induced Sagnac effect is thereby null.
