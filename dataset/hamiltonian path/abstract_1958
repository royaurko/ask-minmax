In this note it is shown that the Maslov Index for pairs of Lagrangian Paths
as introduced by Cappell, Lee and Miller appears by parallel transporting
elements of (a certain complex line-subbundle of) the symplectic spinorbundle
over Euclidean space, when pulled back to an (embedded) Lagrangian submanifold
$L$, along closed or non-closed paths therein. In especially, the CLM-Index mod
4 determines the holonomy group of this line bundle w.r.t. the
Levi-Civita-connection on $L$, hence its vanishing mod 4 is equivalent to the
existence of a trivializing parallel section. Moreover, it is shown that the
CLM-Index determines parallel transport in that line-bundle along arbitrary
paths when compared to the parallel transport w.r.t. to the canonical flat
connection of Euclidean space, if the Lagrangian tangent planes at the
endpoints either coincide or are orthogonal. This is derived from a result on
parallel transport of certain elements of the dual spinorbundle along closed or
endpoint-transversal paths.
