Using a suitable Laguerre basis set that ensures a tridiagonal matrix
representation of the reference Hamiltonian, we were able to evaluate in closed
form the matrix representation of the associated Hamiltonian for few exactly
solvable 2D potentials. This enabled us to treat analytically the full
Hamiltonian and compute the associated bound states spectrum as the eigenvalues
of the associated analytical matrix representing their Hamiltonians. Finally we
compared our results satisfactorily with those obtained using the Gauss
quadrature numerical integration approach.
