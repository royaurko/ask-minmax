Motor skill is usually understood as a capability to perform faster and more
accurate movements than other, unskilled, individuals. In this study we
investigated motor skill learning using a path tracking task, where subjects
had to track various curved paths as fast as possible, in the absence of any
external perturbations. We found that subjects become better with practice,
producing faster and smoother movements even when tracking novel untrained
paths. Using a "searchlight" paradigm, where only a short segment of the path
ahead of the cursor was shown, we found that subjects with a higher tracking
skill demonstrated larger planning horizon, i.e. took a longer chunk of the
future path into account when computing the control policy for the upcoming
movement segment. This suggests that the motor system uses receding horizon
control, and its horizon length can increase with practice, resulting in an
increased accuracy of the movement controller.
