For a graph $G$ and integer $k\geq1$, we define the token graph $F_k(G)$ to
be the graph with vertex set all $k$-subsets of $V(G)$, where two vertices are
adjacent in $F_k(G)$ whenever their symmetric difference is a pair of adjacent
vertices in $G$. Thus vertices of $F_k(G)$ correspond to configurations of $k$
indistinguishable tokens placed at distinct vertices of $G$, where two
configurations are adjacent whenever one configuration can be reached from the
other by moving one token along an edge from its current position to an
unoccupied vertex. This paper introduces token graphs and studies some of their
properties including: connectivity, diameter, cliques, chromatic number,
Hamiltonian paths, and Cartesian products of token graphs.
