A plateau in a Motzkin path is a sequence of three steps: an up step, a
horizontal step, then a down step. We find three different forms for the
bivariate generating function for plateaus in Motzkin paths, then generalize to
longer plateaus. We conclude by describing a further generalization: a
continued fraction form from which one can easily derive new multivariate
generating functions for various kinds of path statistics. Several examples of
generating functions are given using this technique.
