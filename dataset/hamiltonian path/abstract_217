We study the use of truncated normal-ordered three-nucleon interactions in ab
initio nuclear structure calculations starting from chiral two- plus
three-nucleon Hamiltonians evolved consistently with the similarity
renormalization group (SRG). We present three key steps: (i) a rigorous
benchmark of the normal-ordering approximation in the importance-truncated
no-core shell model (IT-NCSM) for 4-He, 16-O, and 40-Ca; (ii) a direct
comparison of the IT-NCSM results with coupled-cluster calculations at the
singles and doubles level (CCSD) for 16-O; and (iii) first applications of
SRG-evolved chiral NN+3N Hamiltonians in CCSD for the medium-mass nuclei
16,24-O and 40,48-Ca. We show that the normal-ordered two-body approximation
works very well beyond the lightest isotopes and opens a path for ab initio
studies of medium-mass and heavy nuclei with chiral two- plus three-nucleon
interactions. At the same time we highlight the predictive power of chiral
Hamiltonians.
