Integrable Hamiltonians for higher spin periodic XXZ chains are constructed
in terms of the spin generators; explicit examples for spins up to 3/2 are
given. Relations between Hamiltonians for some U_q(sl_2)-symmetric and
U(1)-symmetric universal r-matrices are studied; their properties are
investigated. A certain modification of the higher spin periodic chain
Hamiltonian is shown to be an integrable U_q(sl_2)-symmetric Hamiltonian for an
open chain.
