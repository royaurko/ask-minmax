With this work we present two new methods for the generation of thermostated,
manifestly Hamiltonian dynamics and provide corresponding illustrations. The
basis for this new class of thermostats are the peculiar thermodynamics as
exhibited by logarithmic oscillators. These two schemes are best suited when
applied to systems with a small number of degrees of freedom.
