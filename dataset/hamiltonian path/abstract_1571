We propose in this paper an alternative method for the quantisation of
systems with first-class constraints. This method is a combination of the
coherent-state-path-integral quantisation developed by Klauder, with the ideas
of reduced state space quantisation. The key idea is that the physical Hilbert
space may be defined by a coherent-state path-integral on the reduced state
space and that the metric on the reduced state space that is necessary for the
regularisation of the path-integral may be computed from the geometry of the
classical reduction procedure. We provide a number of examples--notably the
relativistic particle. Finally we discuss the quantisation of systems, whose
reduced state space has orbifold-like singularities.
