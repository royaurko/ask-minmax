We analyze the proof of the Khalfin Theorem for neutral meson complex. The
consequences of this Theorem are discussed: using this Theorem we find, eg.,
that diagonal matrix elements of the exact effective Hamiltonian for the
neutral meson complex can not be equal if CPT symmetry holds and CP symmetry is
violated. The Properties of time evolution governed by a time--independent
effective Hamiltonian acting in the neutral mesons subspace of states are
considered. By means of the Khalfin's Theorem we show that if such Hamiltonian
is time--independent then the evolution operator for the total system
containing neutral meson complex can not be a unitary operator. Within a given
specific model we examine numerically the Khalfin's Theorem. We show for this
model in a graphic form how the Khalfin's Theorem works. We also show for this
model how the difference of the mentioned diagonal matrix elements of the
effective Hamiltonian varies in time.
