In plasma physics, a hybrid fluid-kinetic model is composed of a
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) part that describes a bulk fluid component and a
Vlasov kinetic theory part that describes an energetic plasma component. While
most hybrid models in the plasma literature are non-Hamiltonian, this paper
investigates a recent Hamiltonian variant in its two-dimensional configuration.
The corresponding Hamiltonian structure is described along with its Casimir
invariants. Then, the energy-Casimir method is used to derive explicit
sufficient stability conditions, which imply a stable spectrum and suggest
nonlinear stability.
