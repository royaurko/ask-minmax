We present a new method to study disordered systems in the low temperature
limit. The method uses the replicated Hamiltonian. It studies the saddle points
of this Hamiltonian and shows how the various saddle point contributions can be
resummed in order to obtain the scaling behaviour at low temperatures. In a
large class of strongly disordered systems, it is necessary to include saddle
points of the Hamiltonian which break the replica symmetry in a vector sector,
as opposed to the usual matrix sector breaking of spin glass mean field theory.
