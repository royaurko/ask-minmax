The well-known geometric approach to field theory is based on description of
classical fields as sections of fibred manifolds, e.g. bundles with a structure
group in gauge theory. In this approach, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms
including the multiomentum Hamiltonian formalism are phrased in terms of jet
manifolds. Then, configuration and phase spaces of fields are
finite-dimensional. Though the jet manifolds have been widely used for theory
of differential operators, the calculus of variations and differential
geometry, this powerful mathematical methods remains almost unknown for
physicists. This Supplementary to our previous article (hep-th/9403172) aims to
summarize necessary requisites on jet manifolds and general connections.
