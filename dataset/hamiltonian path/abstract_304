Based on stochastic curvilinear integrals in the Cairoli-Walsh sense and in
the It\^{o}-Udri\c{s}te sense, we develop an original theory regarding the
multitime stochastic differential systems. The first group of the original
results refer to the complete integrable stochastic differential systems, the
path independent stochastic curvilinear integral, the It\^{o}-Udri\c{s}te
stochastic calculus rules, examples of path independent processes, and
volumetric processes. The second group of original results include the
multitime It\^{o}-Udri\c{s}te product formula, first stochastic integrals and
adjoint multitime stochastic Pfaff systems. Thirdly, we formulate and we prove
a multitime maximum principle for optimal control problems based on stochastic
curvilinear integral actions subject to multitime It\^{o}-Udri\c{s}te process
constraints. Our theory requires the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian as
stochastic 1-forms.
