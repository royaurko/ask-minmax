Using the theory of self-adjoint extensions, we construct all the possible
hamiltonians describing the non relativistic Aharonov-Bohm effect. In general
the resulting hamiltonians are not rotationally invariant so that the angular
momentum is not a constant of motion. Using an explicit formula for the
resolvent, we describe the spectrum and compute the generalized eigenfunctions
and the scattering amplitude.
