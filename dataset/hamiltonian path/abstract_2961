Information geometry provides a tool to systematically investigate parameter
sensitivity of the state of a system. If a physical system is described by a
linear combination of eigenstates of a complex (that is, non-Hermitian)
Hamiltonian, then there can be phase transitions where dynamical properties of
the system change abruptly. In the vicinities of the transition points, the
state of the system becomes highly sensitive to the changes of the parameters
in the Hamiltonian. The parameter sensitivity can then be measured in terms of
the Fisher-Rao metric and the associated curvature of the parameter-space
manifold. A general scheme for the geometric study of parameter-space manifolds
of eigenstates of complex Hamiltonians is outlined here, leading to generic
expressions for the metric.
