While considering a class of generalized negative binomial states, we verify
that the basic minimum properties for these states to be considered as coherent
states are satisfied. We particularize them for the case of the Hamiltonian of
the isotonic oscillator and we determine the corresponding Husimi's Q-function.
This function may be used to determine a lower bound for the thermodynamical
potential of the Hamiltonian by applying a Berezin-Lieb inequality
