We revisit the no-scale ripple inflation model, where no-scale supergravity
is modified by an additional term for the inflaton field in the Kahler
potential. This term not only breaks one SU(N,1) symmetry explicitly, but also
plays an important role for inflation. We generalize the superpotential in the
no-scale ripple inflation model slightly. There exists a discrete Z_2
symmetry/parity in the scalar potential in general, which can be preserved or
violated by the non-canonical nomalized inflaton kinetic term. Thus, there are
three inflation paths: one parity invariant path, and the left and right paths
for parity violating scenario. We show that the inflations along the parity
invariant path and right path are consistent with the Planck results. However,
the gavitino mass for the parity invariant path is so large that the inflation
results will be invalid if we consider the inflaton supersymmetry breaking soft
mass term. Thus, only the inflation along the right path gives the correct and
consistent results. Notably, the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such case can be
large, with a value around 0.05, which may be probed by the future Planck
experiment.
