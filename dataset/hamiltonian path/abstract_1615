The 2-matrix models can be defined in a setting more general than polynomial
potentials, namely, the semiclassical matrix model. In this case, the
potentials are such that their derivatives are rational functions, and the
integration paths for eigenvalues are arbitrary homology classes of paths for
which the integral is convergent. This choice includes in particular the case
where the integration path has fixed endpoints, called hard edges. The hard
edges induce boundary contributions in the loop equations. The purpose of this
article is to give the loop equations in that semicassical setting.
