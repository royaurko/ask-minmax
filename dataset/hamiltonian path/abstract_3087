Quantum gravity is studied in the path integral formulation applying the
Regge calculus. Restricting the quadratic link lengths of the originally
triangular lattice the path integral can be transformed to the partition
function of a spin system with higher couplings on a Kagome lattice. Various
measures acting as external field are considered. Extensions to matter fields
and higher dimensions are discussed.
