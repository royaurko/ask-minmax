In this paper the space of images is considered as a Riemannian manifold
using the metamorphosis approach, where the underlying Riemannian metric
simultaneously measures the cost of image transport and intensity variation. A
robust and effective variational time discretization of geodesics paths is
proposed. This requires to minimize a discrete path energy consisting of a sum
of consecutive image matching functionals over a set of image intensity maps
and pairwise matching deformations. For square-integrable input images the
existence of discrete, connecting geodesic paths defined as minimizers of this
variational problem is shown. Furthermore, $\Gamma$-convergence of the
underlying discrete path energy to the continuous path energy is proved. This
includes a diffeomorphism property for the induced transport and the existence
of a square-integrable weak material derivative in space and time. A spatial
discretization via finite elements combined with an alternating descent scheme
in the set of image intensity maps and the set of matching deformations is
presented to approximate discrete geodesic paths numerically. Computational
results underline the efficiency of the proposed approach and demonstrate
important qualitative properties.
