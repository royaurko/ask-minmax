In this paper, we apply the Boole discrete line integral to solve the Lorentz
force system which is written as a non-canonical Hamiltonian system. The method
is exactly energy-conserving for polynomial Hamiltonians of degree $\nu \leq
4$. In any other case, the energy can also be conserved approximatively. With
comparison to well-used Boris method, numerical experiments are presented to
demonstrate the energy-preserving property of the method.
