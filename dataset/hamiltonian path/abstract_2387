We present a parent Hamiltonian for weakly dimerized valence bond solid
states for arbitrary half-integral S. While the model reduces for S=1/2 to the
Majumdar-Ghosh Hamiltonian we discuss this model and its properties for S=3/2.
Its degenerate ground state is the most popular toy model state for discussing
dimerization in spin 3/2 chains. In particular, it describes the impurity
induced dimer phase in Cr8Ni as proposed recently. We point out that the
explicit construction of the Hamiltonian and its main features apply to
arbitrary half-integral spin S.
