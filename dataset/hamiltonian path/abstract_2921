his paper reviews modern geometrical dynamics and control of humanoid robots.
This general Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism starts with a proper
definition of humanoid's configuration manifold, which is a set of all robot's
active joint angles. Based on the `covariant force law', the general humanoid's
dynamics and control are developed. Autonomous Lagrangian dynamics is
formulated on the associated `humanoid velocity phase space', while autonomous
Hamiltonian dynamics is formulated on the associated `humanoid momentum phase
space'. Neural-like hierarchical humanoid control naturally follows this
geometrical prescription. This purely rotational and autonomous dynamics and
control is then generalized into the framework of modern non-autonomous
biomechanics, defining the Hamiltonian fitness function. The paper concludes
with several simulation examples.
