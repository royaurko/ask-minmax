Representation of the elastic scattering amplitude in the form of the path
integral is obtained using the stationary Schroedinger equation. A few methods
of evaluation of path integrals for large coupling constants are formulated.
The methods are based on the uncertainty correlation. The scattering lengths
and cross sections are calculated for the right angled and singular potentials
and the Yukawa potential. The comparison with exact results is made.
