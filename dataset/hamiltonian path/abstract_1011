We propose three effective Hamiltonians which approximate atoms in very
strong homogeneous magnetic fields $B$ modelled by the Pauli Hamiltonian, with
fixed total angular momentum with respect to magnetic field axis. All three
Hamiltonians describe $N$ electrons and a fixed nucleus where the Coulomb
interaction has been replaced by $B$-dependent one-dimensional effective
(vector valued) potentials but without magnetic field. Two of them are solvable
in at least the one electron case. We briefly sketch how these Hamiltonians can
be used to analyse the bottom of the spectrum of such atoms.
