We apply Kutzelnigg's method for the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) transformation
upon the Dirac-Pauli Hamiltonian. The exact FW transformations exist and agree
with those obtained by Eriksen's method for two special cases. In the
weak-field limit of static and homogeneous electromagnetic fields, the
long-held speculation is rigorously proven, by mathematical induction on the
orders of $1/c$ in the power series, that the FW transformed Dirac-Pauli
Hamiltonian is in full agreement with the classical counterpart, which is the
sum of the orbital Hamiltonian for the Lorentz force equation and the spin
Hamiltonian for the Thomas-Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation.
