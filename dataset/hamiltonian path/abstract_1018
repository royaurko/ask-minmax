A detailed analysis of matrix Darboux transformations under the condition
that the derivative of the superpotential be self-adjoint is given. As a
onsequence, a class of the symmetries associated to Schr\"odinger matrix
Hamiltonians is characterized. The applications are oriented towards the
Jaynes-Cummings eigenvalue problem, so that exactly solvable $2\times 2$ matrix
Hamiltonians of the Jaynes-Cummings type are obtained. It is also established
that the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian is a quadratic function of a Dirac-type
Hamiltonian.
