The most important aim in tool path generation methods is to increase the
machining efficiency by minimizing the total length of tool paths while the
error is kept under a prescribed tolerance. This can be achieved by determining
the moving direction of the cutting tool such that the machined stripe is the
widest. From a technical point of view it is recommended that the angle between
the tool axis and the surface normal does not change too much along the tool
path in order to ensure even abrasion of the tool. In this paper a mathematical
method for tool path generation in 3-axis milling is presented, which considers
these requirements by combining the features of isophotic curves and principal
curvatures. It calculates the proposed moving direction of the tool at each
point of the surface. The proposed direction depends on the measurement of the
tool and on the curvature values of the surface. For triangulated surfaces a
new local offset computation method is presented, which is suitable also for
detecting tool collision with the target surface and self intersection in the
offset mesh.
