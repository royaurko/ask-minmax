Thomassen conjectured that there is a function $f(k)$ such that every
strongly $f(k)$-connected tournament contains $k$ edge-disjoint Hamiltonian
cycles. This conjecture was recently proved by K\"uhn, Lapinskas, Osthus, and
Patel who showed that $f(k)\leq O(k^2(\log k)^2)$ and conjectured that there is
a constant $C$ such that $f(k)\leq Ck^2$. We prove this conjecture.
