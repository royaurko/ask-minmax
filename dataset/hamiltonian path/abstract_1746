Given a set \cal{P} of non-intersecting convex obstacles, we find a sketch
\Omega of \cal{P} that helps in finding an obstacle avoiding approximate
Euclidean shortest path between two given points amid \mathcal{P} efficiently.
For both \mathbb{R}^2 and \mathbb{R}^3, we devise algorithms to compute a
(1+\epsilon)-approximate shortest path when two points s and t are given a
priori with the polygonal domain. Further, in \mathbb{R}^2, we devise an
algorithm to preprocess obstacles to output a (2+\epsilon)-approximate distance
between any given pair of query points. In \mathbb{R}^2, the data structures
constructed at the end of the preprocessing are improving the space complexity
of the known algorithms.
