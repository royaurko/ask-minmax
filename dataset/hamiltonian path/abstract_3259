We propose a method, which enables precise control of magnetic patterns,
relying only on the fundamental properties of the wire and the choice of the
path in the controlled parameter space but not on the rate of motion along this
path. Possible experimental realizations of this mechanism are discussed. In
particular, we show that the domain walls in magnetic nanowires can be
translated by rotation of the magnetic easy axis, or by applying pulses of
magnetic field directed transverse to the magnetic easy axis.
