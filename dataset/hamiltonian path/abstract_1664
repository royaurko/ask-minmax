We calculate the neutrino mean free path with non-Fermi liquid (NFL)
corrections in quark matter from scattering and absorption processes for both
degenerate and nondegenerate neutrinos. We show that the mean free path
decreases due to the non-Fermi liquid corrections leading to
$l_{mean}^{-1}\sim[......+ .... C_F^2\alpha_s^2\ln(m_D/T)^2]$. These reduction
results in higher rate of scattering.
