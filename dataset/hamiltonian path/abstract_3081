In this talk we discuss the quantisation of a class of string cosmology
models characterised by scale factor duality invariance. The amplitudes for the
full set of classically allowed and forbidden transitions are computed by
applying the reduced phase space and path integral methods. In particular, the
path integral calculation clarifies the meaning of the instanton-like behaviour
of the transition amplitudes that has been first pointed out in previous
investigations.
