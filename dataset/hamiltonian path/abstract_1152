Phase space of a characteristic Hamiltonian system is a symplectic leaf of a
factorizable Poisson Lie group. Its Hamiltonian is a restriction to the
symplectic leaf of a function on the group which is invariant with respect to
conjugations. It is shown in this paper that such system is always integrable.
