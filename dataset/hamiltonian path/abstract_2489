In this paper we define a family of systems which have similarities with the
Toda lattice. We construct two Lax pair representations and the associate
Poisson structures for these systems. These systems lie between the classical
Toda lattice and the full Kostant-Toda lattice. A Hamiltonian and a
bi-Hamiltonian structure for these systems is constructed and also master
symmetries for some low dimensional cases are presented.
