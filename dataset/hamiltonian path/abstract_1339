A correction to the Hamiltonian of the quark-antiquark system, arising due to
the rigidity term in the gluodynamics string effective action, is obtained.
This correction contains additional contributions to the orbital momentum of
the system and several higher derivative operators. With the help of the
derived Hamiltonian a rigid string-induced term in the Hamiltonian of the
relativistic quark model is evaluated for the case of large masses of a quark
and antiquark.
