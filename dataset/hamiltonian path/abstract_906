It is known that a lattice path matroid polytope can be associated with two
given noncrossing lattice paths on $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ with the same
end points. In this short note we give explicit formulae for the $f$-vector,
toric $f$- and $g$-polynomials of a lattice path matroid polytope when two
boundary paths enclose a hook shape.
