We propose a classical constrained Hamiltonian theory for the spin. After the
Dirac treatment we show that due to the existence of second class constraints
the Dirac brackets of the proposed theory represent the commutation relations
for the spin. We show that the corresponding partition function, obtained via
the Fadeev-Senjanovic procedure, coincides with the one obtained using coherent
states. We also evaluate this partition function for the case of a single spin
in a magnetic field.
