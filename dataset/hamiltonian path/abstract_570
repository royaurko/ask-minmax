We consider real analytic Hamiltonians whose flow depends linearly on time.
Trivial examples are Hamiltonians $H(q,p)$ that do not depend on the coordinate
$q$. By a theorem of Moser, every polynomial Hamiltonian of degree 3 reduces to
such a $q$-independent Hamiltonian via a linear symplectic change of variables.
We show that such a reduction is impossible, in general, for polynomials of
degree 4 or higher. But we give a condition that implies linear-symplectic
conjugacy to another simple class of Hamiltonians. The condition is shown to
hold for all nondegenerate Hamiltonians that are homogeneous of degree 4.
