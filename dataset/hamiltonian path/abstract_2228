The zero-temperature phase diagram for ultracold Bosons in a random 1D
potential is obtained through a site-decoupling mean-field scheme performed
over a Bose-Hubbard (BH) Hamiltonian whose hopping term is considered as a
random variable. As for the model with random on-site potential, the presence
of disorder leads to the appearance of a Bose-glass phase. The different phases
-i.e. Mott insulator, superfluid, Bose-glass- are characterized in terms of
condensate fraction and superfluid fraction. Furthermore, the boundary of the
Mott lobes are related to an off-diagonal Anderson model featuring the same
disorder distribution as the original BH Hamiltonian.
