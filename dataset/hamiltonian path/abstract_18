This paper explores finding existence of undirected hamiltonian paths in a
graph using lumped/ideal circuits, specifically low-pass filters. While other
alternatives are possible, a first-order RC low-pass filter is chosen to
describe the process. The paper proposes a way of obtaining time complexity for
counting the number of hamiltonian paths in a graph, and then shows that the
time complexity of the circuits is around $O(n \log n)$ where $n$ is the number
of vertices in a graph.
