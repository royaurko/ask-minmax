Let G be a graph and let \Delta,\delta be the maximum and minimum degrees of
G respectively, where \Delta/\delta<c<\sqrt{2} and c is a constant. In this
paper we establish a sufficient spectral condition for the graph G to be
Hamiltonian, that is, the nontrivial eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian of
G are sufficiently close to 1.
