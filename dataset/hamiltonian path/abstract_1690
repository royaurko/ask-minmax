We show that the laws of scaling limits of nearcritical percolation
exploration paths with different parameters are singular with respect to each
other. This generalises a result of Nolin and Werner, using a similar
technique. As a corollary, the singularity can even be detected from an
infinitesimal initial segment. Moreover, nearcritical scaling limits of
exploration paths are mutually singular under scaling maps.
