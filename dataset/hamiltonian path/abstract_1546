We review some of the strategies that can be implemented to infer an
$R$-matrix from the knowledge of its Hamiltonian. We apply them to the
classification achieved in arXiv:1306.6303, on three state $U(1)$-invariant
Hamiltonians solvable by CBA, focusing on models for which the $S$-matrix is
not trivial.
  For the 19-vertex solutions, we recover the $R$-matrices of the well-known
Zamolodchikov--Fateev and Izergin--Korepin models. We point out that the
generalized Bariev Hamiltonian is related to both main and special branches
studied by Martins in arXiv:1303.4010, that we prove to generate the same
Hamiltonian. The 19-vertex SpR model still resists to the analysis, although we
are able to state some no-go theorems on its $R$-matrix.
  For 17-vertex Hamiltonians, we produce a new $R$-matrix.
