This letter presents a probabilistic omnidirectional millimeter-wave path
loss model based on real-world 28 GHz and 73 GHz measurements collected in New
York City. The probabilistic path loss approach uses a free space line-of-sight
propagation model, and for non-line-of-sight conditions uses either a close-in
free space reference distance path loss model or a floating-intercept path loss
model. The probabilistic model employs a weighting function that specifies the
line-of-sight probability for a given transmitter-receiver separation distance.
Results show that the probabilistic path loss model offers virtually identical
results whether one uses a non-line-of-sight close-in free space reference
distance path loss model, with a reference distance of 1 meter, or a
floating-intercept path loss model. This letter also shows that site-specific
environmental information may be used to yield the probabilistic weighting
function for choosing between line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions.
