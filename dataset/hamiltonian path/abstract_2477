We consider the $C^1$-classification of gapped Hamiltonians introduced in
[Fannes-Nachtergaele-Werner, Nachtergaele] as parents Hamiltonians of
translation invariant finitely correlated states. Within this family, we show
that the number of edge modes, which is equal at the left and right edge, is
the complete invariant. The construction proves that translation invariance of
the `bulk' ground state does not need to be broken to establish
$C^1$-equivalence, namely that the spin chain does not need to be blocked.
