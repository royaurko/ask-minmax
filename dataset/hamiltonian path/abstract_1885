Probabilistic Cell Decomposition (PCD) is a probabilistic path planning
method combining the concepts of approximate cell decomposition with
probabilistic sampling. It has been shown that the use of lazy evaluation
techniques and supervised sampling in important areas result in a high
performance path planning method. Even if it was postulated before that PCD is
probabilistically complete, we present a detailed proof of probabilistic
completeness here for the first time.
