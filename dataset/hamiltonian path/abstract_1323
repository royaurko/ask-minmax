The Bar\'at-Thomassen conjecture asserts that there is a function $f$ such
that for every fixed tree $T$ with $t$ edges, every graph which is
$f(t)$-edge-connected with its number of edges divisible by $t$ has a partition
of its edges into copies of $T$. This has been proved in the case of paths of
length $2^k$ by Thomassen, and recently shown to be true for all paths by
Botler, Mota, Oshiro and Wakabayashi. Our goal in this paper is to propose an
alternative proof of the path case with a weaker hypothesis: Namely, we prove
that there is a function $f$ such that every $24$-edge-connected graph with
minimum degree $f(t)$ has an edge-partition into paths of length $t$ whenever
$t$ divides the number of edges. We also show that $24$ can be dropped to $4$
when the graph is eulerian.
