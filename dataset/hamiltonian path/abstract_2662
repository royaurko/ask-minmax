New symmetry transformations for the n-dimensional Toda lattice are
presented. Their existence allows for the construction of several first order
Lagrangian structures associated to them. The multi-Hamiltonian structures are
derived from Lagrangians in detail. The set of symmetries generates a Lie
algebra.
