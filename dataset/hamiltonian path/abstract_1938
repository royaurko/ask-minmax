A novel, 3-dimensional, convex, multi-pass optical cavity with
partially-chaotic ray dynamics is presented. The light is localized near
stable, long-path length trajectories supported by the cavity, and beam
diffraction is suppressed by the phase space barriers between the regions of
regular and chaotic ray dynamics that are generally present in
partially-chaotic systems. For a centimeter-size cavity, the design supports
meter-scale optical path lengths, suggesting future applications in trace gas
detection. An exemplary cavity has been fabricated from a hollow, gold-coated,
acrylic shell. Our measurements using a HeNe laser and a pulsed red diode laser
for characterization of the cavity beam pattern and optical path length,
respectively, confirm the theoretically predicted optical dynamics and the
ability of the cavity to support meter-scale path lengths.
