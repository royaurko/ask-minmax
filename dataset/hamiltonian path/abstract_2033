We investigate the theoretical and numerical computation of rare transitions
in simple geophysical turbulent models. We consider the barotropic
quasi-geostrophic and two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in regimes where
bistability between two coexisting large-scale attractors exist. By means of
large deviations and instanton theory with the use of an Onsager-Machlup path
integral formalism for the transition probability, we show how one can directly
compute the most probable transition path between two coexisting attractors
analytically in an equilibrium (Langevin) framework and numerically otherwise.
We adapt a class of numerical optimization algorithms known as minimum action
methods to simple geophysical turbulent models. We show, that by numerically
minimizing an appropriate action functional, in a large deviation limit, one
can predict the most likely transition path for a rare transition between two
states. By considering examples where theoretical predictions can be made, we
show that the minimum action method successfully predicts the most likely
transition path. Finally, we discuss the application and extension of such
numerical optimization schemes to compute rare transitions observed in direct
numerical simulations, experiments and to other, more complex, turbulent
systems.
