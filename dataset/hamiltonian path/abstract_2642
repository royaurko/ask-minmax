We consider the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with a cubic nonlinearity on
the circle, which is known to represent an integrable Hamiltonian system. We
construct a global coordinate systems, which puts this Hamiltonian into
standard normal form, so that it depends only on the actions of the system.
