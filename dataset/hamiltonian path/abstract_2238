We discuss an algorithm for the approximate solution of Schrodinger's
equation for lattice gauge theory, using lattice SU(3) as an example. A basis
is generated by repeatedly applying an effective Hamiltonian to a ``starting
state.'' The resulting basis has a cluster decomposition and long-range
correlations. One such basis has about 10^4 states on a 10X10X10 lattice. The
Hamiltonian matrix on the basis is sparse, and the elements can be calculated
rapidly. The lowest eigenstates of the system are readily calculable.
