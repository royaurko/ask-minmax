Consider the random hypercube $H_2^n(p_n)$ obtained from the hypercube
$H_2^n$ by deleting any given edge with probabilty $1-p_n$, independently of
all the other edges. A diameter path in $H_2^n$ is a longest geodesic path in
$H_2^n$. Consider the following two ways of tampering with the random graph
$H_2^n(p_n)$: (i) choose a diameter path at random and adjoin all of its edges
to $H_2^n(p_n)$; (ii) choose a diameter path at random from among those that
start at $0=(0,..., 0)$, and adjoin all of its edges to $H_2^n(p_n)$. We study
the question of whether these tamperings are detectable asymptotically as
$n\to\infty$.
