We study pathwise entropy solutions for scalar conservation laws with
inhomogeneous fluxes and quasilinear multiplicative rough path dependence. This
extends the previous work of Lions, Perthame and Souganidis who considered
spatially independent and inhomogeneous fluxes with multiple paths and a single
driving singular path respectively. The approach is motivated by the theory of
stochastic viscosity solutions which relies on special test functions
constructed by inverting locally the flow of the stochastic characteristics.
For conservation laws this is best implemented at the level of the kinetic
formulation which we follow here.
