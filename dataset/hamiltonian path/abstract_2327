We consider the solution of a generalized Exe Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian in the
context of quasi-exactly solvable spectral problems. This Hamiltonian is
expressed in terms of the generators of the osp(2,2) Lie algebra. Analytical
expressions are obtained for eigenstates and eigenvalues. The solutions lead to
a number of earlier results discussed in the literature. However, our approach
renders a new understanding of ``exact isolated'' solutions.
