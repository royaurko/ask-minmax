Many robotic applications, such as milling, gluing, or high precision
measurements, require the exact following of a pre-defined geometric path. In
this paper, we investigate the real-time feasible implementation of model
predictive path-following control for an industrial robot. We consider
constrained output path following with and without reference speed assignment.
We present results from an implementation of the proposed model predictive
path-following controller on a KUKA LWR IV robot.
