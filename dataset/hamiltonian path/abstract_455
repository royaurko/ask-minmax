Resonance-assisted tunneling is investigated within the framework of
one-dimensional integrable systems. We present a systematic recipe, based on
Hamiltonian normal forms, to construct one-dimensional integrable models that
exhibit resonance island chain structures with accurately controlled sizes and
positions of the islands. Using complex classical trajectories that evolve
along suitably defined paths in the complex time domain, we construct a
semiclassical theory of the resonance-assisted tunneling process. This
semiclassical approach yields a compact analytical expression for
tunneling-induced level splittings which is found to be in very good agreement
with the exact splittings obtained through numerical diagonalisation.
