The path integral representation for a system of N non-relativistic particles
on the plane, interacting through a Chern-Simons gauge field, is obtained from
the operator formalism. An effective interaction between the particles appears,
generating the usual Aharonov-Bohm phases. The spin-statistics relation is also
considered.
