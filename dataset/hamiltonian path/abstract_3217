The phase and amplitude responses of a narrow-band optical filter are
measured simultaneously using a microwave network analyzer. The measurement is
based on an interferometric arrangement to split light into two paths and then
combine them. In one of the two paths, a Mach-Zehnder modulator generates two
tones without carrier and the narrow-band optical filter just passes through
one of the tones. The temperature and environmental variations are removed by
separated phase and amplitude averaging. The amplitude and phase responses of
the optical filter are measured to the resolution and accuracy of the network
analyzer.
