We give an outlook, how to realize the ideas of complex scaling from
Grothaus, Vogel and Streit to phase space path integrals in the framework of
White Noise Analysis. The idea of this scaling method goes back to Doss.
Therefore we extend the concept complex scaling to scaling with suitable
bounded operators.
