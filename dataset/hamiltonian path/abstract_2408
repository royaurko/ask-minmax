We derive a spin-dependent Hamiltonian that captures the symmetry of the zone
edge states in silicon. We present analytical expressions of the spin-dependent
states and of spin relaxation due to electron-phonon interactions in the
multivalley conduction band. We find excellent agreement with experimental
results. Similar to the usage of the Kane Hamiltonian in direct band-gap
semiconductors, the new Hamiltonian can be used to study spin properties of
electrons in silicon.
