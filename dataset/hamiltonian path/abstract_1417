It is known that a linear hamiltonian system has too many invariant measures,
thus the problem of convergence to Gibbs measure has no sense. We consider
linear hamiltonian systems of arbitrary finite dimension and prove that, under
the condition that one distinguished coordinate is subjected to dissipation and
white noise, then, for almost any hamiltonians and almost any initial
conditions, there exists the unique limiting distribution. Moreover, this
distribution is Gibbsian with the temperature depending on the dissipation and
of the variance of the white noise.
