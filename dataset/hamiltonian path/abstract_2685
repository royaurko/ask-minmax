We calculate accurate critical parameters for a class of non-hermitian
Hamiltonians by means of the diagonalization method. We study three
one-dimensional models and two perturbed rigid rotors with PT symmetry. One of
the latter models illustrates the necessity of a more general condition for the
appearance of real eigenvalues that we also discuss here.
