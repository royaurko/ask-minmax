Homotopy connectedness theorems for complex submanifolds of homogeneous
spaces (sometimes referred to as theorems of Barth-Lefshetz type) have been
established by a number of contributors. Morse Theory on the space of paths lead to
an elegant proof of homotopy connectedness theorems for complex submanifolds of
Hermitian symmetric spaces. In this work we extend this proof to a larger class
of compact complex homogeneous spaces.
