In this paper, we give a new construction of resonant normal forms with a
small remainder for near-integrable Hamiltonians at a quasi-periodic frequency.
The construction is based on the special case of a periodic frequency, a
Diophantine result concerning the approximation of a vector by independent
periodic vectors and a technique of composition of periodic averaging. It
enables us to deal with non-analytic Hamiltonians, and in this first part we
will focus on Gevrey Hamiltonians and derive normal forms with an exponentially
small remainder. This extends a result which was known for analytic
Hamiltonians, and only in the periodic case for Gevrey Hamiltonians. As
applications, we obtain an exponentially large upper bound on the stability
time for the evolution of the action variables and an exponentially small upper
bound on the splitting of invariant manifolds for hyperbolic tori, generalizing
corresponding results for analytic Hamiltonians.
