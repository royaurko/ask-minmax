We determine the solution of the fractional spatial diffusion equation in
n-dimensional Euclidean space for a "free" particle by computing the
corresponding propagator. We employ both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
approaches which produce exact results for the case of jumps governed by
symmetric stable L\'{e}vy flights.
