We consider a geometric rough path associated with a fractional Brownian
motion with Hurst parameter $H\in]{1/4}, {1/2}[$. We give an approximation
result in a modulus type distance, up to the second order, by means of a
sequence of rough paths lying above elements of the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space.
