We newly apply the improved Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin(BFT) Hamiltonian method to
the O(3) nonlinear sigma model, and directly obtain the compact form of
nontrivial first class Hamiltonian by introducing the BFT physical fields.
Furthermore, following the BFV formalism, we derive the BRST invariant gauge
fixed Lagrangian through the standard path-integral procedure. Finally, by
introducing collective coordinates, we also study a semi-classical quantization
of soliton background to conclude that the spectrum of zero modes are unchanged
through the BFT procedure.
