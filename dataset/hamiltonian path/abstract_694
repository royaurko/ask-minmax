Given the two boson representation of the conformal algebra \hat W_\infty,
the second Hamiltonian structure of the KP hierarchy, I construct a
bi-Hamiltonian hierarchy for the two associated currents. The KP hierarchy
appears as a composite of this new and simpler system. The bi-Hamiltonian
structure of the new hierarchy gives naturally all the Hamiltonian structures
of the KP system.
