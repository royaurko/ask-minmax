Recently Scholtz and Geyer proposed a very efficient method to compute metric
operators for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians from Moyal products. We develop these
ideas further and suggest to use a more symmetrical definition for the Moyal
products, because they lead to simpler differential equations. In addition, we
demonstrate how to use this approach to determine the Hermitian counterpart for
a Pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We illustrate our suggestions with the
explicitly solvable example of the -x^4-potential and the ubiquitous harmonic
oscillator in a complex cubic potential.
