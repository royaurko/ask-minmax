We consider minisuperspace gravity system described by piecewise flat metric
discontinuous on three-dimensional faces (tetrahedra). There are infinite terms
in the Einstein action. However, starting from proper regularization, these
terms in the exponential of path integral result in pre-exponent factor with
$\delta$-functions requiring vanishing metric discontinuities. Thereby path
integral measure in Regge calculus is related to path integral measure in Regge
calculus where length of an edge is not constrained to be the same for all the
4-tetrahedra containing this edge, i.e. in Regge calculus with independent
4-tetrahedra. The result obtained is in accordance with our previous one
obtained from symmetry considerations.
