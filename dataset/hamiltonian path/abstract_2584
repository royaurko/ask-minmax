It is generally believed that the ground state of the ferromagnetic
Heisenberg-Dirac-Van Vleck Hamiltonians acting on s=1/2 spins of a lattice with
N sites has the maximal possible value of the total spin S=N/2 and is N+1 times
degenerate. We present a rigorous proof of this statement, independent of the
lattice dimension and topology.
