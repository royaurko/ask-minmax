The Hamilton-Jacobi method of constrained systems is discussed. The equations
of motion of a singular system with time dependent constraints are obtained as
total differential equations in many variables. The integrability conditions
for the relativistic particle in a plane wave lead us to obtain the canonical
phase-space coordinates with out using any gauge fixing condition. As a result
of the quantization, we obtain the Klein-Gordon theory for a particle in a
plane wave. The path integral quantization for this system is obtained using
the canonical path integral formulation method.
