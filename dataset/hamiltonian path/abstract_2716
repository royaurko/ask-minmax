It is well-known that if a symplectic integrator is applied to a Hamiltonian
system, then the modified equation, whose solutions interpolate the numerical
solutions, is again Hamiltonian. We investigate this property from the
variational side. We present a technique to construct a Lagrangian for the
modified equation from the discrete Lagrangian of a variational integrator.
