In this paper we establish some spectral conditions for a graph to be
Hamilton-connected in terms of the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix or
the signless Laplacian of the graph or its complement. For the existence of
Hamiltonian paths or cycles in a graph, we also give a sufficient condition by
the signless Laplacian spectral radius.
