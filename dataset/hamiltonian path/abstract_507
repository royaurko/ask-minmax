Fix two lattice paths P and Q from (0,0) to (m,r) that use East and North
steps with P never going above Q. We show that the lattice paths that go from
(0,0) to (m,r) and that remain in the region bounded by P and Q can be
identified with the bases of a particular type of transversal matroid, which we
call a lattice path matroid. We consider a variety of enumerative aspects of
these matroids and we study three important matroid invariants, namely the
Tutte polynomial and, for special types of lattice path matroids, the
characteristic polynomial and the beta invariant. In particular, we show that
the Tutte polynomial is the generating function for two basic lattice path
statistics and we show that certain sequences of lattice path matroids give
rise to sequences of Tutte polynomials for which there are relatively simple
generating functions. We show that Tutte polynomials of lattice path matroids
can be computed in polynomial time. Also, we obtain a new result about lattice
paths from an analysis of the beta invariant of certain lattice path matroids.
