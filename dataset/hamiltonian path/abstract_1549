Effective Hamiltonians governing the time evolution in a subspace of unstable
states can be found using more or less accurate approximations. A convenient
tool for deriving them is the evolution equation for a subspace of state space
sometime called the Krolikowski-Rzewuski (KR) equation. KR equation results
from the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the total system under considerations. We
will discuss properties of approximate effective Hamiltonians derived using KR
equation for $n$--particle, two particle and for one particle subspaces. In a
general case these affective Hamiltonians depend on time $t$. We show that at
times much longer than times at which the exponential decay take place the real
part of the exact effective Hamiltonian for the one particle subsystem (that is
the instantaneous energy) tends to the minimal energy of the total system when
$t \rightarrow \infty$ whereas the imaginary part of this effective Hamiltonian
tends to the zero as $t\rightarrow \infty$.
