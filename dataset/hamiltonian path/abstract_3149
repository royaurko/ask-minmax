We described a simple algorithm running in linear time for each fixed
constant $k$, that either establishes that the pathwidth of a graph $G$ is
greater than $k$, or finds a path-decomposition of $G$ of width at most
$O(2^{k})$. This provides a simple proof of the result by Bodlaender that many
families of graphs of bounded pathwidth can be recognized in linear time.
