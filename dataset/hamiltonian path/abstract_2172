We study the transport coefficients, damping rates and mean free paths of
soft fermion collective excitations in a hot fermion-gauge-scalar plasma with
the goal of understanding the main physical mechanisms that determine transport
of chirality in scenarios of non-local electroweak baryogenesis. The focus is
on identifying the different transport coefficients for the different branches
of soft collective excitations of the fermion spectrum. These branches
correspond to collective excitations with opposite ratios of chirality to
helicity and different dispersion relations. By combining results from the hard
thermal loop (HTL) resummation program with a novel mechanism of fermion
damping through heavy scalar decay, we obtain a robust description of the
different damping rates and mean free paths for the soft collective excitations
to leading order in HTL and lowest order in the Yukawa coupling. The space-time
evolution of wave packets of collective excitations unambiguously reveals the
respective mean free paths. We find that whereas both the gauge and scalar
contribution to the damping rates are different for the different branches, the
difference of mean free paths for both branches is mainly determined by the
decay of the heavy scalar into a hard fermion and a soft collective excitation.
We argue that these mechanisms are robust and are therefore relevant for
non-local scenarios of baryogenesis either in the Standard Model or extensions
thereof.
