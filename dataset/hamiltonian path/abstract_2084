The world-line (Fock-Feynman-Schwinger) representation is used for quarks in
arbitrary (vacuum and valence gluon) field to construct the relativistic
Hamiltonian. After averaging the Green's function of the white $q\bar q$ system
over gluon fields one obtains the relativistic Hamiltonian, which is matrix in
spin indices and contains both positive and negative quark energies. The role
of the latter is studied in the example of the heavy-light meson and the
standard einbein technic is extended to the case of the matrix Hamiltonian.
Comparison with the Dirac equation shows a good agreement of the results. For
arbitrary $q\bar q $ system the nondiagonal matrix Hamiltonian components are
calculated through hyperfine interaction terms. A general discussion of the
role of negative energy components is given in conclusion.
