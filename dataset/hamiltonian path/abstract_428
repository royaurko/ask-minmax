In this article, we derive the scalar parametrized Klein-Gordon equation from
the formal information theory framework. The least biased probability
distribution is obtained, and the scalar equation is recast in terms of a
Fokker-Planck equation in terms of the imaginary time, or a Schroedinger
equation for the proper time. This method yields the Green's function
parametrized by an evolution parameter. The derivation can then allow the use
of potentials as constraints along with the Hamiltonian or moments of the
evolution. The information theoretic, analogously the maximum entropy method,
also allows one to examine the possibility of utilizing generalized and
non-extensive statistics in the derivation. This approach yields non-linear
evolution in the parametrized Klein-Gordon partial differential equations.
Furthermore, we examine the Klein-Gordon equation in curved space-time, and we
compare our results to the results of Schwinger and Dewitt obtained from path
integral approaches.
