We present an algorithm for enumerating exactly the number of Hamiltonian
chains on regular lattices in low dimensions. By definition, these are sets of
k disjoint paths whose union visits each lattice vertex exactly once. The
well-known Hamiltonian circuits and walks appear as the special cases k=0 and
k=1 respectively. In two dimensions, we enumerate chains on L x L square
lattices up to L=12, walks up to L=17, and circuits up to L=20. Some results
for three dimensions are also given. Using our data we extract several
quantities of physical interest.
