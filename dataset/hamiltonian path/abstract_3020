We investigate the properties of two standard energy estimators used in
path-integral Monte Carlo simulations. By disentangling the variance of the
estimators and their autocorrelation times we analyse the dependence of the
performance on the update algorithm and present a detailed comparison of
refined update schemes such as multigrid and staging techniques. We show that a
proper combination of the two estimators leads to a further reduction of the
statistical error of the estimated energy with respect to the better of the two
without extra cost.
