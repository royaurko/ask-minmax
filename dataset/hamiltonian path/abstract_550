This paper explores the relationship between non-Markovian fully coupled
forward-backward stochastic systems and path-dependent PDEs. The definition of
classical solution for the path-dependent PDE is given within the framework of
functional It\^{o} calculus. Under mild hypotheses, we prove that the
forward-backward stochastic system provides the unique classical solution to
the path-dependent PDE.
