The U(1) Calogero Sutherland Model (CSM) with anti-periodic boundary
condition is studied. The Hamiltonian is reduced to a convenient form by
similarity transformation. The matrix representation of the Hamiltonian acting
on a partially ordered state space is obtained in an upper triangular form.
Consequently the diagonal elements become the energy eigenvalues.
