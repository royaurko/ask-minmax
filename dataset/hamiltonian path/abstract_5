This paper investigates given an assembly graph, find the possible
micronuclear sequences in terms of MDSs and IESs; which represent Hamiltonian
polygonal paths. We will consider the orientations of the assembly graph and
Hamiltonian polygonal path. To obtain a micronuclear sequence of this path, we
will compare orientation of the Hamiltonian polygonal path with respect to the
orientation of the assembly graph. We concentrate on two assembly graphs with
two 4-valent vertices. These Hamiltonian polygonal paths influence the type of
smoothings performed. There are two types of smoothings parallel and
non-parallel smoothing. We consider a micronuclear sequence after one smoothing
of a vertex.
