We apply the technique of Hamiltonian reduction for the construction of
three-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric mechanics specified by the
presence of a Dirac monopole. For this purpose we take the conventional ${\cal
N}=4$ supersymmetric mechanics on the four-dimensional conformally-flat spaces
and perform its Hamiltonian reduction to three-dimensional system. We formulate
the final system in the canonical coordinates, and present, in these terms, the
explicit expressions of the Hamiltonian and supercharges. We show that, besides
a magnetic monopole field, the resulting system is specified by the presence of
a spin-orbit coupling term. A comparison with previous work is also carried
out.
