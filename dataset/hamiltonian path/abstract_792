Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $\lambda_n(G)$ be the least
eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix of $G$. In this paper, we give sharp bounds
on the least eigenvalue of graphs without given pathes or cycles and determine
the extremal graphs. This result gives spectral conditions for the existence of
specified paths and cycles in graphs.
