Because of unboundedness of the general relativity action, Euclidean version
of the path integral in general relativity requires definition. Area tensor
Regge calculus is considered in the representation with independent area tensor
and finite rotation matrices. Being integrated over rotation matrices the path
integral measure in area tensor Regge calculus is rewritten by moving
integration contours to complex plain so that it looks as that one with
effective action in the exponential with positive real part. We speculate that
positivity of the measure can be expected in the most part of range of
variation of area tensors.
