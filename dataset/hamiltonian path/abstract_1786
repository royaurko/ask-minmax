The Higgs vacuum is a kind of medium. In any medium one generally expects
sound waves for sufficiently long wavelengths (>> mean free path). I briefly
describe how the broken-symmetry vacuum can be viewed as a Bose-Einstein
condensate of `phion' particles. This picture yields a natural notion of the
`mean free path'. I speculate that this is at the millimeter-centimeter scale.
