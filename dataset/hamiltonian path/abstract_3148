The boundary conditions corresponding to the Matsubara formalism for the $T >
0$ partition function may be introduced as {\em constraints} in the path
integral for the vacuum amplitude. We implement those constraints with
time-independent Lagrange multipliers and, by integrating out the original
fields, we obtain an alternative representation for the partition function, in
terms of the Lagrange multipliers as dynamical fields. The resulting functional
integral has the appealing property of involving only $d$-dimensional, {\em
time independent} fields, and looks like a nonlocal version of the classical
partition function. We develop this formalism within the context of the scalar
and Dirac fields.
