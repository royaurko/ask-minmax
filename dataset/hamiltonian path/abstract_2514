We review a formulation of a renormalization-group scheme for Hamiltonian
systems with two degrees of freedom. We discuss the renormalization flow on the
basis of the continued fraction expansion of the frequency. The goal of this
approach is to understand universal scaling behavior of critical invariant
tori.
