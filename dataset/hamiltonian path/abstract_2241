We present a new way to compute thermodynamical observables on the lattice.
We compute excited states and thermodynamical functions in the scalar model via
the Monte Carlo Hamiltonian technique. We find agreement with standard
Lagrangian lattice calculations, but observe lesser fluctuations in the results
from the MC Hamiltonian.
