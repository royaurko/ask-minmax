The requirement of Hermiticity of a Quantum Mechanical Hamiltonian, for the
description of physical processes with real eigenvalues which has been
challenged notably by Carl Bender, is examined for the case of a Fock space
Hamilitonian which is bilinear in two creation and destruction operators. An
interpretation of this model as a Schr\"odinger operator leads to an
identification of the Hermitian form of the Hamiltonian as the Landau model of
a charged particle in a plane, interacting with a constant magnetic field at
right angles to the plane. When the parameters of the Hamiltonian are suitably
adjusted to make it non-Hermitian, the model represents two harmonic
oscillators at right angles interacting with a constant magnetic field in the
third direction, but with a pure imaginary coupling, and real energy
eigenvalues. It is now ${\cal PT}$ symmetric. Multiparticle states are
investigated.
