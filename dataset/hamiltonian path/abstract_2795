Starting from the temporal gauge Hamiltonian for classical pure Yang-Mills
theory with the gauge group SU(2) a canonical transformation is initiated by
parametrising the Gauss law generators with three new canonical variables. The
construction of the remaining variables of the new set proceeds through a
number of intermediate variables in several steps, which are suggested by the
Poisson bracket relations and the gauge transformation properties of these
variables. The unconstrained Hamiltonian is obtained from the original one by
expressing it in the new variables and then setting the Gauss law generators to
zero. This Hamiltonian turns out to be local and it decomposes into a finite
Laurent series in powers of the coupling constant.
