We have studied the evolution of the shell structure of nuclei near the
neutron drip line in the Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) theory with the
vector self-coupling of omega meson. The experimental data on the shell effects
about the waiting-point nucleus $^{80}$Zn are reproduced successfully. It is
shown that the shell effects at N=82 near the r-process path remain strong. A
quenching exhibited by the HFB+SkP approach is shown not to be compatible with
the available data.
