We show that the notion of generalized Lenard chains naturally allows
formulation of the theory of multi-separable and superintegrable systems in the
context of bi-Hamiltonian geometry. We prove that the existence of generalized
Lenard chains generated by a Hamiltonian function defined on a four-dimensional
\omega N manifold guarantees the separation of variables. As an application, we
construct such chains for the H\'enon-Heiles systems and for the classical
Smorodinsky-Winternitz systems. New bi-Hamiltonian structures for the Kepler
potential are found.
