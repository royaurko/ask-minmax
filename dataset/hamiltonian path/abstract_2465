We construct integrable and superintegrable Hamiltonian systems using the
realizations of four dimensional real Lie algebras as a symmetry of the system
with the phase space R4 and R6. Furthermore, we construct some integrable and
superintegrable Hamiltonian systems for which the symmetry Lie group is also
the phase space of the system.
