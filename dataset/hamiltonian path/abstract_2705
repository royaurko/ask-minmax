In this paper, we prove the main conjecture on $g$-areas that was announced
by the first contributor in 2004. It states that the $g$-area of any Hamiltonian
diffeomorphism $\phi$ is equal to the positive Hofer distance between $\phi$
and the subspace of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms that can be expressed as a
product of at most $g$ commutators.
