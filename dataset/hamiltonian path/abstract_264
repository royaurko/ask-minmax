We investigate the mixing of different shapes in the A~70 region using the
adiabatic self-consistent collective method in a rotating nuclei. The
calculation is done for 68^Se and 72-78^Kr which are known to show
oblate-prolate shape coexistence at low angular momentum. A
pairing-plus-quadrupole Hamiltonian, which is known to reproduce reproduce the
structure nuclei in this mass region, is used. We calculate the collective path
between the oblate and prolate minima and discuss how the collective behaviour
of the system changes with increasing angular momentum.
