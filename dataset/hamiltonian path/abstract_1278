Let $G=(V,E)$ be any undirected graph on $V$ vertices and $E$ edges. A path
$\textbf{P}$ between any two vertices $u,v\in V$ is said to be $t$-approximate
shortest path if its length is at most $t$ times the length of the shortest
path between $u$ and $v$. We consider the problem of building a compact data
structure for a given graph $G$ which is capable of answering the following
query for any $u,v,z\in V$ and $t>1$:
  Report $t$-approximate shortest path between $u$ and $v$ when vertex $z$
fails
  We present data structures for the single source as well all-pairs versions
of this problem. Our data structures guarantee optimal query time. Most
impressive feature of our data structures is that their size {\em nearly} match
the size of their best static counterparts.
