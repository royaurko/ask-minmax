Within path sampling framework, we show that probability distribution
divergences, such as the Chernoff information, can be estimated via
thermodynamic integration. The Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution pertaining to
different Hamiltonians is implemented to derive tempered transitions along the
path, linking the distributions of interest at the endpoints. Under this
perspective, a geometric approach is feasible, which prompts intuition and
facilitates tuning the error sources. Additionally, there are direct
applications in Bayesian model evaluation. Existing marginal likelihood and
Bayes factor estimators are reviewed here along with their stepping-stone
sampling analogues. New estimators are presented and the use of compound paths
is introduced.
