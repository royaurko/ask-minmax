Resistivity of metals is commonly observed either to 'escalate' beyond the
Ioffe-Regel limit (mean free path l equal to lattice constant a) or to
'saturate' at this point. It is argued that neither behavior is
well-understood, and that 'escalation' is not necessarily more mysterious than
'saturation.'
