The coupling of non-relativistic anyons (called exotic particles) to an
electromagnetic field is considered. Anomalous coupling is introduced by adding
a spin-orbit term to the Lagrangian. Alternatively, one has two Hamiltonian
structures, obtained by either adding the anomalous term to the Hamiltonian, or
by redefining the mass and the NC parameter. The model can also be derived from
its relativistic counterpart.
