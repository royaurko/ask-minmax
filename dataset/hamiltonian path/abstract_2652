Finding the number 2H6 of directed Hamiltonian cycles in 6-cube is problem 43
in Section 7.2.1.1 of Knuth's ' The Art of Computer Programming'; various
proposed estimates are surveyed below. We computed exact value:
H6=14,754,666,508,334,433,250,560=6*2^4*217,199*1,085,989*5,429,923. Also the
number Aut6 of those cycles up to automorphisms of 6-cube was computed as
