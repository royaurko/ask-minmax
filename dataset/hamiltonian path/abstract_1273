When studying stochastic processes, it is often fruitful to have an
understanding of several different notions of regularity. One such notion is
the optimal H\"older exponent obtainable under reparametrization. In this
paper, we show that the chordal SLE_kappa path in the unit disk for kappa less
than or equal to 4 can be reparametrized to be H\"older continuous of any order
up to 1/(1+kappa/8).
  From this result, we obtain that the Young integral is well defined along
such SLE paths with probability one, and hence that SLE admits a path-wise
notion of integration. This allows for us to consider the expected signature of
SLE, as defined in rough path theory, and to give a precise formula for its
first three gradings.
  The main technical result required is a uniform bound on the probability that
a SLE crosses an annulus k-distinct times.
