We use an instanton approximation to the continuous-time spin coherent-state
path integral to obtain the tunnel splitting of classically degenerate ground
states. We show that provided the fluctuation determinant is carefully
evaluated, the path integral expression is accurate to order O(1/j). We apply
the method to the LMG model and to the molecular magnet Fe_8 in a transverse
field.
