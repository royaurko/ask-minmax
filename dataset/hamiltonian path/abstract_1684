We describe, for the first time, a completely rigorous homotopy
(path--following) algorithm (in the Turing machine model) to find approximate
zeros of systems of polynomial equations. If the coordinates of the input
systems and the initial zero are rational our algorithm involves only rational
computations and if the homotopy is well posed an approximate zero with integer
coordinates of the target system is obtained. The total bit complexity is
linear in the length of the path in the condition metric, and polynomial in the
logarithm of the maximum of the condition number along the path, and in the
size of the input.
