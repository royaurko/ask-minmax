In 1990, Hendry conjectured that every Hamiltonian chordal graph is cycle
extendible; that is, the vertices of any non-Hamiltonian cycle are contained in
a cycle of length one greater. We disprove this conjecture by constructing
counterexamples on $n$ vertices for any $n \geq 15$. Furthermore, we show that
there exist counterexamples where the ratio of the length of a non-extendible
cycle to the total number of vertices can be made arbitrarily small. We then
consider cycle extendibility in Hamiltonian chordal graphs where certain
induced subgraphs are forbidden, notably $P_n$ and the bull.
