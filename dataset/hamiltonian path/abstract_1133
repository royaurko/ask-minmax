Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations often use mechanisms called
thermostats to regulate the temperature. A Hamiltonian is presented for the
case of the isoenergetic (constant internal energy) thermostat corresponding to
a tunable isokinetic (constant kinetic energy) thermostat, for which a
Hamiltonian has recently been given.
