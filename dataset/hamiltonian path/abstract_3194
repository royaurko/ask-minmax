The SU(1,1) coherent states for a relativistic model of the linear singular
oscillator are considered. The corresponding partition function is evaluated.
The path integral for the transition amplitude between SU(1,1) coherent states
is given. Classical equations of the motion in the generalized curved phase
space are obtained. It is shown that the use of quasiclassical Bohr-Sommerfeld
quantization rule yields the exact expression for the energy spectrum.
