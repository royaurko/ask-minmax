We consider a system of trapped spinless bosons interacting with a repulsive
potential and subject to rotation. In the limit of rapid rotation and small
scattering length, we rigorously show that the ground state energy converges to
that of a simplified model Hamiltonian with contact interaction projected onto
the Lowest Landau Level. This effective Hamiltonian models the bosonic analogue
of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE). For a fixed number of particles,
we also prove convergence of states; in particular, in a certain regime we show
convergence towards the bosonic Laughlin wavefunction. This is the first
rigorous justification of the effective FQHE Hamiltonian for rapidly rotating
Bose gases. We review previous results on this effective Hamiltonian and
outline open problems.
