Probabilistic sampling methods have become very popular to solve single-shot
path planning problems. Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) in particular
have been shown to be very efficient in solving high dimensional problems. Even
though several RRT variants have been proposed to tackle the dynamic replanning
problem, these methods only perform well in environments with infrequent
changes. This paper addresses the dynamic path planning problem by combining
simple techniques in a multi-stage probabilistic algorithm. This algorithm uses
RRTs as an initial solution, informed local search to fix unfeasible paths and
a simple greedy optimizer. The algorithm is capable of recognizing when the
local search is stuck, and subsequently restart the RRT. We show that this
combination of simple techniques provides better responses to a highly dynamic
environment than the dynamic RRT variants.
