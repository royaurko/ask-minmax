We consider a quasi-linear Hamiltonian system with one and a half degrees of
freedom. The Hamiltonian of this system differs by a small, $\sim\varepsilon$,
perturbing term from the Hamiltonian of a linear oscillatory system. We
consider passage through a resonance: the frequency of the latter system slowly
changes with time and passes through 0. The speed of this passage is of order
of $\varepsilon$. We provide asymptotic formulas that describe effects of
passage through a resonance with an accuracy $O(\varepsilon^{\frac32})$. This
is an improvement of known results by Chirikov (1959), Kevorkian (1971, 1974)
and Bosley (1996). The problem under consideration is a model problem that
describes passage through an isolated resonance in multi-frequency quasi-linear
Hamiltonian systems.
