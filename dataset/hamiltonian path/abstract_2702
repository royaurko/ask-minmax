In this paper, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a
stationary mean field game model introduced by J.-M. Lasry and P.-L. Lions.
This model features a quadratic Hamiltonian with possibly singular congestion
effects. Thanks to a new class of a-priori bounds, combined with the
continuation method, we prove the existence of smooth solutions in arbitrary
dimensions.
