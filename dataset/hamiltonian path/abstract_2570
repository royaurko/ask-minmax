We prove the following three results in Hamiltonian dynamics.
  1. The Weinstein conjecture holds true for every displaceable hypersurface of
contact type. 2. Every magnetic flow on a closed Riemannian manifold has
contractible closed orbits for a dense set of small energies. 3. Every closed
Lagrangian submanifold of an arbitrary symplectic manifold whose fundamental
group injects and which admits a Riemannian metric without closed geodesics has
the intersection property.
