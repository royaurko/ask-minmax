We demonstrate that parastatistics can be quantized using path integrals by
calculating the generating functionals for time-ordered products of both free
and interacting parabose and parafermi fields in terms of path integrals. We
also give a convenient form of the commutation relations for the Green
components of the parabose and parafermi operators in both the canonical and
path integral formalisms.
