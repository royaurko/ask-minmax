We want to investigate 'spaces' where paths have a 'weight', or 'cost',
expressing length, duration, price, energy, etc. The weight function is not
assumed to be invariant up to path-reversion. Thus, 'weighted algebraic
topology' can be developed as an enriched version of directed algebraic
topology, where illicit paths are penalised with an infinite cost, and the
licit ones are measured. Its algebraic counterpart will be 'weighted algebraic
structures', equipped with a sort of directed seminorm.
  In the fundamental weighted category of a generalised metric space,
introduced here, each homotopy class of paths has a weight (or seminorm), which
is subadditive with respect to composition. We also study a more general
setting, spaces with weighted paths, which has finer quotients and strong links
with noncommutative geometry. Weighted homology of weighted cubical sets has
already been developed in a previous work, with similar results.
