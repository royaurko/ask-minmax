We consider the optimal conduction path of the one-dimensional variable-range
hopping problem. We describe a hierarchical procedure for constructing the path
which is in excellent agreement with numerical results obtained from a
percolation approach. The advantage of the hierarchical construction is that it
is easier to analyse. We show that the distribution of hopping lengths is well
approximated by a model for the repeated breaking of a stick at its weakest
point, until the fragments are too strong to be broken.
