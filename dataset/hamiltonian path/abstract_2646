We show that the Aubry sets, the Ma\~{n}\'{e} sets, Mather's barrier
functions are the same for two commuting autonomous Tonelli Hamiltonians. We
also show the quasi-linearity of $\alpha$-functions from the dynamical point of
view and the existence of common $C^{1,1}$ critical subsolution for their
associated Hamilton-Jacobi equations.
