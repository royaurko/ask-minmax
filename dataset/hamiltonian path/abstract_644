We present the path integral formulation of a broad class of generalized
diffusion processes. Employing the path integral we derive exact expressions
for the path probability densities and joint probability distributions for the
class of processes under consideration. We show that Continuous Time Random
Walks (CTRWs) are included in our framework. A closed expression for the path
probability distribution of CTRWs is found in terms of their waiting time
distribution as the solution of a Dyson equation. As the formalism naturally
includes the treatment of functionals a generalized Feynman-Kac formula is
derived.
