Using intermediate degree p mode frequency data sets for solar cycle 22, we
find that the frequency shifts and magnetic indices show a `hysteresis'
phenomenon. It is observed that the magnetic indices follow different paths for
the ascending and descending phases of the solar cycle, the descending path
always seems to follow a higher track than the ascending one. However, for the
radiative indices, the paths cross each other indicating phase reversal.
