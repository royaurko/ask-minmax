The topological invariants of gapped time reversal invariant lattice
superconductors are studied by mapping the superconducting mean field
Hamiltonian to a Bloch Hamiltonian. There is a single $Z_2 $ invariant in two
dimensions and four such invariants in three dimensions. We briefly discuss the
properties of states with non-trivial topological invariants.
