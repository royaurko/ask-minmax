The spin can be described in the star product formalism by extending the
bosonic Moyal product in the fermionic sector. The fermionic star product is
then the Clifford product of geometric algebra and it is possible to formulate
the fermionic star product formalism in analogy to the bosonic star product
formalism. For the fermionic star product description of spin, one can then
establish the relation to other approaches that describe spin with fermionic
variables, i.e. the operator formalism and the path integral formalism. It is
shown that the fermionic star product formalism and the fermionic path integral
formalism are related in analogy to their bosonic counterparts.
