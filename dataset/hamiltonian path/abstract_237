An integrable Anderson-like impurity model in a correlated host is derived
from a gl(2$|$1)-symmetric transfer matrix by means of the
Quantum-Inverse-Scattering-Method (QISM). Using the Quantum Transfer Matrix
technique, free energy contributions of both the bulk and the impurity are
calculated exactly. As a special case, the limit of a localized moment in a
free bulk (Kondo limit) is performed in the Hamiltonian and in the free energy.
In this case, high- and low-temperature scales are calculated with high
accuracy.
