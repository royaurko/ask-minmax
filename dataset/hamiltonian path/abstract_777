A general method for flexible control of the path of discretized light beams
in homogeneous waveguide lattices, based on longitudinal modulation of the
coupling constant, is theoretically proposed. As compared to beam steering and
refraction achievable in graded-index waveguide arrays, the proposed approach
enables to synthesize rather arbitrary target paths.
