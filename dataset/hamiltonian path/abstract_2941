If a Hamiltonian is PT symmetric, there are two possibilities: Either the
eigenvalues are entirely real, in which case the Hamiltonian is said to be in
an unbroken-PT-symmetric phase, or else the eigenvalues are partly real and
partly complex, in which case the Hamiltonian is said to be in a
broken-PT-symmetric phase. As one varies the parameters of the Hamiltonian, one
can pass through the phase transition that separates the unbroken and broken
phases. This transition has recently been observed in a variety of laboratory
experiments. This paper explains the phase transition in a simple and intuitive
fashion and then describes an extremely elementary experiment in which the
phase transition is easily observed.
