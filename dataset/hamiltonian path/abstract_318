We apply strong-coupling perturbation theory to the QCD lattice Hamiltonian.
We begin with naive, nearest-neighbor fermions and subsequently break the
doubling symmetry with next-nearest-neighbor terms. The effective Hamiltonian
is that of an antiferromagnet with an added kinetic term for baryonic
"impurities," reminiscent of the t-J model of high-T_c superconductivity. As a
first step, we fix the locations of the baryons and make them static. Following
analyses of the t-J model, we apply large-N methods to obtain a phase diagram
in the (N_c,N_f) plane at zero temperature and baryon density. Next we study a
simplified U(3) toy model, in which we add baryons to the vacuum. We use a
coherent state formalism to write a path integral which we analyze with mean
field theory, obtaining a phase diagram in the (n_B,T) plane.
