In the first part of the paper, we introduce the Hamiltonian
$-\Delta-Z/\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, Z>0, as a selfadjoint operator in $L^2(R^2)$. A
general central point interaction combined with the two-dimensional
Coulomb-like potential is constructed and properties of the resulting
one-parameter family of Hamiltonians is studied in detail. The construction is
also reformulated in the momentum representation and a relation between the
coordinate and the momentum representation is derived. In the second part of
the paper we prove that the two-dimensional Coulomb-like Hamiltonian can be
derived as a norm resolvent limit of the Hamiltonian of a Hydrogen atom in a
planar slab as the width of the slab tends to zero.
