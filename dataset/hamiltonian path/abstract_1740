In this paper, we propose numerical methods for computing the boundary local
time of reflecting Brownian motion (RBM) in R3 and its use in the probabilistic
representation of the solution of the Laplace equation with the Neumann
boundary condition. Approximations of the RBM based on a walk-on-spheres (WOS)
and random walk on lattices are discussed and tested for sampling the RBM paths
and their applicability in finding accurate approximation of the local time and
discretization of the probabilistic formula. Numerical tests for several types
of domains (cube, sphere, and ellipsoid) have shown the convergence of the
numerical methods as the length of the RBM path and number of paths sampled
increase.
