Let v be a bounded function with bounded support in R^d, d>=3. Let x,y in
R^d. Let Z(t) denote the path integral of v along the path of a Brownian bridge
in R^d which runs for time t, starting at x and ending at y. As t->infty, it is
perhaps evident that the distribution of Z(t) converges weakly to that of the
sum of the integrals of v along the paths of two independent Brownian motions,
starting at x and y and running forever.Here we prove a stronger result, namely
convergence of the corresponding moment generating functions and of moments.
This result is needed for applications in physics.
