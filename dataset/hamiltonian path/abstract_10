Using a scheme proposed earlier we set up Hamiltonian path integral
quantization for a particle in two dimensions in plane polar coordinates.This
scheme uses the classical Hamiltonian, without any $O(\hbar^2)$ terms, in the
polar varivables. We show that the propagator satisfies the correct
Schr\"{o}dinger equation.
