This paper presents the results of a computational study related to the
path-geodesic correspondence in causal sets. For intervals in flat spacetimes,
and in selected curved spacetimes, we present evidence that the longest maximal
chains (the longest paths) in the corresponding causal set intervals
statistically approach the geodesic for that interval in the appropriate
continuum limit.
