The Hamiltonian of an atom with $N$ electrons and a fixed nucleus of infinite
mass between two parallel planes is considered in the limit when the distance
$a$ between the planes tends to zero. We show that this Hamiltonian converges
in the norm resolvent sense to a Schr\"{o}dinger operator acting effectively in
$L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2N})$ whose potential part depends on $a$. Moreover, we
prove that after an appropriate regularization this Schr\"{o}dinger operator
tends, again in the norm resolvent sense, to the Hamiltonian of a
two-dimensional atom (with the three-dimensional Coulomb potential-one over
distance), as $a\to 0$. This makes possible to locate the discrete spectrum of
the full Hamiltonian once we know the spectrum of the latter one. Our results
also provide a mathematical justification for the interest in the
two-dimensional atoms with the three-dimensional Coulomb potential.
