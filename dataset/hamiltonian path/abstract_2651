We present a method for obtaining the quasi-exact solutions of the Rabi
Hamiltonian in the framework of the asymptotic iteration method. The energy
eigenvalues, the eigenfunctions and the associated Bender-Dunne orthogonal
polynomials are deduced. The latter prove to have a nonpositive definite norm.
