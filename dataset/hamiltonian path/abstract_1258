We develop the formulation of the spin(SU(2)) coherent state path integrals
based on arbitrary fiducial vectors. The resultant action in the path integral
expression extensively depends on the vector; It differs from the conventional
one in that it has a generalized form having some additional terms. We also
study, as physical applications, the geometric phases associated with the
coherent state path integrals to find that new effects of the terms may appear
in experiments. We see that the formalism gives a clear insight into geometric
phases.
