A Lagrangian flow network is constructed for the atmospheric blocking of
eastern Europe and western Russia in summer 2010. We compute the most probable
paths followed by fluid particles which reveal the {\it Omega}-block skeleton
of the event. A hierarchy of sets of highly probable paths is introduced to
describe transport pathways when the most probable path alone is not
representative enough. These sets of paths have the shape of narrow coherent
tubes flowing close to the most probable one. Thus, even when the most probable
path is not very significant in terms of its probability, it still identifies
the geometry of the transport pathways.
