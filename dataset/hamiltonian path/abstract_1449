Exact canonically conjugate momenta Pi_{2mu} in quadrupole nuclear collective
motions are proposed. The basic idea lies in the introduction of a discrete
integral equation for the strict definition of canonically conjugate momenta to
collective variables phi_{2mu}. A part of our collective Hamiltonian, the
Pi_{2mu}-dependence of the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian, is given exactly.
Further, phi_{2mu}-dependence of the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian is also
given.
