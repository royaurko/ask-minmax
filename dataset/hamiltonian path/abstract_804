Using recent experimental information for 132Sn region, an empirical
Hamiltonian is obtained by some modifications of a Hamiltonian (CW5082)
originally derived from the 208Pb region. Shell model calculations with the new
Hamiltonian shows remarkable improvement in the predictive power when compared
with the available experimental results. It overcomes many limitations of the
CW5082 Hamiltonian in this region, specially for N>=84 isotones. The calculated
level spectra and B(E2) values with the new Hamiltonian, also compare well with
the available results calculated with the CD-Bonn and SKX Hamiltonians,
reflecting consistency in the wave function structure at least in the low-lying
regions. Interesting behaviour of effective charges is revealed in this region.
It is shown that a drastic reduction of proton effective charge is necessary
for obtaining B(E2) values for the N=84 isotones. Neutron effective charge is
found to be in the range (0.62 - 0.72)e. We predict the spectroscopic
properties of 135,136Sn not yet known experimentally. Further improvement of
the modified Hamiltonian is also initiated.
