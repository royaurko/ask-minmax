We discuss the existence of vertex disjoint path coverings with prescribed
ends for the $n$-dimensional hypercube with or without deleted vertices.
Depending on the type of the set of deleted vertices and desired properties of
the path coverings we establish the minimal integer $m$ such that for every $n
\ge m$ such path coverings exist. Using some of these results, for $k \le 4$,
we prove Locke's conjecture that a hypercube with $k$ deleted vertices of each
parity is Hamiltonian if $n \ge k +2.$ Some of our lemmas substantially
generalize known results of I. Havel and T. Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k. At the end of the
paper we formulate some conjectures supported by our results.
