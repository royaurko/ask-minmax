Orey suggested the definition of some index for Gaussian processes with
stationary increments which determines various properties of the sample paths
of this process. We give an extension of the definition of the Orey index for a
second order stochastic processes which may not have stationary increments and
estimate the Orey index for Gaussian process from discrete observations of its
sample paths.
