We derive a microscopic expression of the Clausius inequality for isothermal
open systems within the fundamental Hamiltonian dynamics. We also show the
positivity of the dissipative work, which is a path integral generalization of
the so-called relative entropy for the probability functionals of time forward-
and reversed- trajectories.
