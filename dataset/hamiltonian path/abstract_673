Hamiltonian integration methods for the Vlasov-Maxwell equations are
developed by a Hamiltonian splitting technique. The Hamiltonian functional is
split into five parts, i.e., the electrical energy, the magnetic energy, and
the kinetic energy in three Cartesian components. Each of the subsystems is a
Hamiltonian system with respect to the Morrison-Marsden-Weinstein Poisson
bracket and can be solved exactly. Compositions of the exact solutions yield
Poisson structure preserving, or Hamiltonian, integration methods for the
Vlasov-Maxwell equations, which have superior long-term fidelity and accuracy.
