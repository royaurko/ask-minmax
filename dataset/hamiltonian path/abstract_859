In this work, a MIMO detection problem is considered. At first, we derive the
Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) for arbitrary transmitted signals and
arbitrary time-correlation of the disturbance. Then, we investigate design
criteria for the transmitted waveforms in both power-unlimited and
power-limited systems and we study the interplay among the rank of the
optimized code matrix, the number of transmit diversity paths and the amount of
energy integrated along each path. The results show that increasing the rank of
the code matrix allows generating a larger number of diversity paths at the
price of reducing the average signal-to-clutter level along each path.
