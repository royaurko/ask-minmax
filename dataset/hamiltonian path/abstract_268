We study duality and local symmetries of closed bosonic string from the
perspectives of worldsheet approach in the phase space path integral formalism.
It is shown that the Ward identities reflecting the local symmetries associated
with massless excitations such as graviton and antisymmetric tensor can be cast
in a duality covariant form. It is shown how the manifestly O(d,d) invariant
Hamiltonian can be obtained in the Hassan-Sen toroidal compactification scheme,
d being the number of compact dimensions. It is proposed that massive excited
states possess a T-duality symmetry for constant (tensor) backgrounds. This
conjecture is verified for the first massive level.
