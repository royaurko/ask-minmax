We describe all fifth-order Hamiltonian operators in one dependent and one
independent variable that possess the momentum, i.e., for which there exists a
Hamiltonian associated with translation in the independent variable. Similar
results for first- and third-order Hamiltonian operators were obtained earlier
by Mokhov.
