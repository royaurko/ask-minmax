This note discusses some geometrically defined seminorms on the group
$\Ham(M, \omega)$ of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic
manifold $(M, \omega)$, giving conditions under which they are nondegenerate
and explaining their relation to the Hofer norm. As a consequence we show that
if an element in $\Ham(M, \omega)$ is sufficiently close to the identity in the
$C^{2}$-topology then it may be joined to the identity by a path whose Hofer
length is minimal among all paths, not just among paths in the same homotopy
class relative to endpoints. Thus, true geodesics always exist for the Hofer
norm. The main step in the proof is to show that a "weighted" version of the
nonsqueezing theorem holds for all fibrations over $S^2$ generated by
sufficiently short loops.Further, an example is given showing that the Hofer
norm may differ from the sum of the one sided seminorms.
