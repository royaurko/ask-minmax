We calculate the Feynman formula for the harmonic oscillator beyond and at
caustics by the discrete formulation of path integral. The extension has been
made by some contributors, however, it is not obtained by the method which we
consider the most reliable regularization of path integral. It is shown that
this method leads to the result with, especially at caustics, more rigorous
derivation than previous.
