We consider the Hamiltonian formulation of Yang-Mills theory in the Coulomb
gauge and apply the recently developed technique of Hamiltonian flows. We
formulate a flow equation for the color Coulomb potential which allows for a
scaling solution that results in an almost linearly rising confining potential.
