Recently a procedure by generalized density matrix (GDM) is proposed for
calculating a collective/bosonic Hamiltonian microscopically from the
shell-model Hamiltonian. In this work we examine the validity of the method by
comparing the GDM results with that of the exact shell-model diagonalization in
a number of models. It is shown that the GDM method reproduces the low-lying
collective states quite well, both for energies and transition rates, across
the whole region going from vibrational to gamma-unstable and deformed nuclei.
