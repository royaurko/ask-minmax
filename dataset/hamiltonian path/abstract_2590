In Lagrangian mechanics, Noether conservation laws including the energy one
are obtained similarly to those in field theory. In Hamiltonian mechanics,
Noether conservation laws are issued from the invariance of the Poincare-Cartan
integral invariant under one-parameter groups of diffeomorphisms of a
configuration space. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian conservation laws need not be
equivalent.
