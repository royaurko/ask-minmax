The past decade has seen the rapid development of the online newsroom. News
published online are the main outlet of news surpassing traditional printed
newspapers. This poses challenges to the production and to the consumption of
those news. With those many sources of information available it is important to
find ways to cluster and organise the documents if one wants to understand this
new system. A novel bio inspired approach to the problem of traversing the news
is presented. It finds Hamiltonian cycles over documents published by the
newspaper The Guardian. A Second Order Swarm Intelligence algorithm based on
Ant Colony Optimisation was developed that uses a negative pheromone to mark
unrewarding paths with a "no-entry" signal. This approach follows recent
findings of negative pheromone usage in real ants.
