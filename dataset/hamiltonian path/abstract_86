The correlation lengths of nonperturbative-nonconfining and confining
stochastic background Yang-Mills fields are obtained by means of a direct
analytic path-integral evaluation of the Green functions of the so-called one-
and two-gluon gluelumps. Numerically, these lengths turn out to be in a good
agreement with those known from the earlier, Hamiltonian, treatment of such
Green functions. It is also demonstrated that the correlation function of
nonperturbative-nonconfining fields decreases with the deviation of the path in
this correlation function from the straight-line one.
