In this paper, we develop results in the direction of an analogue of Sjamaar
and Lerman's singular reduction of Hamiltonian symplectic manifolds in the
context of reduction of Hamiltonian generalized complex manifolds (in the sense
of Lin and Tolman). Specifically, we prove that if a compact Lie group acts on
a generalized complex manifold in a Hamiltonian fashion, then the partition of
the global quotient by orbit types induces a partition of the Lin-Tolman
quotient into generalized complex manifolds. This result holds also for
reduction of Hamiltonian generalized K\"ahler manifolds.
