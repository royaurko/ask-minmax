The equivalence of correct Hamiltonian and naive Lagrangian (Faddeev--Popov)
path integral quantization (Matthews's theorem) is proven for gauge theories
with arbitrary effective interaction terms. Effective gauge-boson
self-interactions and effective interactions with scalar and fermion fields are
considered. This result becomes extended to effective gauge theories with
higher derivatives of the fields.
