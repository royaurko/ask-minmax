We obtain the bi-Hamiltonian structure of the super KP hierarchy based on the
even super KP operator $\Lambda = \theta^{2} + \sum^{\infty}_{i=-2}U_{i}
\theta^{-i-1}$, as a supersymmetric extension of the ordinary KP bi-Hamiltonian
structure. It is expected to give rise to a universal super $W$-algebra
incorporating all known extended superconformal $W_{N}$ algebras by reduction.
We also construct the super BKP hierarchy by imposing a set of anti-self-dual
constraints on the super KP hierarchy.
