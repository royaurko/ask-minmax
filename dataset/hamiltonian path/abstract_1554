The Hamiltonian formalism is extremely elegant and convenient to mechanics
problems. However, its application to the classical field theories is a
difficult task. In fact, you can set one to one correspondence between the
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian in the case of hyperregular Lagrangian. It is
impossible to do the same in gauge-invariant field theories. In the case of
irregular Lagrangian the Dirac Hamiltonian formalism with constraints is
usually used, and this leads to a number of certain difficulties. The paper
proposes a reformulation of the problem to the case of a field without sources.
This allows to use a symplectic Hamiltonian formalism. The proposed formalism
will be used by the contributors in the future to justify the methods of vector
bundles (Hamiltonian bundles) in transformation optics.
