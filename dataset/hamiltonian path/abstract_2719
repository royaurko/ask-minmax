We determine the universal central extension of the Lie algebra of
hamiltonian vector fields, thereby classifying its central extensions.
Furthermore, we classify the central extensions of the Lie algebra of
symplectic vector fields, of the Poisson Lie algebra, and of its compactly
supported version.
