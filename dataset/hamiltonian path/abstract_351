We present a comprehensive theory of the magnetization relaxation in a
Mn12-acetate crystal in the high-temperature regime (T>1 K), which is based on
phonon-assisted spin tunneling induced by quartic magnetic anisotropy and weak
transverse magnetic fields. The overall relaxation rate as function of the
longitudinal magnetic field is calculated and shown to agree well with
experimental data including all resonance peaks measured so far. The Lorentzian
shape of the resonances, which we obtain via a generalized master equation that
includes spin tunneling, is also in good agreement with recent data. We derive
a general formula for the tunnel splitting energy of these resonances. We show
that fourth-order diagonal terms in the Hamiltonian lead to satellite peaks. A
derivation of the effective linewidth of a resonance peak is given and shown to
agree well with experimental data. In addition, previously unknown spin-phonon
coupling constants are calculated explicitly. The values obtained for these
constants and for the sound velocity are also in good agreement with recent
data. We show that the spin relaxation in Mn12-acetate takes place via several
transition paths of comparable weight. These transition paths are expressed in
terms of intermediate relaxation times, which are calculated and which can be
tested experimentally.
