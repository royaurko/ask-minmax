The mean free path of phonons in superlattices is estimated. It is shown to
be strongly dependent on the superlattice period due to the Umklapp scattering
in subbands. It first falls with increasing the superlattice period until it
becomes comparable with the latter after what it rises back to the bulk value.
Similar behavior is expected of heat conductivity, which is proportional to the
mean free path.
