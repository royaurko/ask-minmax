A Hamiltonian cycle of a graph is a closed path that visits each site once
and only once. I study a field theoretic representation for the number of
Hamiltonian cycles for arbitrary graphs. By integrating out quadratic
fluctuations around the saddle point, one obtains an estimate for the number
which reflects characteristics of graphs well. The accuracy of the estimate is
verified by applying it to 2d square lattices with various boundary conditions.
This is the first example of extracting meaningful information from the
quadratic approximation to the field theory representation.
