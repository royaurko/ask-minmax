We specialize the radiation-reaction part of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM)
Hamiltonian for many non-spinning point-like bodies, calculated by Jaranowski
and Schaefer [1], to third-and-a-half post-Newtonian approximation to general
relativity, to binary systems. This Hamiltonian is used for the computation of
the instantaneous gravitational energy loss of a binary to 1PN reactive order.
We also derive the equations of motion, which include PN reactive terms via
Hamiltonian and Euler-Lagrangian approaches. The results are consistent with
the expressions for reactive acceleration provided by Iyer-Will formalism in
Ref. [2] in a general class of gauges.
