We show that the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is a
bi-Hamiltonian integrable system. We obtain the two Hamiltonian structures of
the theory from the ones of the supersymmetric two boson hierarchy through a
field redefinition. We also show how the two Hamiltonian structures of the
supersymmetric KdV equation can be derived from a Hamiltonian reduction of the
supersymmetric two boson hierarchy as well.
