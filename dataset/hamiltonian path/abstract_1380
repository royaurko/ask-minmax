We give an explicit example of an exactly solvable PT-symmetric Hamiltonian
with the unbroken PT symmetry which has one eigenfunction with the zero
PT-norm. The set of its eigenfunctions is not complete in corresponding Hilbert
space and it is non-diagonalizable. In the case of a regular Sturm-Liouville
problem any diagonalizable PT-symmetric Hamiltonian with the unbroken PT
symmetry has a complete set of positive CPT-normalazable eigenfunctions. For
non-diagonalizable
 Hamiltonians a complete set of CPT-normalazable functions is possible but the
functions belonging to the root subspace corresponding to multiple zeros of the
characteristic determinant are not eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian anymore.
