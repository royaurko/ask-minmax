Path integral solutions with kinetic coupling potentials $\propto p_1p_2$ are
evaluated. As examples I give a Morse oscillator, i.e., a model in molecular
physics, and the double pendulum in the harmonic approximation. The former is
solved by some well-known path integral techniques, whereas the latter by an
affine transformation.
