We perform a thorough analysis of the relationship between discrete and
series representation path integral methods, which are the main numerical
techniques used in connection with the Feynman-Kac formula. First, a new
interpretation of the so-called standard discrete path integral methods is
derived by direct discretization of the Feynman-Kac formula. Second, we
consider a particular random series technique based upon the Levy-Ciesielski
representation of the Brownian bridge and analyze its main implementations,
namely the primitive, the partial averaging, and the reweighted versions. It is
shown that the n=2^k-1 subsequence of each of these methods can also be
interpreted as a discrete path integral method with appropriate short-time
approximations. We therefore establish a direct connection between the discrete
and the random series approaches. In the end, we give sharp estimates on the
rates of convergence of the partial averaging and the reweighted
Levy-Ciesielski random series approach for sufficiently smooth potentials. The
asymptotic rates of convergence are found to be O(1/n^2), in agreement with the
rates of convergence of the best standard discrete path integral techniques.
