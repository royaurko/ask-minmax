The approach of path integral hadronization, applied to a quark-diquark toy
model, is used to derive an effective chiral meson-baryon Lagrangian. In this
approach the Goldberger-Treiman relation, found at the quark-meson level, is
re-established at the composite hadron level. For illu- strations,
electromagnetic low energy characteristics of composite nucleons are estimated.
