In these lectures we discuss some basic aspects of Hamiltonian formalism,
which usually do not appear in standard texbooks on classical mechanics for
physicists. We pay special attention to the procedure of Hamiltonian reduction
illustrating it by the examples related to Hopf maps. Then we briefly discuss
the supergeneralisation(s) of the Hamiltonian formalism and present some simple
models of supersymmetric mechanics on K\"ahler manifolds.
