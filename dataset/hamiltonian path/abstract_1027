The Batalin-Vilkovisky field-antifield action for systems with first-class
constraints is given explicitly in terms of the canonical hamiltonian, the
hamiltonian constraints and the first-order hamiltonian gauge structure
functions. It is shown that this action does not depend on the hamiltonian
gauge structure functions of higher orders. A method for finding the lagrangian
gauge structure tensors of all orders is presented. It is proven that the
lagrangian gauge structure tensors do not depend on the hamiltonian gauge
structure functions of second- or higher-orders.
