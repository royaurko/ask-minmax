In this thesis the first order formulation of generalized dilaton gravities
in two dimensions coupled to a Dirac fermion is considered. After a Hamiltonian
analysis of the gauge symmetries and constraints of the theory and fixing
Eddington-Finkelstein gauge by use of the Batalin-Vilkovisky-Fradkin method,
the system is quantized in the Feynman path integral approach. It turns out
that the path integral over the dilaton gravity sector can be evaluated
exactly, while in the matter sector perturbative methods are applied. The
gravitationally induced four-fermi scattering vertices as well as asymptotic
states are calculated, and -- as for dilaton gravities coupled to scalar fields
-- a ``virtual black hole'' is found to form as an intermediary geometric state
in scattering processes. The results are compared to the well-known scalar case
and evidence for bosonization in this context is found.
