A simple procedure is developed to simultaneously eliminate multiple
scattering contributions from two reflection electron energy loss spectra
(REELS) measured at different energies or for different experimental
geometrical configurations. The procedure provides the differential inverse
inelastic mean free path (DIIMFP) and the differential surface excitation
probability (DSEP). The only required input parameters are the differential
cross section for elastic scattering and a reasonable estimate for the
inelastic mean free path (IMFP). No prior information on surface excitations is
required for the deconvolution. The retrieved DIIMFP and DSEP can be used to
determine the dielectric function of a solid by fitting the DSEP and DIIMFP to
theory. Eventually, the optical data can be used to calculate the (differential
and total) inelastic mean free path and the surface excitation probability. The
procedure is applied to Fe, Co and Ni and the retrieved optical data as well as
the inelastic mean free paths and surface excitation parameters derived from it
are compared to values reported earlier in the literature. In all cases,
reasonable agreement is found between the present data and the earlier results,
supporting the validity of the procedure.
