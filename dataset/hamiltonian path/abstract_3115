We present several forms in which the BRST transformations of QCD in
covariant gauges can be cast. They can be non-local and even not manifestly
covariant. These transformations may be obtained in the path integral formalism
by non standard integrations in the ghost sector or by performing changes of
ghost variables which leave the action and the path integral measure invariant.
For different changes of ghost variables in the BRST and anti-BRST
transformations these two transformations no longer anticommute.
