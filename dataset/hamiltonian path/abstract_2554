We find an algorithm of numerical renormalization group for spin chain
models. The essence of this algorithm is orthogonal transformation of basis
states, which is useful for reducing the number of relevant basis states to
create effective Hamiltonian. We define two types of rotations and combine them
to create appropriate orthogonal transformation.
