We study the Hamiltonian equations of motion of a heavy tracer particle
interacting with a dense weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in the
classical (mean-field) limit. Solutions describing ballistic subsonic motion of
the particle through the condensate are constructed. We establish asymptotic
stability of ballistic subsonic motion.
