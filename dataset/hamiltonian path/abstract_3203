The Landau parameters of nuclear matter and neutron matter are extracted from
the Brueckner theory including three-body forces. The dynamical response
function to weak neutrino current is calculated in terms of the Landau
Parameters in the RPA limit. Then, the neutrino mean free path in neutron stars
is calculated for different conditions of density and temperature.
