One of the less well understood ambiguities of quantization is emphasized to
result from the presence of higher-order time derivatives in the Lagrangians.
This leads to the double-valued Hamiltonians reminiscent of a
supersymmetry-related partners. Two eligible elementary nonlinear models are
shown to admit a feasible quantization along these lines.
