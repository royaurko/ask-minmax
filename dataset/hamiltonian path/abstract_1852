We describe unicorn paths in the arc graph and show that they form 1-slim
triangles and are invariant under taking subpaths. We deduce that all arc
graphs are 7-hyperbolic. Considering the same paths in the arc and curve graph,
this also shows that all curve graphs are 17-hyperbolic, including closed
surfaces.
