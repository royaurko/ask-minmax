We consider super-Brownian motion whose historical paths reflect from each
other, unlike those of the usual historical super-Brownian motion. We prove
tightness for the family of distributions corresponding to a sequence of
discrete approximations but we leave the problem of uniqueness of the limit
open. We prove a few results about path behavior for processes under any limit
distribution. In particular, we show that for any $\gamma>0$, a "typical"
increment of a reflecting historical path over a small time interval $\Delta t$
is not greater than $(\Delta t)^{3/4 - \gamma}$.
