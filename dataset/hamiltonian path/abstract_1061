Our main purpose is to introduce the notion of trans-datum for quivers, and
apply it to the study of automorphism groups of path coalgebras and algebras.
We observe that any homomorphism of path coalgebras is uniquely determined by a
trans-datum, which is the basis of our work. Under this correspondence, we show
for any quiver $Q$ an isomorphism from $\aut(kQ^c)$ to $\Omega^*(Q)$, the group
of invertible trans-data from $Q$ to itself. We point out that the coradical
filtration gives to a tower of normal subgroups of $\aut(kQ^c)$ with all factor
groups determined. Generalizing this fact, we establish a Galois-like theory
for acyclic quivers, which gives a bijection between large subcoalgebras of the
path coalgebra and their Galois groups, relating large subcoalgebras of a path
coalgebra with certain subgroups of its automorphism group. The group
$\aut(kQ^c)$ is discussed by studying its certain subgroups, and the
corresponding trans-data are given explicitly. By the duality between reflexive
coalgebras and algebras, we therefore obtain some structural results of
$\aut(\hat{kQ^a})$ for a finite quiver $Q$, where $\hat{kQ^a}$ is the complete
path algebra. Moreover, we also apply these results to finite dimensional
elementary algebras and recover some classical results.
