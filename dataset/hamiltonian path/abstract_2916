The Dirac Hamiltonian with relativistic scalar and vector harmonic oscillator
potentials has been solved analytically in two limits. One is the spin limit
for which spin is an invariant symmetry of the the Dirac Hamiltonian and the
other is the pseudo-spin limit for which pseudo-spin is an invariant symmetry
of the the Dirac Hamiltonian. The spin limit occurs when the scalar potential
is equal to the vector potential plus a constant, and the pseudospin limit
occurs when the scalar potential is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to
the vector potential plus a constant. Like the non-relativistic harmonic
oscillator, each of these limits has a higher symmetry. For example, for the
spherically symmetric oscillator, these limits have a U(3) and pseudo-U(3)
symmetry respectively. We shall discuss the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of
these two limits and derive the relativistic generators for the U(3) and
pseudo-U(3) symmetry. We also argue, that, if an anti-nucleon can be bound in a
nucleus, the spectrum will have approximate spin and U(3) symmetry.
