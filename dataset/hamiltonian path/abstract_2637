The direct hamiltonization procedure applied to Nambu mechanical systems
proves that the Nambu mechanics is an usual mechanics described by only one
Hamiltonian. Thus a particular case of Hamiltonian mechanics. It is also proved
that any mechanical system described by the equation d{\bf r}/dt={\bf A(r)} is
a Nambu system.
