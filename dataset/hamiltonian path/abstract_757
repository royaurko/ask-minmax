We give a bijective proof of a conjecture of Regev and Vershik on the
equality of two multisets of hook numbers of certain skew-Young diagrams. The
bijection proves a result that is stronger and more symmetric than the original
conjecture, by means of a construction involving Dyck paths, a particular type
of lattice path.
