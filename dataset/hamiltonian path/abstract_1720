We consider efficient implementations of the generalized lasso dual path
algorithm of Tibshirani and Taylor (2011). We first describe a generic approach
that covers any penalty matrix D and any (full column rank) matrix X of
predictor variables. We then describe fast implementations for the special
cases of trend filtering problems, fused lasso problems, and sparse fused lasso
problems, both with X=I and a general matrix X. These specialized
implementations offer a considerable improvement over the generic
implementation, both in terms of numerical stability and efficiency of the
solution path computation. These algorithms are all available for use in the
genlasso R package, which can be found in the CRAN repository.
