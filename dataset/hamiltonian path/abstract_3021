Using the 'drift-diffusion-Langevin' equation, we have recently shown that
finite-frequency shot noise in diffusive mesoscopic conductors is very
sensitive to the ratio $\gamma \equiv L/\lee$ between the sample length $L$ and
the electron-electron mean free path $\lee$. In this work we present numerical
calculations of the noise at arbitrary value of $\gamma$. If coupled with
accurate noise measurements, the results presented here could serve as a new
and independent way of determining $\lee$ in a given sample.
