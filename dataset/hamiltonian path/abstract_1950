Large classes of multi-dimensional Gaussian processes can be enhanced with
stochastic Levy area(s). In a previous paper, we gave sufficient and
essentially necessary conditions, only involving variational properties of the
covariance. Following T. Lyons, the resulting lift to a "Gaussian rough path"
gives a robust theory of (stochastic) differential equations driven by Gaussian
signals with sample path regularity worse than Brownian motion.
  The purpose of this sequel paper is to establish convergence of
Karhunen-Loeve approximations in rough path metrics. Particular care is
necessary since martingale arguments are not enough to deal with third iterated
integrals. An abstract support criterion for approximately continuous Wiener
functionals then gives a description of the support of Gaussian rough paths as
the closure of the (canonically lifted) Cameron-Martin space.
