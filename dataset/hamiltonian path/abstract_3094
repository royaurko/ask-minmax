The recent data of the SLAC E-146 collaboration on the
Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect for bremsstrahlung from 8 and 25 GeV electrons
are analyzed within a rigorous light-cone path integral approach. Numerical
calculations have been carried out treating rigorously the Coulomb effects and
including the inelastic processes. Comparison with the experimental data is
performed taking into account multi-photon emission and photon absorption. For
most of the targets the theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with
the experimental data.
