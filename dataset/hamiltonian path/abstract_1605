We describe a new, surprisingly simple algorithm, that simulates exact sample
paths of a class of stochastic differential equations. It involves rejection
sampling and, when applicable, returns the location of the path at a random
collection of time instances. The path can then be completed without further
reference to the dynamics of the target process.
