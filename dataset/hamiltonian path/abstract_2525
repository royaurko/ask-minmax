An analytical expression for the supercurrent of a superconducting
single-electron transistor (SSET) is derived. The derivation is based on
analogy between the model Hamiltonian for E_J>E_C and a discrete,
one-dimensional harmonic oscillator (1DDHO). The resulting supercurrent is
nearly identical to the supercurrent obtained from a continuous harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonian.
