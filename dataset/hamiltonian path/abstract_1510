Marchesini showed that the Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian for Yang-Mills theories
is the loop operator. Jevicki and Rodrigues showed that the Fokker-Planck
Hamiltonian of some matrix models co\"\i ncides with temporal gauge
non-critical string field theory Hamiltonians constructed by Ishibashi and
Kawai (and their collaborators). Thus the loop operator for Yang-Mills theory
is the temporal gauge Hamiltonian for a noncritical string field theory, in
accord with Polyakov's conjecture. The consistency condition of the string
interpretation is the zigzag symmetry emphasized by Polyakov. Several aspects
of the noncritical string theory are considered, relating the string field
theory Hamiltonian to the worldsheet description.
