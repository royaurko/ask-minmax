We obtain a bi-Hamiltonian formulation for the Ostrovsky-Vakhnenko equation
using its higher order symmetry and a new transformation to the
Caudrey-Dodd-Gibbon-Sawada-Kotera equation. Central to this derivation is the
relation between Hamiltonian structures when dependent and independent
variables are transformed.
