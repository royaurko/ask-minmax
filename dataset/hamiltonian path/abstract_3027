We present high statistics data on the distribution of shortest path lengths
between two near-by points on the same cluster at the percolation threshold.
Our data are based on a new and very efficient algorithm. For $d=2$ they
clearly disprove a recent conjecture by M. Porto et al., Phys. Rev. {\bf E 58},
R5205 (1998). Our data also provide upper bounds on the probability that two
near-by points are on different infinite clusters.
