Recently, the behavior of different epidemic models and their relation both
to different types of geometries and to some biological models has been
revisited . Path equations representing the behavior of epidemic models and
their corresponding deviation vectors are examined. A comparison between paths
and their deviation vectors in Riemannian and Finslerian Geometries is
presented.
