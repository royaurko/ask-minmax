The existence of beyond mean field quasi-cycle oscillations in a simple
spatial model of predator prey interactions is derived from a path integral
formalism. The results agree substantially with those obtained from analysis of
similar models using system size expansions of the master equation. In all of
these analyses, the discrete nature of predator prey populations and finite
size effects lead to persistent oscillations in time, but spatial patterns fail
to form. The path integral formalism goes beyond mean field theory and provides
a focus on individual realizations of the stochastic time evolution of
population not captured in the standard master equation approach.
