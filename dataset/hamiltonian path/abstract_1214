The Hamiltonian structures of the incompressible ideal fluid, including
entropy advection, and magnetohydrodynamics are investigated by making use of
Dirac's theory of constrained Hamiltonian systems. A Dirac bracket for these
systems is constructed by assuming a primary constraint of constant density.
The resulting bracket is seen to naturally project onto solenoidal velocity
fields.
