We study the spectral flow of Landau-Robin hamiltonians in the exterior of a
compact domain with smooth boundary. This provides a method to study the
spectrum of the exterior Landau-Robin hamiltonian's dependence on the choice of
Robin data, even explaining the heuristics of how the spectrum of the Robin
problem asymptotically tends to the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem. The main
technical result concerns the continuous dependence of Landau-Robin
hamiltonians on the Robin data in the gap topology. The problem can be
localized to the compact boundary where the asymptotic behavior of the spectral
flow in some special cases can be described.
