The Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) scheme, which is an improved version of
Dirac quantization, is applied to the $CP^1$ model, and the compact form of a
nontrivial first-class Hamiltonian is directly obtained by introducing the BFT
physical fields. We also derive a BRST-invariant gauge fixed Lagrangian through
the standard path-integral procedure. Furthermore, performing collective
coordinate quantization we obtain energy spectrum of rigid rotator in the
$CP^1$ model. Exploiting the Hopf bundle, we also show that the $CP^1$ model is
exactly equivalent to the O(3) nonlinear sigma model at the canonical level.
