The Mori-Zwanzig projection formalism is widely used in studying systems with
many degrees of freedom. We used a system-bath Hamiltonian system to show that
the Mori's and Zwanzig's projection procedures are mutual limiting cases of
each other depending on the size of the projected Hilbert space. We also
derived the dynamic equations of collective coordinates of a Hamiltonian
system.
