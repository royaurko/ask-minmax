A path integral over trajectories of $2n$ fluid particles is identified with
a $2n$-th order correlation function of a passive scalar convected by
$d$-dimensional short-correlated multi-scale incompressible random velocity
flow. Strong intermittency of the scalar is described by means of an instanton
calculus (saddle point $+$ fluctuations about it) in the path integral at $n\gg
d$. Anomalous scaling exponent of the $2n$-th scalar's structural function is
found analytically.
