A three-parameter family of integrable quadratic Hamiltonians on $e(3)$ and
$so(4)$ is presented. When one of the parameters vanishes, the Hamiltonian
coincides with the Kowalevski Hamiltonian with the girostatic term. If the
other two parameters are equal to zero then the Hamiltonian reduces to a new
integrable case of the Kirchhoff equations found recently by the contributor.
