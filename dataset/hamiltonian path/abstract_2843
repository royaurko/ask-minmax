We derive an encoded universality representation for a generalized
anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian that contains cross-product terms in addition
to the usual two-particle exchange terms. The recently developed algebraic
approach is used to show that the minimal universality-generating encodings of
one logical qubit are based on three physical qubits. We show how to generate
both single- and two-qubit operations on the logical qubits, using suitably
timed conjugating operations derived from analysis of the commutator algebra.
The timing of the operations is seen to be crucial in allowing simplification
of the gate sequences for the generalized Hamiltonian to forms similar to that
derived previously for the symmetric (XY) anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian. The
total number of operations needed for a controlled-Z gate up to local
transformations is five. A scalable architecture is proposed.
