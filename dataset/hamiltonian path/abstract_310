Fiedler and Nikiforov gave sufficient conditions for the existence of
Hamilton paths and cycles in terms of spectral radii of a graph and its
complement, which stimulated much later works on this topic. The class of
claw-free graphs, which contains line graphs as a subclass, is an important
type of graphs. Motivated by Fiedler and Nikiforov's works, in this paper we
prove tight sufficient spectral conditions for Hamilton cycles in 2-connected
claw-free graphs and Hamilton paths in connected claw-free graphs. Our strategy
is to deduce spectral results from structural results, and main tools include
Ryj\'{a}cek's claw-free closure theory, Tur\'{a}n's theorem and a characterized
theorem of minimal 2-connected non-hamiltonian claw-free graphs due to Brousek,
together with some spectral inequalities.
