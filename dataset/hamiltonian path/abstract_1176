If an experimentalist wants to decide which one of n possible Hamiltonians
acting on an n dimensional Hilbert space is present, he can conjugate the time
evolution by an appropriate sequence of known unitary transformations in such a
way that the different Hamiltonians result in mutual orthogonal final states.
We present a general scheme providing such a sequence.
