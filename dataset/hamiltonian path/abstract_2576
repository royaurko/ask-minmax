We study several aspects of the regular deformations of completely integrable
systems. Namely, we prove the existence of a Hamiltonian normal form for these
deformations and we show the necessary and sufficient conditions a perturbation
has to satisfy in order for the perturbed Hamiltonian to be a first order
deformation.
