We study finite field dependent BRST-BFV transformations for dynamical
systems with first- and second-class constraints within the generalized
Hamiltonian formalism. We find explicitly their Jacobians and the form of a
solution to the compensation equation necessary for generating an arbitrary
finite change of gauge-fixing functionals in the path integral.
