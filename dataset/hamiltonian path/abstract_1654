As a general rule, differential equations driven by a multi-dimensional
irregular path $\Gamma$ are solved by constructing a rough path over $\Gamma$.
The domain of definition ? and also estimates ? of the solutions depend on
upper bounds for the rough path; these general, deterministic estimates are too
crude to apply e.g. to the solutions of stochastic differential equations with
linear coefficients driven by a Gaussian process with H\"older regularity
$\alpha < 1/2$. We prove here (by showing convergence of Chen's series) that
linear stochastic differential equations driven by analytic fractional Brownian
motion [7, 8] with arbitrary Hurst index $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ may be solved on
the closed upper halfplane, and that the solutions have finite variance.
