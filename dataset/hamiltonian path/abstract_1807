It is shown that every connected vertex-transitive graph of order $6p$, where
$p$ is a prime, contains a Hamilton path. Moreover, it is shown that, except
for the truncation of the Petersen graph, every connected vertex-transitive
graph of order $6p$ which is not genuinely imprimitive contains a Hamilton
cycle.
