In this paper, we consider the existence of infinitely many homoclinic
solutions for a class of subquadratic second-order Hamiltonian systems
$\ddot{u}-L(t)u+W_u(t,u)=0$, where $L(t)$ is unnecessarily positive definite.
Using the variant fountain theorem, we obtain a new result of infinitely many
homoclinic solutions for the second-order Hamiltonian systems.
