A dispersion-managed optical system with step-wise periodical variation of
dispersion is studied in a strong dispersion map limit in the framework of
path-averaged Gabitov-Turitsyn equation. The soliton solution is obtained by
iterating the path-averaged equation analytically and numerically. An efficient
numerical algorithm for obtaining of DM soliton shape is developed. The
envelope of soliton oscillating tails is found to decay exponentially in time
while the oscillations are described by a quadratic law.
