The Heisenberg picture for non-Hermitian but $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian
Hamiltonian systems is given. Two classes of general non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
are proposed, one is non-Hermitian and non-$PT$-symmetric and the other is
non-Hermitian but $PT$-symmetric. Their (first order) Heisenberg equations of
motion are highly non-trivially complex, however, the corresponding (second
order) equations of motion are shown to be real. The real closeness is
suggested as a new criterion, based on which the existence of real eigenvalues
for the two classes of general non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is determined. The
eigenfunctions can be obtained in terms of a similarity transformation. The
complementarity and compatibility on the real closeness and the $PT$ symmetry
are discussed.
