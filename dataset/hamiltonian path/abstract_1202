The system of semi-relativistic particles coupled to a scalar bose field is
investigated. A renormalized Hamiltonian is defined by subtracting a divergent
term from the total Hamiltonian. We consider taking the scaling limit and
removing the ultraviolet cutoffs simultaneously for the renormalized
Hamiltonian. By applying an abstract scaling limit theory on self-adjoint
operators, we derive the Yukawa potential as an effective potential of
semi-relativistic particles.
