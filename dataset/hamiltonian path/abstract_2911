The complete, missing, Hamiltonian treatment of the standard SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)
model with Grassmann-valued fermion fields in the Higgs phase is given. We
bypass the complications of the Hamiltonian theory in the Higgs phase,
resulting from the spontaneous symmetry breaking with the Higgs mechanism, by
studying the Hamiltonian formulation of the Higgs phase for the gauge
equivalent Lagrangian in the unitary gauge. A canonical basis of Dirac's
observables is found and the reduced physical Hamiltonian is evaluated. Its
self-energy part is nonlocal for the electromagnetic and strong interactions,
but local for the weak ones. Therefore, the Fermi 4-fermion interaction
reappears at the nonperturbative level.
