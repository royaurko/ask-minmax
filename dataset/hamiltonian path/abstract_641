This paper presents an approximation algorithm for finding a shortest path
between two points $s$ and $t$ in a weighted planar subdivision $\PS$. Each
face $f$ of $\PS$ is associated with a weight $w_f$, and the cost of travel
along a line segment on $f$ is $w_f$ multiplied by the Euclidean norm of that
line segment. The cost of a path which traverses across several faces of the
subdivision is the sum of the costs of travel along each face. Our algorithm
progreeses the discretized shortest path wavefront from source $s$, and takes
polynomial time in finding an $\epsilon$-approximate shortest path.
