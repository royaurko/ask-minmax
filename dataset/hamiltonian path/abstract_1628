We calculate the mean free path of protons and neutrons in symmetric and
asymmetric nuclear matter, based on microscopic in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross
sections. Those are obtained from calculations of the G-matrix including
relativistic "Dirac" effects. The dependence of the mean free path on energy
and isospin asymmetry is discussed. We conclude by suggesting possible ways our
microscopic predictions may be helpful in conjunction with studies of rare
isotopes.
