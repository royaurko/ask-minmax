A complexified von Roos Hamiltonian is considered and a Hermitian first-order
intertwining differential operator is used to obtain the related position
dependent mass $\eta$-weak-pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Using a
Liouvillean-type change of variables, the $\eta$-weak-pseudo-Hermitian von Roos
Hamiltonians H(x) are mapped into the traditional Schrodinger Hamiltonian form
H(q), where exact isospectral correspondence between H(x) and H(q) is obtained.
Under a user-friendly position dependent mass settings, it is observed that for
each exactly-solvable $\eta$-weak-pseudo-Hermitian reference-Hamiltonian
H(q)there is a set of exactly-solvable $\eta$-weak-pseudo-Hermitian isospectral
target-Hamiltonians H(x). A non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Scarf II and a
non-Hermitian periodic-type PT-symmetric Samsonov-Roy potentials are used as
reference models and the corresponding $\eta$-weak-pseudo-Hermitian isospectral
target-Hamiltonians are obtained.
