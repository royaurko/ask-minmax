We consider the cubic and quartic He'non-Heiles Hamiltonians with additional
inverse square terms, which pass the Painleve' test for only seven sets of
coefficients. For all the not yet integrated cases we prove the
singlevaluedness of the general solution. The seven Hamiltonians enjoy two
properties: meromorphy of the general solution, which is hyperelliptic with
genus two and completeness in the Painleve' sense (impossibility to add any
term to the Hamiltonian without destroying the Painleve' property).
