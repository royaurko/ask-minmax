Recently, asymptotic values of 2-color Ramsey numbers for loose cycles and
also loose paths were determined. Here we determine the 2-color Ramsey number
of 3-uniform loose paths when one of the paths is significantly larger than the
other: for every $n\geq \Big\lfloor\frac{5m}{4}\Big\rfloor$, we show that
$$R(\mathcal{P}^3_n,\mathcal{P}^3_m)=2n+\Big\lfloor\frac{m+1}{2}\Big\rfloor.$$
