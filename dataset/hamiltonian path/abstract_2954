Among theoretical issues in General Relativity the problem of constructing
its Hamiltonian formulation is still of interest. The most of attempts to
quantize Gravity are based upon Dirac generalization of Hamiltonian dynamics
for system with constraints. At the same time there exists another way to
formulate Hamiltonian dynamics for constrained systems guided by the idea of
extended phase space. We have already considered some features of this approach
in the previous MG12 Meeting by the example of a simple isotropic model. Now we
apply the approach to a generalized spherically symmetric model which imitates
the structure of General Relativity much better. In particular, making use of a
global BRST symmetry and the Noether theorem, we construct the BRST charge that
generates correct gauge transformations for all gravitational degrees of
freedom.
