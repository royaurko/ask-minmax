We present a unified analysis of single excitation vector models in 3D. We
show that there is a family of first order master actions related by duality
transformations which interpolate between the different models. We use a
Hamiltonian (2+1) analysis to show the equivalence of the self-dual and
topologically massive models with a covariant non local model which propagates
also a single massive excitation. It is shown how the non local terms appears
naturally in the path integral framework.
