In this article, we continue to investigate the application of Probability
Bracket Notation (PBN). We show that, under Special Wick Rotation (caused by
imaginary-time rotation), the Schrodinger equation of a conservative system and
its path integral in Dirac rotation are simultaneously shifted to the master
equation and its Euclidean path integral of an induced micro diffusion in PBN.
Moreover, by extending to General Wick Rotation and using the anti-Hermitian
wave-number operator, we execute the path integral in Dirac notation
side-by-side with the Euclidean path integral in PBN, and derive the Euclidean
Lagrangian of induced diffusions and Smoluchowski equation.
