We present a new approach to carry out non-adiabatic molecular dynamics to
study the carrier mobility in an organic monolayer. This approach allows the
calculation of a 4802 atom system for 825 fs in about three hours using 51,744
computer cores while maintaining a plane wave pseudopotential density
functional theory level accuracy for the Hamiltonian. Our simulation on a
pentathiophene butyric acid monolayer reveals a previously unknown new
mechanism for the carrier transport in such systems: the hole wave functions
are localized by thermo fluctuation induced disorder, while its transport is
via charge transfer during state energy crossing. The simulation also shows
that the system is not in thermo dynamic equilibrium in terms of adiabatic
state populations according to Boltzmann distribution. Our simulation is
achieved by introducing a linear time dependence approximation of the
Hamiltonian within a fs time interval, and by using the charge patching method
to yield the Hamiltonian, and overlapping fragment method to diagonalize the
Hamiltonian matrix.
