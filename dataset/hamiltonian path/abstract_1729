We consider noise-induced transition paths in randomly perturbed dynami- cal
systems on a smooth manifold. The classical Freidlin-Wentzell large devia- tion
theory in Euclidean spaces is generalized and new forms of action functionals
are derived in the spaces of functions and the space of curves to accommodate
the intrinsic constraints associated with the manifold. Numerical meth- ods are
proposed to compute the minimum action paths for the systems with constraints.
The examples of conformational transition paths for a single and double rod
molecules arising in polymer science are numerically investigated.
