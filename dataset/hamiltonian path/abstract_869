We write a space-time Feynman path integral representation for scattered
elastic wave fields from a weakly compact supported anisotropic
non-homogeneity.Replacement by a new version where We (I!) propose a new
tomographic inversion methodology based solely in the wave sampling of the Ray
paths through Monte Carlo path integral sampling Holding thus great
potentiality for Navy's advanced Sonar detection .
