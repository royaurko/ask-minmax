To distinguish between regular and chaotic orbits in Hamiltonian systems, the
Global Symplectic Integrator (GSI) has been introduced, based on the symplectic
integration of both Hamiltonian equations of motion and variational equations.
In the present contribution, we show how to compute efficiently the MEGNO
indicator jointly with the GSI. Moreover, we discuss the choice of symplectic
integrator, in fact we point out that a particular attention has to be paid to
the structure of the Hamiltonian system associated to the variational
equations. The performances of our method is illustrated through the study of
the Arnold diffusion problem.
