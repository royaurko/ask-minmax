An efficient computational methodology is used to explore charge transport
properties in chemically-modified (and randomly disordered) graphene-based
materials. The Hamiltonians of various complex forms of graphene are
constructed using tight-binding models enriched by first-principles
calculations. These atomistic models are further implemented into a real-space
order-N Kubo-Greenwood approach, giving access to the main transport length
scales (mean free paths, localization lengths) as a function of defect density
and charge carrier energy. An extensive investigation is performed for epoxide
impurities with specific discussions on both the existence of a minimum
semi-classical conductivity and a crossover between weak to strong localization
regime. The 2D generalization of the Thouless relationship linking transport
length scales is here illustrated based on a realistic disorder model.
