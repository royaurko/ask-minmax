We construct reflection and translation operators on the Hilbert space
corresponding to the torus by projecting them from the plane. These operators
are shown to have the same group properties as their analogue on the plane. The
decomposition of operators in the basis of reflections corresponds to the Weyl
or center representation, conjugate to the chord representation which is based
on quantized translations. Thus, the symbol of any operator on the torus is
derived as the projection of the symbol on the plane. The group properties
allow us to derive the product law for an arbitrary number of operators in a
simple form. The analogy between the center and the chord representations on
the torus to those on the plane is then exploited to treat Hamiltonian systems
defined on the torus and to formulate a path integral representation of the
evolution operator. We derive its semiclassical approximation.
