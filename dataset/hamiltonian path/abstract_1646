The geometrical representation of the path integral reduction Jacobian
obtained in the problem of the path integral quantization of a scalar particle
motion on a smooth compact Riemannian manifold with the given free isometric
action of the compact semisimple Lie group has been found for the case when the
local reduced motion is described by means of dependent coordinates. The result
is based on the scalar curvature formula for the original manifold which is
viewed as a total space of the principal fibre bundle.
