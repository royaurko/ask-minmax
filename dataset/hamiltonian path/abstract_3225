Explicit path integration is carried out for the Green's functions of special
relativistic harmonic oscillators in (1+1)- and (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski
space-time modeled by a Klein-Gordon particle in the universal covering
space-time of the anti-de Sitter static space-time. The energy spectrum
together with the normalized wave functions are obtained. In the
non-relativistic limit, the bound states of the one- and three-dimensional
ordinary oscillators are regained.
