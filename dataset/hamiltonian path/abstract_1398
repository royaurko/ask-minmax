As a model problem for the study of chaotic Hamiltonian systems, we look for
the effects of a long-tail distribution of recurrence times on a fixed
Hamiltonian dynamics. We follow Stanislavsky's approach of Hamiltonian
formalism for fractional systems. We prove that his formalism can be retrieved
from the fractional embedding theory. We deduce that the fractional Hamiltonian
systems of Stanislavsky stem from a particular least action principle, said
causal. In this case, the fractional embedding becomes coherent.
