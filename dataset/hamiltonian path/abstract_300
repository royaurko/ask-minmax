We investigate transition rates between different spin configurations for $S
\ge 1$ spins weakly coupled to a $d$-dimensional phonon bath. This study is
motivated by understanding observed magnetization relaxation as a function of
temperature in diverse magnetic systems such as arrays of magnetic
nanoparticles and magnetic molecules. We assume that the magnetization of the
spin system relaxes through consecutive emission or absorption of a single
phonon. From a weak, linear spin-phonon coupling Hamiltonian, we derive
transition rates that would be used to examine dynamic properties of the system
in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Although the derived phonon-assisted
transition rates satisfy detailed balance, in the case of two and three
dimensional phonon baths, transitions between degenerate states are not
allowed. Thus, if there are no alternative paths along which the spin system
can relax, the relaxation time diverges. Otherwise, the system finds other
paths, which leads to an increase in the relaxation time and energy barrier.
However, when higher-order phonon processes are included in the transition
rates, it is found that the system can reach the states which were inaccessible
due to the forbidden transitions. As a result, the system recovers some of the
dynamic properties obtained using the Glauber transition rate.
