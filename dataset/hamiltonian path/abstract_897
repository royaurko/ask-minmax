In this work, we study conditions for the existence of length-constrained
path-cycle decompositions, that is, partitions of edge sets of a graph into
paths and cycles of a given minimum length. Our main contribution is the
characterization of the class of all triangle-free graphs with odd distance at
least $3$ that admit a path-cycle decomposition with elements of length at
least $4$. As a consequence, it follows that Gallai's conjecture on path
decomposition holds in a broad class of sparse graphs.
