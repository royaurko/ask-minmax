The N=2 supersymmetric {\alpha}=1 KdV hierarchy in N=2 superspace is
considered and its rich symmetry structure is uncovered. New nonpolynomial and
nonlocal, bosonic and fermionic symmetries and Hamiltonians, bi-Hamiltonian
structure as well as a recursion operator connecting all symmetries and
Hamiltonian structures of the N=2 {\alpha}=1 KdV hierarchy are constructed in
explicit form. It is observed that the algebra of symmetries of the N=2
supersymmetric {\alpha}=1 KdV hierarchy possesses two different subalgebras of
N=2 supersymmetry.
