Traditional approaches to energy-momentum localization led to reference frame
dependent pseudotensors. The more modern idea is quasilocal energy-momentum. We
take a Hamiltonian approach. The Hamiltonian boundary term gives not only the
quasilocal values but also boundary conditions via the Hamiltonian variation
boundary principle. Selecting a Hamiltonian boundary term involves several
choices. We found that superpotentials can serve as Hamiltonian boundary terms,
consequently pseudotensors are actually quasilocal and legitimate. Various
Hamiltonian boundary term quasilocal expressions are considered including some
famous pseudotensors, M{\o}ller's tetrad-teleparallel ``tensor'', Chen's
covariant expressions, the expressions of Katz & coworkers, the expression of
Brown & York, and some spinor expressions. We emphasize the need for
identifying criteria for a good choice.
