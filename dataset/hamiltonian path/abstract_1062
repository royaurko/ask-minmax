In this paper we characterize the minimal left ideals of a Leavitt path
algebra as those ones which are isomorphic to principal left ideals generated
by line point vertices, that is, by vertices whose trees do not contain neither
bifurcations nor closed paths. Moreover, we show that the socle of a Leavitt
path algebra is the two-sided ideal generated by these line point vertices.
This characterization allows us to compute the socle of some algebras that
arise as the Leavitt path algebra of some row-finite graphs. A complete
description of the socle of a Leavitt path algebra is given: it is a locally
matricial algebra.
