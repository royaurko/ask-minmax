We use a continuous-time path integral to obtain the semiclassical propagator
for minimal-spread spin coherent states. We pay particular attention to the
``extra phase'' discovered by Solari and Kochetov, and show that this
correction is related to an anomaly in the fluctuation determinant. We show
that, once this extra factor is included, the semiclassical propagator has the
correct short time behaviour to $O(T^2)$, and demonstrate its consistency under
dissection of the path
