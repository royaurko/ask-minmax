We investigate the effect of the Majorana Fermions which are formed at the
boundary of a p-wave superconductor. When the Majorana overlapping energy is
finite we construct the scattering matrix $\mathbf{S}$ by maping the Majorana
zero mode to Fermions for which coherent states are defined and a path integral
is obtained . The path integral is used to compute the scattering matrix in
terms of the electrons in the leads . This method is suitable for computing the
conductivity. We investigate a chiral Majorana Hamiltonian and show that in the
absence of vortices the conductivity vanish. We compute the conductivity for p
wave superconductor coupled to two metallic leads we show that when the
overlapping energy between the two Majorana fermions is finite the Andreev
Crossed reflection conductance is finite.
