We consider the bi-Hamiltonian representation of the two-component coupled
KdV equations discovered by Drinfel'd and Sokolov and rediscovered by Sakovich
and Foursov. Connection of this equation with the supersymmetric
Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli-Radul-Manin hierarchy is presented. For this new
supersymmetric equation the Lax representation and odd Hamiltonian structure is
given.
