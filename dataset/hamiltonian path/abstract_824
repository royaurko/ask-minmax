The general problem for consistency between arbitrary transports along paths
in fibre bundles and bundle morphisms between them is formulated and
investigated. The special case of one fibre bundle, its morphism and transport
along paths acting in it is considered. The consistency between linear
transports along paths in a vector bundle and a Hermitian structure in it is
studied.
