A simple and accurate relationship is demonstrated that links the average
shortest path, nodes, and edges in a complex network. This relationship takes
advantage of the concept of link density and shows a large improvement in
fitting networks of all scales over the typical random graph model. The
relationships herein can allow researchers to better predict the shortest path
of networks of almost any size.
