We propose a simple construction of the non-Hamiltonian dynamical systems
possessing an invariant measure. These non-Hamiltonian systems are deformations
of the Hamiltonian systems associated with trivial deformations of the
canonical Poisson brackets and time transformation. Sometimes these
non-Hamiltonian systems can be identified with known nonholonomic systems and,
therefore, the results are illustrated through the Chaplygin ball and the
Veselova system.
