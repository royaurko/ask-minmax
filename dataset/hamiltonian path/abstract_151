Employing the Jordan-Wigner transformation on a unique path and then making a
mean-field treatment of the fermionic Hamiltonian, we semiquantitatively
describe the spin-gap states of Heisenberg ladders in a field. The appearance
of magnetization plateaux is clarified as a function of the number of legs.
