A systematic derivation of Boltzmann equation is presented in the framework
of closed-time-path formalism. Introducing a new type of probe, the expectation
value of number operator is calculated as a functional of source. Then solving
for the source by inverting the relation, the equation of motion for number is
obtained when the source is removed, and it turns out to be the Boltzmann
equation. The inversion formula is used in the course of derivation.
