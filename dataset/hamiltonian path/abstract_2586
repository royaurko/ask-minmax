We introduce an extension of hamiltonian dynamics, defined on hyperkahler
manifolds, which we call ``hyperhamiltonian dynamics''. We show that this has
many of the attractive features of standard hamiltonian dynamics. We also
discuss the prototypical integrable hyperhamiltonian systems, i.e. quaternionic
oscillators.
