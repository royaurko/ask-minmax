In this paper we discuss a general strategy to construct vector coherent
states of the Gazeau-Klauder type and we use them to built up examples of
isospectral hamiltonians. For that we use a general strategy recently proposed
by the contributor and which extends well known facts on intertwining operators. We
also discuss the possibility of constructing non-isospectral hamiltonians with
related eigenstates.
