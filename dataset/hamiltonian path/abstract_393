First-principles calculations have been performed for different collinear
magnetic orderings in orthorhombic manganites, such as HoMnO3, TbMnO3 and
YMnO3, showing large GdFeO3-like distortions. Our results suggest that the
AFM-E type ordering, experimentally observed in HoMnO3 and recently proposed
from model hamiltonian studies as a potentially novel phase, is indeed the
magnetic ground state. Its stability is strongly connected with octahedral
distortions and points to the relevance of structural more than chemical
effects. The calculated exchange constants, extracted from a Heisenberg model
used to fit the first-principles total energies, show that the ferromagnetic
in-plane nearest-neighbour coupling is reduced compared to less-distorted
manganites, such as LaMnO3. In parallel, the antiferromagnetic
next-nearest-neighbour coupling along planar Mn-O-O-Mn paths in
highly-distorted manganites plays a relevant role in the stabilization of the
AFM-E spin configuration. In agreement with experiments, the density of states
shows that this phase is insulating with an indirect band-gap of about 0.5 eV.
