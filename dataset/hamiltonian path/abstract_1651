We present a new property, the Disjoint Path Concordances Property, of an ENR
homology manifold X which precisely characterizes when X times R has the
Disjoint Disks Property. As a consequence, X times R is a manifold if and only
if X is resolvable and it possesses this Disjoint Path Concordances Property.
