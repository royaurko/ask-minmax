The propagator associated to the potential barrier $V=V_{0}\cosh ^{-2}(\omega
x)$ is obtained by solving path integrals. The method of delta functionals
based on canonical and other transformations is used to reduce the path
integral for this potential into a path integral for the Morse potential
problem. The dimensional extension technique is seen to be essential for
performing the multiple integral representation of the propagator. The
correctly normalized scattering wave functions and the scattering function are
derived. To test the method employed, the free particle and the $\delta
-$function barrier are considered as limiting cases.
