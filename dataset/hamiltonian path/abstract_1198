A triangulation of a surface is called $q$-equivelar if each of its vertices
is incident with exactly $q$ triangles. In 1972 Altshuler had shown that an
equivelar triangulation of torus has a Hamiltonian Circuit. Here we present a
necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a contractible Hamiltonian
Cycle in equivelar triangulation of a surface.
