The Hamiltonian structure of the two-dimensional dispersionless Toda
hierarchy is studied, this being a particular example of a system of
hydrodynamic type. The polynomial conservation laws for the system turn out,
after a change of variable, to be associated with the axially symmetric
solutions of the 3-dimensional Laplace equation and this enables a generating
function for the Hamiltonian densities to be derived in closed form.
