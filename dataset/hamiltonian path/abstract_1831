The first and second Born approximation are studied with the path integral
representation for $ {\cal T} $ matrix. The $ {\cal T}$ matrix is calculated
for Woods-Saxon potential scattering. To make corresponding integrals solvable
analytically, an approximate function for the Woods-Saxon potential is used.
Finally it shown that the Born series is converge at high energies and orders
higher than two in Born approximation series can be neglected.
