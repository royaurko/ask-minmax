We present the next-to-next-to-leading order post-Newtonian (PN)
spin(1)-spin(2) Hamiltonian for two self-gravitating spinning compact objects.
If both objects are rapidly rotating, then the corresponding interaction is
comparable in strength to a 4PN effect. The Hamiltonian is checked via the
global Poincare algebra with the center-of-mass vector uniquely determined by
an ansatz.
