We study reductions of the Hamiltonian flows restricted to their invariant
submanifolds. As examples, we consider partial Lagrange-Routh reductions of the
natural mechanical systems such as geodesic flows on compact Lie groups and
$n$-dimensional variants of the classical Hess-Appel'rot case of a heavy rigid
body motion about a fixed point.
