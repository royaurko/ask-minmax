The understanding of the asymptotic decay of correlations and of the
distribution of Poincar\'e recurrence times $P(t)$ has been a major challenge
in the field of Hamiltonian chaos for more than two decades. In a recent
Letter, Chirikov and Shepelyansky claimed the universal decay $P(t) \sim
t^{-3}$ for Hamiltonian systems. Their reasoning is based on renormalization
arguments and numerical findings for the sticking of chaotic trajectories near
a critical golden torus in the standard map. We performed extensive numerics
and find clear deviations from the predicted asymptotic exponent of the decay
of $P(t)$. We thereby demonstrate that even in the supposedly simple case, when
a critical golden torus is present, the fundamental question of asymptotic
statistics in Hamiltonian systems remains unsolved.
