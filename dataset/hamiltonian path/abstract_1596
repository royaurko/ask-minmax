We derive Brown-Henneaux's commutation relation and central charge in the
framework of the path integral. If we use the leading part of the asymptotic
symmetry to derive the Ward-Takahashi identity, we can see the central charge
arises from the fact that the boundary condition of the path integral is not
invariant under the transformation.
