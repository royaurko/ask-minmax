The m-photon Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian is a natural generalization of the
much studied Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. In this short note we give the
relevant operators for the time-dependent generalized m-photon Jaynes-Cummings
Hamiltonian. The dynamical equations for these operators are also given. These
operators are needed and indeed are the basic building blocks for performing
calculations in the context of the Maximum Entropy Formalism.
