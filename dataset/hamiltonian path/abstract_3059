We propose a path-integral variant of the DMRG method to calculate real-time
correlation functions at arbitrary finite temperatures. To illustrate the
method we study the longitudinal autocorrelation function of the $XXZ$-chain.
By comparison with exact results at the free fermion point we show that our
method yields accurate results up to a limiting time which is determined by the
spectrum of the reduced density matrix.
