The Hamiltonian description for a wide class of mechanical systems, having
local symmetry transformations depending on time derivatives of the gauge
parameters of arbitrary order, is constructed. The Poisson brackets of the
Hamiltonian and constraints with each other and with arbitrary function are
explicitly obtained. The constraint algebra is proved to be the first class.
