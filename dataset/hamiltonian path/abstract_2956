We show explicitly how the high energy QCD evolution generated by the KLWMIJ
Hamiltonian can be cast in the form of the QCD Reggeon Field Theory. We show
how to reduce the KLWMIJ Hamitonian to physical color singlet degrees of
freedom. We suggest a natural way of defining the Pomeron and other Reggeons in
the framework of the KLWMIJ evolution and derive the QCD Reggeon Field Theory
Hamiltonian which includes several lowest Reggeon operators. This Hamiltonian
generates evolution equations for all Reggeons in the case of dilute-dense
scattering, including the nonlinear Balitsky-Kovchegov equation for the
Pomeron. We also find explicit expressions for the Reggeon conjugate operators
in terms of QCD operators, and derive their evolution equations. This provides
a natural and unambiguous framework for reggeization procedure introduced in
\cite{BW, BE}. The Bartels triple Pomeron vertex is inherited directly from the
RFT Hamiltonian. For simplicity in the bulk of the paper we work in the large
$N_c$ limit.
