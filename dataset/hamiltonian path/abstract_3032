We present a scaling hypothesis for the distribution function of the shortest
paths connecting any two points on a percolating cluster which accounts for
{\it (i)} the effect of the finite size of the system, and {\it (ii)} the
dependence of this distribution on the site occupancy probability $p$. We test
the hypothesis for the case of two-dimensional percolation.
