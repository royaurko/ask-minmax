An analog of the classical Doppler effect is investigated in spaces
(manifolds) whose tangent bundle is endowed with a transport along paths,
which, in particular, can be parallel one. The obtained results are valid
irrespectively to the particles mass, i.e. they hold for massless particles
(e.g. photons) as well as for massive ones.
