A new scheme of first-principles computation for strongly correlated electron
systems is proposed. This scheme starts from the local-density approximation
(LDA) at high-energy band structure, while the low-energy effective Hamiltonian
is constructed by a downfolding procedure using combinations of the constrained
LDA and the GW method. Thus obtained low-energy Hamiltonian is solved by the
path-integral renormalization-group method, where spatial and dynamical
fluctuations are fully considered. An application to Sr$_2$VO$_4$ shows that
the scheme is powerful in agreement with experimental results. It further
predicts a nontrivial orbital-stripe order.
