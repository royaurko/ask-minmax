We demonstrate that the paths followed by a system in fluctuation-activated
switching form a narrow tube in phase space. A theory of the path distribution
is developed and its direct measurement is performed in a micromechanical
oscillator. The experimental and theoretical results are in excellent
agreement, with no adjustable parameters. We also demonstrate the lack of
time-reversal symmetry in switching of systems far from thermal equilibrium.
