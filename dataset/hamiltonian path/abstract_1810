The dispersion-managed (DM) optical system with step-wise periodical
variation of dispersion is studied in the framework of path-averaged
Gabitov-Turitsyn equation. The soliton solution is obtained by iterating the
path-averaged equation. The dependence of soliton parameters on dispersion map
strength is investigated together with the oscillating tails of soliton.
