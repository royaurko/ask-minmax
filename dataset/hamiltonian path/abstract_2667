The phase fluctuation near the saddle point solution of the XY-type
Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian with random temperature is studied. For the
modes with lowest eigenvalue, the systems is self-organized into blocks, which
are coupled as a XY model with random bond. The couplings obtained in this way
agree with those by domain wall method.
