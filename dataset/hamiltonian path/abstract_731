A localized method to distribute paths on random graphs is devised, aimed at
finding the shortest paths between given source/destination pairs while
avoiding path overlaps at nodes. We propose a method based on message-passing
techniques to process global information and distribute paths optimally.
Statistical properties such as scaling with system size and number of paths,
average path-length and the transition to the frustrated regime are analysed.
The performance of the suggested algorithm is evaluated through a comparison
against a greedy algorithm.
