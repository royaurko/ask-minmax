We prove existence of intersection exponents xi(k,lambda) for biased random
walks on d-dimensional half-infinite discrete cylinders, and show that, as
functions of lambda, these exponents are real analytic. As part of the
argument, we prove convergence to stationarity of a time-inhomogeneous Markov
chain on half-infinite random paths. Furthermore, we show this convergence
takes place at exponential rate, an estimate obtained via a coupling of
weighted half-infinite paths.
