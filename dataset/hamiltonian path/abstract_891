Standandard Hamiltonian mechanics in its homogeneous formulation is applied
to the study of discontinuities representing rapid changes of Hamiltonians.
Different formulations of Hamiltonian mechanics are reviewed. An original
representation of a positive homogeneous Hamiltonian system by an outer
oriented coisotropic submanifold of the phase space is proposed.
