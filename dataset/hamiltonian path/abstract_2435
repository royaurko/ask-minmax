In condensed matter physics, the polaron has been fascinating subject. It is
described by the Hamiltonian of H. Fr\"ohlich. In this paper, the Fr\"ohlich
Hamiltonian is investigated from a viewpoint of the self-dual cone analysis
proposed in Miyao (2011). This point of view clarifies the monotonicity of
polaron energy, i.e., denoting the lowest energy of the Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian
with the ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda$ by $E_{\Lambda}$, we prove
$E_{\Lambda}>E_{\Lambda'}$ for $\Lambda<\Lambda'$.
