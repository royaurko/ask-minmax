A class of Hamiltonian deformations of plane curves is defined and studied.
Hamiltonian deformations of conics and cubics are considered as illustrative
examples. These deformations are described by systems of hydrodynamical type
equations. It is shown that solutions of these systems describe processes of
formation of singularities (cusps, nodes), bubbles, and change of genus of a
curve.
