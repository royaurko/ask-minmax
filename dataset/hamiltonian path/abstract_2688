The aim of this paper is to construct formal normal forms for the class of
topologically quasi-homogeneous foliations under generic conditions. Any such
normal form is given as the sum of three terms: an initial generic
quasi-homogeneous term, a hamiltonian term and a radial term. Moreover, we also
show that the number of free coefficients in the hamiltonian part is consistent
with the dimension of Mattei's moduli space of unfoldings.
