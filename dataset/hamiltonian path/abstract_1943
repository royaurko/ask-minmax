Entwined space-time paths are bound pairs of trajectories which are traversed
in opposite directions with respect to macroscopic time. In this paper we show
that ensembles of entwined paths on a discrete space-time lattice are simply
described by coupled difference equations which are discrete versions of the
Dirac equation. There is no analytic continuation, explicit or forced, involved
in this description. The entwined paths are `self-quantizing'. We also show
that simple classical stochastic processes that generate the difference
equations as ensemble averages are stable numerically and converge at a rate
governed by the details of the stochastic process. This result establishes the
Dirac equation in one dimension as a phenomenological equation describing an
underlying classical stochastic process in the same sense that the Diffusion
and Telegraph equations are phenomenological descriptions of stochastic
processes.
