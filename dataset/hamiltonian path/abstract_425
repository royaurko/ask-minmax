Let $(M,\omega)$ be a symplectic manifold, $N\subseteq M$ a coisotropic
submanifold, and $\Sigma$ a compact oriented (real) surface. I define a natural
Maslov index for each continuous map $u:\Sigma\to M$ that sends every connected
component of $\partial\Sigma$ to some isotropic leaf of $N$. This index is real
valued and generalizes the usual Lagrangian Maslov index. The idea is to use
the linear holonomy of the isotropic foliation of $N$ to compensate for the
loss of boundary data in the case codimension $N<\dim M/2$. The definition is
based on the Salamon-Zehnder (mean) Maslov index of a path of linear symplectic
automorphisms. I prove a lower bound on the number of leafwise fixed points of
a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism, if $(M,\omega)$ is geometrically bounded and $N$
is closed, regular (i.e. "fibering"), and monotone. As an application, we
obtain a presymplectic non-embedding result. I also prove a coisotropic version
of the Audin conjecture.
