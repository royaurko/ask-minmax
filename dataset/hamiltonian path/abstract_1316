We propose angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of aerosol particles as
an alternative way to determine the electron mean free path of low energy
electrons in solid and liquid materials. The mean free path is obtained from
fits of simulated photoemission images to experimental ones over a broad range
of different aerosol particle sizes. The principal advantage of the aerosol
approach is twofold. Firstly, aerosol photoemission studies can be performed
for many different materials, including liquids. Secondly, the size-dependent
anisotropy of the photoelectrons can be exploited in addition to size-dependent
changes in their kinetic energy. These finite size effects depend in different
ways on the mean free path and thus provide more information on the mean free
path than corresponding liquid jet, thin film, or bulk data. The present
contribution is a proof of principle employing a simple model for the
photoemission of electrons and preliminary experimental data for potassium
chloride aerosol particles.
