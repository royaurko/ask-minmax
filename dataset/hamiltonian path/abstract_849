A Wiener-regularized path integral is presented as an alternative way to
formulate Berezin-Toeplitz quantization on a toroidal phase space. Essential to
the result is that this quantization prescription for the torus can be
constructed as an induced representation from anti-Wick quantization on its
covering space, the plane. When this construction is expressed in the form of a
Wiener-regularized path integral, symmetrization prescriptions for the
propagator emerge similar to earlier path-integral formulas on
multiply-connected configuration spaces.
