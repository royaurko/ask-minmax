By means of the adiabatic self-consistent collective coordinate method and
the pairing-plus-quadrupole interaction, we have obtained the self-consistent
collective path connecting the oblate and prolate local minima in 68Se and 72Kr
for the first time. The self-consistent collective path is found to run
approximately along the valley connecting the oblate and prolate local minima
in the collective potential energy landscape. This result of calculation
clearly indicates the importance of triaxial deformation dynamics in
oblate-prolate shape coexistence phenomena.
