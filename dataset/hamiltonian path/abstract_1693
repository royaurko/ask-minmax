The aim of this work is the description of the isomorphism classes of all
Leavitt path algebras coming from graphs satisfying Condition (Sing) with up to
three vertices. In particular, this classification recovers the one achieved by
Abrams et al. in the case of graphs whose Leavitt path algebras are purely
infinite simple. The description of the isomorphism classes is given in terms
of a series of invariants including the K_0 group, the socle, the number of
loops with no exits and the number of hereditary and saturated subsets of the
graph.
