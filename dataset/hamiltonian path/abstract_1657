Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph and let $r\ge 1$ be an integer. For a set $D
\subseteq V$, define $N_r[x] = \{y \in V: d(x, y) \leq r\}$ and $D_r(x) =
N_r[x] \cap D$, where $d(x,y)$ denotes the number of edges in any shortest path
between $x$ and $y$. $D$ is known as an $r$-identifying code
($r$-locating-dominating set, respectively), if for all vertices $x\in V$ ($x
\in V\backslash D$, respectively), $D_r(x)$ are all nonempty and different. In
this paper, we provide complete results for $r$-identifying codes in paths and
odd cycles; we also give complete results for 2-locating-dominating sets in
cycles.
