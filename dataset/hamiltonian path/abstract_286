We investigate the electronic structure of the transition-metal oxide YVO3 by
a hybrid first-principles scheme. The density-functional theory with the
local-density-approximation by using the local muffin-tin orbital basis is
applied to derive the whole band structure. The electron degrees of freedom far
from the Fermi level are eliminated by a downfolding procedure leaving only the
V 3d t2g Wannier band as the low-energy degrees of freedom, for which a
low-energy effective model is constructed. This low-energy effective
Hamiltonian is solved exactly by the path-integral renormalization group
method. It is shown that the ground state has the G-type spin and the C-type
orbital ordering in agreement with experimental indications. The indirect
charge gap is estimated to be around 0.7 eV, which prominently improves the
previous estimates by other conventional methods.
