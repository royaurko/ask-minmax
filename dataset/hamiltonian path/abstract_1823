An introduction to Leavitt path algebras of arbitrary directed graphs is
presented, and direct limit techniques are developed, with which many results
that had previously been proved for countable graphs can be extended to
uncountable ones. Such results include characterizations of simplicity,
characterizations of the exchange property, and cancellation conditions for the
K-theoretic monoid of equivalence classes of idempotent matrices.
