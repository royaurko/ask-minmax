We present the exact solution of two-body motion in (1+1) dimensional dilaton
gravity by solving the constraint equations in the canonical formalism. The
determining equation of the Hamiltonian is derived in a transcendental form and
the Hamiltonian is expressed for the system of two identical particles in terms
of the Lambert $W$ function. The $W$ function has two real branches which join
smoothly onto each other and the Hamiltonian on the principal branch reduces to
the Newtonian limit for small coupling constant. On the other branch the
Hamiltonian yields a new set of motions which can not be understood as
relativistically correcting the Newtonian motion. The explicit trajectory in
the phase space $(r, p)$ is illustrated for various values of the energy. The
analysis is extended to the case of unequal masses. The full expression of
metric tensor is given and the consistency between the solution of the metric
and the equations of motion is rigorously proved.
