Grids with blocked and unblocked cells are often used to represent terrain in
robotics and video games. However, paths formed by grid edges can be longer
than true shortest paths in the terrain since their headings are artificially
constrained. We present two new correct and complete any-angle path-planning
algorithms that avoid this shortcoming. Basic Theta* and Angle-Propagation
Theta* are both variants of A* that propagate information along grid edges
without constraining paths to grid edges. Basic Theta* is simple to understand
and implement, fast and finds short paths. However, it is not guaranteed to
find true shortest paths. Angle-Propagation Theta* achieves a better worst-case
complexity per vertex expansion than Basic Theta* by propagating angle ranges
when it expands vertices, but is more complex, not as fast and finds slightly
longer paths. We refer to Basic Theta* and Angle-Propagation Theta*
collectively as Theta*. Theta* has unique properties, which we analyze in
detail. We show experimentally that it finds shorter paths than both A* with
post-smoothed paths and Field D* (the only other version of A* we know of that
propagates information along grid edges without constraining paths to grid
edges) with a runtime comparable to that of A* on grids. Finally, we extend
Theta* to grids that contain unblocked cells with non-uniform traversal costs
and introduce variants of Theta* which provide different tradeoffs between path
length and runtime.
