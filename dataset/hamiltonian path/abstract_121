This paper gives a rigorous interpretation of a Feynman path integral on a
Riemannian manifold M with non-positive sectional curvature. A $L^2$ Riemannian
metric $G_P$ is given on the space of piecewise geodesic paths $H_P(M)$ adapted
to the partition $P$ of $[0,1]$, whence a finite-dimensional approximation of
Wiener measure is developed. It is proved that, as $mesh(P) \to 0$, the
approximate Wiener measure converges in a $L^1$ sense to the measure
$e^{-\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{20\sqrt{3}} \int_0^1 Scal(\sigma(s)) ds} d\nu(\sigma)$
on the Wiener space $W(M)$ with Wiener measure $\nu$. This gives a possible
prescription for the path integral representation of the quantized Hamiltonian,
as well as yielding such a result for the natural geometric approximation
schemes originating in [L. A. Andersson and B. K. Driver, J. Funct. Anal. 165
