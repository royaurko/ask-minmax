We consider rough paths with jumps. In particular, the analogue of Lyons'
extension theorem and rough integration are established in a jump setting,
offering a pathwise view on stochastic integration against cadlag processes. A
class of Levy rough paths is introduced and characterized by a sub-ellipticity
condition on the left-invariant diffusion vector fields and and a certain
integrability property of the Carnot--Caratheodory norm with respect to the
Levy measure on the group, using Hunt's framework of Lie group valued Levy
processes. Examples of Levy rough paths include standard multi-dimensional Levy
process enhanced with stochastic area as constructed by D. Williams, the pure
area Poisson process and Brownian motion in a magnetic field. An explicit
formula for the expected signature is given.
