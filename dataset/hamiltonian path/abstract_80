The proper-time 4d path integral is used as a starting point to derive the
new explicit parametric form of the quark-antiquark Green's function in gluonic
and QED fields, entering as a common Wilson loop. The subsequent vacuum
averaging of the latter allows to derive the instantaneous Hamiltonian. The
explicit form and solutions are given in the case of the $q\bar q$ mesons in
magnetic field.
