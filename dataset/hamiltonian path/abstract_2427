We show that under certain conditions the square of the graph obtained by
identifying a vertex in two graphs with hamiltonian square is also hamiltonian.
Using this result, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for
hamiltonicity of the square of a connected graph such that every vertex of
degree at least three in a block graph corresponds to a cut vertex and any two
these vertices are at distance at least four.
