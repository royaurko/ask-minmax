The Coulomb gas partition sum is rewritten in terms of the path integrals
formalism. It is shown that perturbation theories based on the Mayer expansion
and on the path integrals method lead to the identical results. The well known
Debye-Hukkel result for the case of 3D Coulomb plasma is completely rederived.
An analogous result is obtained for the case of the Coulomb gas with dipoles.
This result can be considered as a generalization of the Debye-Hukkel
approximation. Other possible generalizations including the range of
interaction potentials for which the Debye-Hukkel approximation can be applyed
are discussed.
