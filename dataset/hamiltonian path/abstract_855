Path-integral representations for a scalar particle propagator in non-Abelian
external backgrounds are derived. To this aim, we generalize the procedure
proposed by Gitman and Schvartsman 1993 of path-integral construction to any
representation of SU(N) given in terms of antisymmetric generators. And for
arbitrary representations of SU(N), we present an alternative construction by
means of fermionic coherent states. From the path-integral representations we
derive pseudoclassical actions for a scalar particle placed in non-Abelian
backgrounds. These actions are classically analyzed and then quantized to prove
their consistency.
