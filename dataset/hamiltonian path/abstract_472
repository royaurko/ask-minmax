Using a particle model of slime mould we demonstrate scoping experiments
which explore how path planning may be performed by morphological adaptation.
We initially demonstrate simple path planning by a shrinking blob of virtual
plasmodium between two attractant sources within a polygonal arena. We examine
the case where multiple paths are required and the subsequent selection of a
single path from multiple options. Collision-free paths are implemented via
repulsion from the borders of the arena. Finally, obstacle avoidance is
implemented by repulsion from obstacles as they are uncovered by the shrinking
blob. These examples show proof-of-concept results of path planning by
morphological adaptation which complement existing research on path planning in
novel computing substrates.
