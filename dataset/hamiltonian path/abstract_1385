In this paper we study the reductions of evolutionary PDEs on the manifold of
the stationary points of time-dependent symmetries. In particular we describe
how the finite dimensional Hamiltonian structure of the reduced system is
obtained from the Hamiltonian structure of the initial PDE and we construct the
time-dependent Hamiltonian function. We also present a very general Lagrangian
formulation of the procedure of reduction. As an application we consider the
case of the Painleve' equations PI, PII, PIII, PVI and also certain higher
order systems appeared in the theory of Frobenius manifolds.
