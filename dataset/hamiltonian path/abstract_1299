In source routing, a complete path is chosen for a packet to travel from
source to destination. While computing the time to traverse such a path may be
straightforward in a fixed, static graph, doing so becomes much more
challenging in dynamic graphs, in which the state of an edge in one time slot
(i.e., its presence or absence) is random, and may depend on its state in the
previous time step. The traversal time is due to both time spent waiting for
edges to appear and time spent crossing them once they become available. We
compute the expected traversal time (ETT) for a dynamic path in a number of
special cases of stochastic edge dynamics models, and for three edge failure
models, culminating in a surprisingly challenging yet realistic setting in
which the initial configuration of edge states for the entire path is known. We
show that the ETT for this "initial configuration" setting can be computed in
quadratic time, by an algorithm based on probability generating functions. We
also give several linear-time upper and lower bounds on the ETT.
