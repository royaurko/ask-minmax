An effective Hamiltonian for the localized spins in the one-dimensional Kondo
lattice model is derived via a unitary transformation involving a bosonization
of delocalized conduction electrons. The effective Hamiltonian is shown to
reproduce all the features of the model as identified in various numerical
simulations, and provides much new information on the ferro- to paramagnetic
phase transition and the paramagnetic phase.
