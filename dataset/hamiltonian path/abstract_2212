An effective Hamiltonian for spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level
(LLL) close to half filling is derived. As opposed to the treatment in standard
Chern-Simons theories (CS) we first project to the LLL and only then apply a
CS-transformation on the Hamiltonian. The transformed field operators act in
the lowest Landau level only {\it and} have fermionic commutation relations for
small wavenumbers ignoring gauge field fluctuations. When acting on the
Hamiltonian at half filling the {\it gauge transformation removes the monopole
term in the interaction and does not eliminate the magnetic field.
