A method of building and investigation of the Fermi surfaces for
three-dimensional crystals subjected to a uniform magnetic field is presented.
The Hamiltonian of a charged particle in the crystal is treated in the
framework of the zero-range potential theory. The dispersion relation for the
Hamiltonian is obtained in an explicit form.
