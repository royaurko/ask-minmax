We address the following question: Which kinds of symmetry protected
topological (SPT) Hamiltonians can be many-body localized? That is, which
Hamiltonians with an SPT ground state have finite energy density excited states
which are all localized by disorder? Based on the observation that a finite
energy density state, if localized, can be viewed as the ground state of a
local Hamiltonian, we propose a simple (though possibly incomplete) rule for
many-body localization of SPT Hamiltonians: If the ground state and top state
(highest energy state) belong to the same SPT phase, then it is possible to
localize all the finite energy density states; If the ground and top state
belong to different SPT phases, then most likely there are some finite energy
density states which can not be fully localized. We will give concrete examples
of both scenarios. In some of these examples, we argue that interaction can
actually "assist" localization of finite energy density states, which is
counter-intuitive to what is usually expected.
