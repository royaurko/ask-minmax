This work provides explicit characterizations and formulae for the minimal
polynomials of a wide variety of structured $4\times 4$ matrices. These include
symmetric, Hamiltonian and orthogonal matrices. Applications such as the
complete determination of the Jordan structure of skew-Hamiltonian matrices and
the computation of the Cayley transform are given. Some new classes of matrices
are uncovered, whose behaviour insofar as minimal polynomials are concerned, is
remarkably similar to those of skew-Hamiltonian and Hamiltonian matrices. The
main technique is the invocation of the associative algebra isomorphism between
the tensor product of the quaternions with themselves and the algebra of real
$4\times 4$ matrices.
