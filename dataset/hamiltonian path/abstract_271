Multistep denaturation in a short circular DNA molecule is analyzed by a
mesoscopic Hamiltonian model which accounts for the helicoidal geometry.
Computation of melting profiles by the path integral method suggests that
stacking anharmonicity stabilizes the double helix against thermal disruption
of the hydrogen bonds. Twisting is essential in the model to capture the
importance of nonlinear effects on the thermodynamical properties. In a ladder
model with zero twist, anharmonic stacking scarcely affects the thermodynamics.
Moderately untwisted helices, with respect to the equilibrium conformation,
show an energetic advantage against the overtwisted ones. Accordingly
moderately untwisted helices better sustain local fluctuational openings and
make more unlikely the thermally driven complete strand separation.
