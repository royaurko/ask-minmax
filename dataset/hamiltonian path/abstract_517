In applying the stationary phase approximation to coherent state path
integrals a difficulty occurs; there are no classical paths that satisfy the
boundary conditions of the path integral. Others have gotten around this
problem by reevaluating the action. In this work it is shown that it is not
necessary to reevaluate the action because the stationary phase approximation
is applicable so long as the path, about which the expansion is performed,
satisfies the associated Lagrange's equations of motion. It is not necessary
for this path to satisfy the boundary conditions in order to apply the
stationary phase approximation.
