We consider the geometric formulation of the Hamiltonian formalism for field
theory in terms of {\em Hamiltonian connections} and {\em multisymplectic
forms}. In this framework the covariant Hamilton equations for Mechanics and
field theory are defined in terms of multisymplectic $(n+2)$--forms, where $n$
is the dimension of the basis manifold, together with connections on the
configuration bundle. We provide a new geometric Hamiltonian description of
field theory, based on the introduction of a suitable {\em composite fibered
bundle} which plays the role of an {\em extended configuration bundle}. Instead
of fibrations over an $n$--dimensional base manifold $\bX$, we consider {\em
fibrations over a line bundle $\Tht$ fibered over $\bX$}. The concepts of {\em
extended Legendre bundle}, {\em Hamiltonian connection}, {\em Hamiltonian form}
and {\em covariant Hamilton equations} are introduced and put in relation with
the corresponding standard concepts in the polymomentum approach to field
theory.
