We have studied the dynamics and symmetries of a particle constrained to move
in a torus knot. The Hamiltonian system turns out to be Second Class in Dirac's
formulation and the Dirac brackets yield novel noncommutative structures. The
equations of motion are obtained for a path in general where the knot is
present in the particle orbit but it is not restricted to a particular torus.
We also study the motion when it is restricted to a specific torus. The
rotational symmetries are studied as well. We have also considered the behavior
of small fluctuations of the particle motion about a fixed torus knot.
