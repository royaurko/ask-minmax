In this paper,we investigate diameter and average path length(APL) of
Sierpinski pentagon based on its recursive construction and self-similar
structure.We find that the diameter of Sierpinski pentagon is just the shortest
path lengths between two nodes of generation 0. Deriving and solving the linear
homogenous recurrence relation the diameter satisfies, we obtain rigorous
solution for the diameter. We also obtain approximate solution for APL of
Sierpinski pentagon, both diameter and APL grow approximately as a power-law
function of network order $N(t)$, with the exponent equals
$\frac{\ln(1+\sqrt{3})}{\ln(5)}$. Although the solution for APL is
approximate,it is trusted because we have calculated all items of APL
accurately except for the compensation($\Delta_{t}$) of total distances between
non-adjacent branches($\Lambda_t^{1,3}$), which is obtained approximately by
least-squares curve fitting. The compensation($\Delta_{t}$) is only a small
part of total distances between non-adjacent branches($\Lambda_t^{1,3}$) and
has little effect on APL. Further more,using the data obtained by iteration to
test the fitting results, we find the relative error for $\Delta_{t}$ is less
than $10^{-7}$, hence the approximate solution for average path length is
almost accurate.
