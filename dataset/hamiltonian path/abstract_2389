For a non-relativistic particle subject to a Hamiltonian that is quadratic in
position and momentum, with coefficients that may vary with time, it is shown
that the effect of the linear terms in the Hamiltonian is just a spatial
translation of the wave function and a change in its phase. The shifts in
position and phase can be expressed in terms of classical trajectories. This
simple effect of the linear terms is related to the fact that all moments about
the centroid of the wave function evolve independently of the linear terms.
