Dupire's functional It\^o calculus provides an alternative approach to the
classical Malliavin calculus for the computation of sensitivities, also called
Greeks, of path-dependent derivatives prices. In this paper, we introduce a
measure of path-dependence of functionals within the functional It\^o calculus
framework. Namely, we consider the Lie bracket of the space and time functional
derivatives, which we use to classify functionals according to their degree of
path-dependence. We then revisit the problem of efficient numerical computation
of Greeks for path-dependent derivatives using integration by parts techniques.
Special attention is paid to path-dependent functionals with zero Lie bracket,
called weakly path-dependent functionals in our classification. We then derive
the weighted-expectation formulas for their Greeks, that was first derived
using Malliavin calculus. In the more general case of fully path-dependent
functionals, we show that, equipped with the functional It\^o calculus, we are
able to analyze the effect of the Lie bracket on computation of Greeks. This
was not achieved using Malliavin calculus. Numerical examples are also
provided.
