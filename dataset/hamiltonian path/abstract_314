This note is devoted to representation of some evolution semigroups. The
semigroups are generated by pseudo-differential operators, which are obtained
by different (parametrized by a number $\tau$) procedures of quantization from
a certain class of functions (or symbols) defined on the phase space. This
class contains functions which are second order polynomials with respect to the
momentum variable and also some other functions. The considered semigroups are
represented as limits of $n$-fold iterated integrals when $n$ tends to infinity
(such representations are called Feynman formulae). Some of these
representations are constructed with the help of another pseudo-differential
operators, obtained by the same procedure of quantization (such representations
are called Hamiltonian Feynman formulae). Some representations are based on
integral operators with elementary kernels (these ones are called Lagrangian
Feynman formulae and are suitable for computations). A family of phase space
Feynman pseudomeasures corresponding to different procedures of quantization is
introduced. The considered evolution semigroups are represented also as phase
space Feynman path integrals with respect to these Feynman pseudomeasures. The
obtained Lagrangian Feynman formulae allow to calculate these phase space
Feynman path integrals and to connect them with some functional integrals with
respect to probability measures.
