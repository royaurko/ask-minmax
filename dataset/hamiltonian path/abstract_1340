Following systematically the generalized Hamiltonian approach of Batalin,
Fradkin and Tyutin, we embed the second-class non-abelian self-dual model of P.
K. Townsend et al into a gauge theory. The strongly involutive Hamiltonian and
constraints are obtained as an infinite power series in the auxiliary fields.
By formally summing the series we obtain a simple interpretation for the
first-class Hamiltonian, constraints and observables.
