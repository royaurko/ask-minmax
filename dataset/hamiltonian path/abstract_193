Different classes of physical systems with sizeable electron-phonon coupling
and lattice distortions present anomalous resistivity behaviors versus
temperature. We study a molecular lattice Hamiltonian in which polaronic charge
carriers interact with non linear potentials provided by local atomic
fluctuations between two equilibrium sites. We study a molecular lattice
Hamiltonian in which polaronic charge carriers interact with non linear
potentials provided by local atomic fluctuations between two equilibrium sites.
A path integral model is developed to select the class of atomic oscillations
which mainly contributes to the partition function and the electrical
resistivity is computed in a number of representative cases. We argue that the
common origin of the observed resistivity anomalies lies in the time retarded
nature of the polaronic interactions in the local structural instabilities.
