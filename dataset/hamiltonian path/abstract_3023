We derive an expression for the transport mean free path $\ell^*_\perp$
associated with magneto-transverse light diffusion for a random collection of
Faraday-active
  Mie scatterers. This expression relates the magneto-transverse diffusion in
multiple scattering directly to the magneto-transverse scattering of a single
scatterer.
