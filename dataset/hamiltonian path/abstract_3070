A theoretical non-pertubative treatment is developed to explain the dephasing
of electrons in the electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer via interaction with
a near-by partitioned electronic channel, which acts as a "which path"
detector. The resulting formula reproduces the recant experimental behavior of
the MZI interference visibility. By fitting the model to the experimental
results, it is shown that the visibility is strongly influenced by merely ~3
detecting electrons, hence it reflects the Non-Gaussian properties behavior of
the detector shot-noise.
