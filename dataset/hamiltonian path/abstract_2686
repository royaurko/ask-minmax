In this paper we investigate a family of Hamiltonian-minimal Lagrangian
submanifolds in ${\mathbb C}^m$, ${\mathbb C}P^m$ and other symplectic toric
manifolds constructed from intersections of real quadrics. In particular we
explain the nature of this phenomenon by proving H-minimality in a more
conceptual way, and prove minimality of the same submanifolds in the
corresponding moment-angle manifolds.
