The Lorentz-covariant quantization performed in the Hamiltonian path-integral
formalism for massless non-Abelian gauge fields has been achieved. In this
quantization, the Lorentz condition, as a constraint, must be introduced
initially and incorporated into the Yang-Mills Lagrangian by the Lagrange
undetermined multiplier method. In this way, it is found that all Lorentz
components of a vector potential have thier corresponding conjugate canonical
variables. This fact allows us to define Lorentz-invariant poisson brackets and
carry out the quantization in a Lorent-covariant manner. Key words: Non-Abelian
gauge field, quantization, Hamiltonian path-integral formalism, Lorentz
covariance.
