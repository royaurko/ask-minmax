Let f(k) denote the maximum such that every simple undirected graph
containing two vertices s,t and k edge-disjoint s-t paths, also contains two
vertices u,v and f(k) independent u-v paths. Here, a set of paths is
independent if none of them contains an interior vertex of another. We prove
that f(k)=k if k<3, and f(k)=3 otherwise.
