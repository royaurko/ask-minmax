A Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional (1-D) dissipative system is given which
shows that the trajectories in the spaces ($x,\dot x$) and ($x,p$) are
completely different. The trajectory in the space ($x,p$) has an unexpected
contra-intuitive behavior, and a canonical transformation does not solve this
behavior.
