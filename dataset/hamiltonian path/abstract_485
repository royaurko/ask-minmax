We pursue the analysis made in [1] on the arithmetic area enclosed by m
closed Brownian paths. We pay a particular attention to the random variable
S{n1,n2, ...,n} (m) which is the arithmetic area of the set of points, also
called winding sectors, enclosed n1 times by path 1, n2 times by path 2, ...,nm
times by path m. Various results are obtained in the asymptotic limit
m->infinity. A key observation is that, since the paths are independent, one
can use in the m paths case the SLE information, valid in the 1-path case, on
the 0-winding sectors arithmetic area.
