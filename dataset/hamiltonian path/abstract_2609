A discussion of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics is presented at a level
which should be suitable for advanced high school students. This is intended
for those who wish to explore a version of mechanics beyond the usual Newtonian
treatment in high schools, but yet who do not have advanced mathematical
skills.
