In a first order approximation, the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian with on site
interaction is obtained from the free Hamiltonian (U=0) and generalized
commutation relation for the annihilation-creation operators. Similar
generalized commutation relations were used for the first time in high energy
physics. The spectrum of the system can be found formally by using the
algebraic properties of the generalized operators.
