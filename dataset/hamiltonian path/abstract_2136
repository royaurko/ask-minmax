Based on the symmetry properties of graphene lattice, we derive the effective
Hamiltonian of graphene under spatially non-uniform acoustic and optical
strains. We show that with the proper selection of the parameters, the obtained
Hamiltonian reproduces the results of first-principles spectrum calculations
for acoustic strain up to 10%. The results are generalized for the case of
graphene with broken plane reflection symmetry, which corresponds, for example,
to the case of graphene placed at a substrate. Here, essential modifications to
the Hamiltonian give rise, in particular, to the gap opening in the spectrum in
the presence of the out of plane component of optical strain, which is shown to
be due to the lifting of the sublattice symmetry. The developed effective
Hamiltonian can be used as a convenient tool for analysis of a variety of
strain-related effects, including electron-phonon interaction or
pseudo-magnetic fields induced by the non-uniform strain.
