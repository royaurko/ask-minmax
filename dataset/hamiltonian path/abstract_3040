The use of variational method in functional integral approach is discussed
for fermion and boson systems with Coulomb interaction. The formal general
expression of thermodynamic potential is obtained by Feynman path integral
technique and representation of Coulomb interaction with functional integrals.
Introduced additional complex field show to transform the problem to
calculation of functional integrals containing third order vertices. The
thermodynamic potential can be found from variational principle with respect to
field cumulants. The calculation of the equation of state and critical
properties is demonstrated for symmetrical plasma by variation of finite number
of parameters in the propagator.
