We study from a Hamiltonian point of view the generalized dispersionless KdV
hierarchy of equations. From the so called dispersionless Lax representation of
these equations we obtain three compatible Hamiltonian structures. The second
and third Hamiltonian structures are calculated directly from the r-matrix
approach. Since the third structure is not related recursively with the first
two ones the generalized dispersionless KdV hierarchy can be characterized as a
truly tri-Hamiltonian system.
