Submanifolds of a manifold are described as sections of a certain fiber
bundle that enables one to consider their Lagrangian and (polysymplectic)
Hamiltonian dynamics as that of a particular classical field theory. In
particular, their Lagrangians and Hamiltonians must satisfy rather restrictive
Noether identities. For instance, this is the case of relativistic mechanics
and classical string theory.
