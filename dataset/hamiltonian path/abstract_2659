Line-narrowing by periodic modulation of nuclear spin interaction
Hamiltonians is the central element of various experimental techniques in NMR
spectroscopy. In this study, we present a theoretical formulation of coherent
averaging to calculate the heights of narrowed spectral peaks. This concept is
experimentally demonstrated using proton spectra of solids obtained under fast
magic-angle spinning.
