We use prime coalgebras as a generalization of simple coalgebras, and observe
that prime subcoalgebras represent the structure of the coalgebra in a more
efficient way than simple coalgebras. In particular, in this work we focus our
attention on the study and characterization of prime subcoalgebras of path
coalgebras of quivers and, by extension, of prime pointed coalgebras.
