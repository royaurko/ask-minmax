In this paper we outline methodology to efficiently simulate (jump) diffusion
bridge sample paths without discretisation error. We achieve this by
considering the simulation of conditioned (jump) diffusion bridge sample paths
in light of recent work developing a mathematical framework for simulating
finite dimensional sample path skeletons (which flexibly characterise the
entirety of sample paths).
