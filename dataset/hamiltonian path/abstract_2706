This short note is devoted to the Hamiltonian analysis of the normalized
general relativity and recently proposed model of vacuum energy sequestering.
The common property of these models is the presence of the global variables. We
discuss the meaning of these global variables in the context of the canonical
formalism and argue that their presence lead to the non-local form of the
Hamiltonian constraint.
