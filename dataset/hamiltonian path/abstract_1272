We derive a closed-form solution for the price of an average price as well as
an average strike geometric Asian option, by making use of the path integral
formulation. Our results are compared to a numerical Monte Carlo simulation. We
also develop a pricing formula for an Asian option with a barrier on a control
process, combining the method of images with a partitioning of the set of paths
according to the average along the path. This formula is exact when the
correlation is zero, and is approximate when the correlation increases.
