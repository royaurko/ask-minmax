We discuss measures on spaces of unparametrized paths related to the Wiener
measure. These measures arise naturally in the study of one-dimensional gravity
coupled to scalar fields. Two kinds of discrete approximations are defined, the
piecewise linear and the hypercubic approximations. The convergence of these
approximations in the sense of weak convergence of measures is proven. We
describe a family of sets of unparametrized paths that are analogous to
cylinder sets of parametrized paths. Integrals over some of these sets are
evaluated in terms of Dirichlet propagators in bounded regions.
