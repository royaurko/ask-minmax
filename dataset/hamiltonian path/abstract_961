We study the uniqueness in the path-by-path sense (i.e. $\omega$-by-$\omega$)
of solutions to stochastic differential equations with additive noise and
non-Lipschitz autonomous drift. The notion of path-by-path solution involves
considering a collection of ordinary differential equations and is, in
principle, weaker than that of a strong solution, since no adaptability
condition is required. We use results and ideas from the classical theory of
ode's, together with probabilistic tools like Girsanov's theorem, to establish
the uniqueness property for some classes of noises, including Brownian motion,
and some drift functions not necessarily bounded nor continuous.
