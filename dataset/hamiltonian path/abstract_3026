Physical properties of anisotropic superconductors like the critical
temperature and others depend sensitively on the electron mean free path. The
sensitivity to impurity scattering and the resulting anomalies are considered a
characteristic feature of strongly anisotropic pairing. These anomalies are
usually analyzed in terms of s-wave impurity scattering which leads to
universal pair breaking effects depending on only two scattering parameters,
the mean free path and the impurity cross section. We investigate here
corrections coming from anisotropies in the scattering cross section, and find
not only quantitative but also qualitative deviations from universal s-wave
isotropic pairbreaking. The properties we study are the transition temperature,
the density of states, quasiparticle bound states at impurities, and pinning of
flux lines by impurities.
