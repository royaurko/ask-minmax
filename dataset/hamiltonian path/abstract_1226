Fullerene graphs, i.e., 3-connected planar cubic graphs with pentagonal and
hexagonal faces, are conjectured to be hamiltonian. This is a special case of a
conjecture of Barnette, dating back to the 60s, stating that 3-connected planar
graphs with faces of size at most 6 are hamiltonian. We prove the conjecture.
