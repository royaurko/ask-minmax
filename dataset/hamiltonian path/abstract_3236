It has been shown that the last passage time in certain symmetrized models of
directed percolation can be written in terms of averages over random matrices
from the classical groups $U(l)$, $Sp(2l)$ and $O(l)$. We present a theory of
such results based on non-intersecting lattice paths, and integration
techniques familiar from the theory of random matrices. Detailed derivations of
probabilities relating to two further symmetrizations are also given.
