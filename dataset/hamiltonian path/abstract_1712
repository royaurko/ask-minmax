Recent studies have demonstrated an interesting connection between the
asymptotic behavior at ruin of a Levy insurance risk process under the
Cramer-Lundberg and convolution equivalent conditions. For example the limiting
distributions of the overshoot and the undershoot are strikingly similar in
these two settings. This is somewhat surprising since the global sample path
behavior of the process under these two conditions is quite different. Using
tools from excursion theory and fluctuation theory we provide a unified
approach, which explains this connection and leads to new asymptotic results,
by describing the evolution of the sample paths from the time of last maximum
prior to ruin until ruin occurs.
