Quantum systems usually travel a multitude of different paths when evolving
through time from an initial to a final state. In general, the possible paths
will depend on the future and past boundary conditions, as well as the system's
dynamics. We present a gedankenexperiment where mutually exclusive paths are
followed deterministically and simultaneously, by the same system, depending on
which measurement was performed. We show how this `paradoxical' behavior is
interpreted in the weak measurement formalism where the back action of the
measurement cannot be used to account for the strange behavior. To support our
predictions we present a method for performing both the strong and weak
measurement.
