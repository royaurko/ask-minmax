In this paper we discuss the relation between the unimodularity of a Lie
algebroid $\tau_{A}: A\to Q$ and the existence of invariant volume forms for
the hamiltonian dynamics on the dual bundle $A^{*}$. The results obtained in
this direction are applied to several hamiltonian systems on different examples
of Lie algebroids.
