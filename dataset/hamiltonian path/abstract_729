We prove that on the set of lattice paths with steps N=(0,1) and E=(1,0) that
lie between two boundaries T and B, the statistics 'number of E steps shared
with B' and 'number of E steps shared with T' have a symmetric joint
distribution. We give an involution that switches these statistics, preserves
additional parameters, and generalizes to paths that contain steps S=(0,-1) at
prescribed x-coordinates. We also show that a similar equidistribution result
for path statistics follows from the fact that the Tutte polynomial of a
matroid is independent of the order of its ground set. We extend the two
theorems to k-tuples of paths between two boundaries, and we give some
applications to Dyck paths, generalizing a result of Deutsch, to watermelon
configurations, and to pattern-avoiding permutations.
  Finally, we prove a conjecture of Nicol\'as about the distribution of degrees
of k consecutive vertices in a k-triangulation of a convex n-gon, by providing
a new bijection between certain k-tuples of paths and k-flagged semistandard
Young tableaux.
