In our previous work, a unified description as polynomial Hamiltonian systems
was established for a broad class of the Schlesinger systems including the
sixth Painleve equation and Garnier systems. The main purpose of this paper is
to present particular solutions of this Hamiltonian system in terms of a
certain generalization of Gauss' hypergeometric function. Key ingredients of
the argument are the linear Pfaffian system derived from an integral
representation of the hypergeometric function (with the aid of twisted de Rham
theory) and Lax formalism of the Hamiltonian system.
