One main issue, when numerically integrating autonomous Hamiltonian systems,
is the long-term conservation of some of its invariants, among which the
Hamiltonian function itself. Recently, a new class of methods, named
Hamiltonian Boundary Value Methods (HBVMs) has been introduced and analysed,
which are able to exactly preserve polynomial Hamiltonians of arbitrarily high
degree. We here study a further property of such methods, namely that of
having, when cast as a Runge-Kutta method, a matrix of the Butcher tableau with
the same spectrum (apart from the zero eigenvalues) as that of the
corresponding Gauss-Legendre method, independently of the considered abscissae.
Consequently, HBVMs are always perfectly A-stable methods. This, in turn,
allows to elucidate the existing connections with classical Runge-Kutta
collocation methods.
