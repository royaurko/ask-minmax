We construct an infinite family of connected, 2-generated Cayley digraphs
Cay(G;a,b) that do not have hamiltonian paths, such that the orders of the
generators a and b are arbitrarily large. We also prove that if G is any finite
group with |[G,G]| < 4, then every connected Cayley digraph on G has a
hamiltonian path (but the conclusion does not always hold when |[G,G]| = 4 or
5).
