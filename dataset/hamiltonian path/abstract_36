We propose a novel path sampling method based on the Onsager-Machlup (OM)
action by generalizing the multiscale enhanced sampling (MSES) technique
suggested by Moritsugu and coworkers (J. Chem. Phys. 133, 224105 (2010)). The
basic idea of this method is that the system we want to study (for example,
some molecular system described by molecular mechanics) is coupled to a
coarse-grained (CG) system, which can move more quickly and computed more
efficiently than the original system. We simulate this combined system
(original + CG system) using (underdamped) Langevin dynamics where different
heat baths are coupled to the two systems. When the coupling is strong enough,
the original system is guided by the CG system, and able to sample the
configuration and path space more efficiency. We need to correct the bias
caused by the coupling, however, by employing the Hamiltonian replica exchange
where we prepare many path replica with different coupling strengths. As a
result, an unbiased path ensemble for the original system can be found in the
weakest coupling path ensemble. This strategy is easily implemented because a
weight for a path calculated by the OM action is formally the same as the
Boltzmann weight if we properly define the path "Hamiltonian". We apply this
method to a model polymer with Asakura-Oosawa interaction, and compare the
results with the conventional transition path sampling method.
