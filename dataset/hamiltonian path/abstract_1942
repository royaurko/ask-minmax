In perturbative calculations of quantum-statistical zero-temperature path
integrals in curvilinear coordinates one encounters Feynman diagrams involving
multiple temporal integrals over products of distributions, which are
mathematically undefined. In addition, there are terms proportional to powers
of Dirac delta-functions at the origin coming from the measure of path
integration. We give simple rules for integrating products of distributions in
such a way that the results ensure coordinate independence of the path
integrals. The rules are derived by using equations of motion and partial
integration, while keeping track of certain minimal features originating in the
unique definition of all singular integrals in $1 - \epsilon$ dimensions. Our
rules yield the same results as the much more cumbersome calculations in 1-
epsilon dimensions where the limit epsilon --> 0 is taken at the end. They also
agree with the rules found in an independent treatment on a finite time
interval.
