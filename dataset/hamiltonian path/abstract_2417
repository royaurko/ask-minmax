The existence of the Hamiltonians of the renormalized point interactions in
two and three dimensional Riemannian manifolds and that of a relativistic
extension of this model in two dimensions are proven. Although it is much more
difficult, the proof of existence of the Hamiltonian for the renormalized
resolvent for the non-relativistic Lee model can still be given. To accomplish
these results directly from the resolvent formula, we employ some basic tools
from the semigroup theory.
