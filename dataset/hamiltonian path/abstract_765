All the geometric phases, adiabatic and non-adiabatic, are formulated in a
unified manner in the second quantized path integral formulation. The exact
hidden local symmetry inherent in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation defines the
holonomy. All the geometric phases are shown to be topologically trivial. The
geometric phases are briefly compared to the chiral anomaly which is naturally
formulated in the path integral.
