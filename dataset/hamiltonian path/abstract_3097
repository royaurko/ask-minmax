The mean free path of neutrino - free electron gas interaction has been
calculated by taking into account the neutrino electromagnetic form factors and
the possibility of neutrino oscillation. It is shown that the form factor
effect becomes significant for a neutrino magnetic moment \mu_\nu > 10^{-10}
mu_B and for a neutrino radius R > 10^{-6} MeV^{-1}. The mean free path is
found to be sensitive to the nu_e-nu_mu and nu_e-nu_e^R transition
probabilities.
