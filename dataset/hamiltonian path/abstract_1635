We construct a bijection between 231-avoiding permutations and Dyck paths
that sends the sum of the major index and the inverse major index of a
231-avoiding permutation to the major index of the corresponding Dyck path.
Furthermore, we relate this bijection to others and exhibit a bistatistic on
231-avoiding permutations which is related to the q,t-Catalan numbers.
