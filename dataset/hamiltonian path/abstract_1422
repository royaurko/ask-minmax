In this note we show that for any Hamiltonian defined on a symplectic
4-manifold M and any point p in M, there exists a C2-close Hamiltonian whose
regular energy surface through p is either Anosov or it contains a homoclinic
tangency. Our result is based on a general construction of Hamiltonian
suspensions for given symplectomorphisms on Poincar\'e sections already known
to yield similar properties.
