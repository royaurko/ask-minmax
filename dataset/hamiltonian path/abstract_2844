The two-photon Rabi Hamiltonian is a simple model describing the interaction
of light with matter, with the interaction being mediated by the exchange of
two photons. Although this model is exactly soluble in the rotating-wave
approximation, we work with the full Hamiltonian, maintaining the
non-integrability of the model. We demonstrate that, despite this
non-integrability, there exist isolated, exact solutions for this model
analogous to the so-called Juddian solutions found for the single-photon Rabi
Hamiltonian. In so doing we use a Bogoliubov transformation of the field mode,
as described by the present contributors in an earlier publication.
