We study some percolation problems on the complete graph over $\mathbf N$. In
particular, we give sharp sufficient conditions for the existence of (finite or
infinite) cliques and paths in a random subgraph. No specific assumption on the
probability, such as independency, is made. The main tools are a topological
version of Ramsey theory, exchangeability theory and elementary ergodic theory.
