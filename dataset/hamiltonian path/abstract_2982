Let $D$ be a strongly connected directed graph of order $n\geq 4$. In
\cite{[14]} (J. of Graph Theory, Vol.16, No. 5, 51-59, 1992) Y. Manoussakis
proved the following theorem: Suppose that $D$ satisfies the following
condition for every triple $x,y,z$ of vertices such that $x$ and $y$ are
non-adjacent: If there is no arc from $x$ to $z$, then
$d(x)+d(y)+d^+(x)+d^-(z)\geq 3n-2$. If there is no arc from $z$ to $x$, then
$d(x)+d(y)+d^-(x)+d^+(z)\geq 3n-2$. Then $D$ is Hamiltonian. In this paper we
show that: If $D$ satisfies the condition of Manoussakis' theorem, then $D$
contains a pre-Hamiltonian cycle (i.e., a cycle of length $n-1$) or $n$ is even
and $D$ is isomorphic to the complete bipartite digraph with partite sets of
cardinalities $n/2$ and $n/2$.
