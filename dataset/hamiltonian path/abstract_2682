We construct a "Chern-Simons-like" action for N=1 Topologically Massive
Supergravity from the Chern-Simons actions of N=1 Supergravity and Conformal
Supergravity. We convert this action into Hamiltonian form and use this to
demonstrate that the theory propagates a single massive (2, 3/2)
supermultiplet.
