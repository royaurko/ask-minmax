We study a large class of models with an arbitrary (finite) number of degrees
of freedom, described by Hamiltonians which are polynomial in bosonic creation
and annihilation operators, and including as particular cases n-th harmonic
generation and photon cascades. For each model, we construct a complete set of
commuting integrals of motion of the Hamiltonian, fully characterize the common
eigenspaces of the integrals of motion, and show that the action of the
Hamiltonian in these common eigenspaces can be represented by a quasi-exactly
solvable reduced Hamiltonian, whose expression in terms of the usual generators
of sl(2) is computed explicitly.
