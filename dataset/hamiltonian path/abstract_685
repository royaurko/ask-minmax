Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians H possess the real (i.e., observable) spectra
inside certain specific domains of parameters D. In general, the determination
of their observability-horizon boundaries is difficult. We list the
pseudo-Hermitian real N by N matrix Hamiltonians for which the prototype
horizons are defined by closed analytic formulae.
