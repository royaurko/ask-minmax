We use the light-front Hamiltonian of transverse lattice gauge theory to
compute from first principles the glueball spectrum and light-front
wavefunctions in the leading order of the 1/N_c colour expansion. We find
0^{++}, 2^{++}, and 1^{+-} glueballs having masses consistent with N_c=3 data
available from Euclidean lattice path integral methods. The wavefunctions
exhibit a light-front constituent gluon structure.
