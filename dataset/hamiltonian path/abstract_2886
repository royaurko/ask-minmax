An effective characterization of chaotic conservative Hamiltonian systems in
terms of the curvature associated with a Riemannian metric tensor derived from
the structure of the Hamiltonian has been extended to a wide class of potential
models of standard form through definition of a conformal metric. The geodesic
equations reproduce the Hamilton equations of the original potential model
through an inverse map in the tangent space. The second covariant derivative of
the geodesic deviation in this space generates a dynamical curvature, resulting
in (energy dependent) criteria for unstable behavior different from the usual
Lyapunov criteria. We show here that this criterion can be constructively used
to modify locally the potential of a chaotic Hamiltonian model in such a way
that stable motion is achieved. Since our criterion for instability is local in
coordinate space, these results provide a new and minimal method for achieving
control of a chaotic system.
