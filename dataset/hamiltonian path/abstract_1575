The spectral flow of the overlap operator is computed numerically along a
particular path in gauge field space. The path connects two gauge equivalent
configurations which differ by a gauge transformation in the non-trivial class
of pi_4(SU(2)). The computation is done with the SU(2) gauge field in the
fundamental, the 3/2, and the 5/2 representation. The number of eigenvalue
pairs that change places along this path is established for these three
representations and an even-odd pattern predicted by Witten is verified.
