For $r \in \mathbb{N}\setminus \{0\}$ an \emph{$r$-edge coloring} of a graph
or hypergraph $G=(V,E)$ is a map $c:E\to \{0, \dots, r-1\}$. Extending results
of Rado and answering questions of Rado, Gy\'arf\'as and S\'ark\"ozy we prove
that
  1. every $r$-edge colored complete $k$-uniform hypergraph on $\mathbb{N}$ can
be partitioned into $r$ monochromatic tight paths with distinct colors (a tight
path in a $k$-uniform hypergraph is a sequence of distinct vertices such that
every set of $k$ consecutive vertices forms an edge),
  2. for all natural numbers $r$ and $k$ there is a natural number $M$ such
that the every $r$-edge colored complete graph on $\mathbb{N}$ can be
partitioned into $M$ monochromatic $k^{th}$ powers of paths apart from a finite
set (a $k^{th}$ power of a path is a sequence $v_0, v_1, \dots$ of distinct
vertices such that $|i-j| \le k$ implies that $\{v_i, v_j\}$ is an edge),
  3. every $2$-edge colored complete graph on $\mathbb{N}$ can be partitioned
into $4$ monochromatic squares of paths, but not necessarily into $3$,
  4. every $2$-edge colored complete graph on $\omega_1$ can be partitioned
into $2$ monochromatic paths with distinct colors.
