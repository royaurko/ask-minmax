We consider the tracking of geometric paths in output spaces of nonlinear
systems subject to input and state constraints without pre-specified timing
requirements. Such problems are commonly referred to as constrained output
path-following problems. Specifically, we propose a predictive control approach
to constrained path-following problems with and without velocity assignments
and provide sufficient convergence conditions based on terminal regions and end
penalties. Furthermore, we analyze the geometric nature of constrained output
path-following problems and thereby provide insight into the computation of
suitable terminal control laws and terminal regions. We draw upon an example
from robotics to illustrate our findings.
