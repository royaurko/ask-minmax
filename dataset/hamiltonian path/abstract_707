A Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian submanifold of a Kaehler manifold is a
Lagrangian submanifold whose volume is stationary under Hamiltonian variations.
We find a sufficient condition on the curvature of a Kaehler manifold of real
dimension four that guarantees the existence of a family of small Hamiltonian
stationary Lagrangian tori.
