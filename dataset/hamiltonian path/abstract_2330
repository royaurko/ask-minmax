We show that a large class of dissipative systems can be brought to a
canonical form by introducing complex co-ordinates in phase space and a
complex-valued hamiltonian. A naive canonical quantization of these systems
lead to non-hermitean hamiltonian operators. The excited states are unstable
and decay to the ground state . We also compute the tunneling amplitude across
a potential barrier.
