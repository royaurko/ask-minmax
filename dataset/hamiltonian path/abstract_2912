Recently integral representations for the eigenfunctions of quadratic open
Toda chain Hamiltonians for classical groups was proposed. This representation
generalizes Givental representation for A_n. In this note we verify that the
wave functions defined by these integral representations are common
eigenfunctions for the complete set of open Toda chain Hamiltonians. We
consider the zero eigenvalue wave functions for classical groups C_n and D_n
thus completing the generalization of the Givental construction in these cases.
The construction is based on a recursive procedure and uses the formalism of
Baxter Q-operators. We also verify that the integral Q-operators for C_n, D_n
and twisted affine algebra A_{2n-1}^{(2)} proposed previously intertwine
complete sets of Hamiltonian operators. Finally we provide integral
representations of the eigenfunctions of the quadratic $D_n$ Toda chain
Hamiltonians for generic nonzero eigenvalues.
