The features of the paper are these:
  1) we discuss {\bf especially} quadratic (alias bilinear)
  Bose-Hamiltonians, the related Bogoliubov transformations and {\bf
especially} quasi-free-like (alias coherent or Fock-like) states 2) we discuss
{\bf any} quadratic Bose-Hamiltonians and Bogoliubov transformations, whether
diagonalizable or not, whether proper or improper, and {\bf arbitrary}
quasi-free-like states, whether regular or non-regular they are 3) we associate
notions and terms of the CCRs theory {CCRs = Canonical Commutation Relations}
with notions and terms of the indefinite inner product spaces theory. Then, we
apply the corresponding `bilingual dictionary' so as to construct invariant
states of some of the quadratic Hamiltonians.
