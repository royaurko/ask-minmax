We consider functional Schr\"{o}dinger equations associated with a wide class
of Hamiltonians in all Fock representations of the bosonic canonical
commutation relations, in particular the Cook-Fock, Friedrichs-Fock, and
Bargmann-Fock models. An infinite-dimensional symbolic calculus allows us to
prove the convergence of the corresponding Hamiltonian Feynman integrals for
propagators of coherent states.
