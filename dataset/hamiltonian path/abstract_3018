The coherent state path integral formulation of certain many particle systems
allows for their non perturbative study by the techniques of lattice field
theory. In this paper we exploit this strategy by simulating the explicit
example of the diffusion controlled reaction $A+A\to 0$. Our results are
consistent with some renormalization group-based predictions thus clarifying
the continuum limit of the action of the problem.
