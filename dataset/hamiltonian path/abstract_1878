We introduce type C parking functions, encoded as vertically labelled lattice
paths and endowed with a statistic dinv'. We define a bijection from type C
parking functions to regions of the Shi arrangement of type C, encoded as
diagonally labelled ballot paths and endowed with a natural statistic area'.
This bijection is a natural analogue of the zeta map of Haglund and Loehr and
maps dinv' to area'. We give three different descriptions of it.
