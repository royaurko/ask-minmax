The Lorentz gas is a model for a cloud of point particles (electrons) in a
distribution of scatterers in space. The scatterers are often assumed to be
spherical with a fixed diameter $d$, and the point particles move with constant
velocity between the scatterers, and are specularly reflected when hitting a
scatterer. There is no interaction between point particles. An interesting
question concerns the distribution of free path lengths, i.e. the distance a
point particle moves between the scattering events, and how this distribution
scales with scatterer diameter, scatterer density and the distribution of the
scatterers. It is by now well known that in the so-called Boltzmann-Grad limit,
a Poisson distribution of scatters leads to an exponential distribution of free
path lengths, whereas if the scatterer distribution is periodic, the
distribution of free path behaves asymptotically like a Cauchy distribution.
  This paper considers the case when the scatters are distributed on a quasi
crystal, i.e. non periodically, but with a long range order. Simulations of a
one-dimensional model are presented, showing that the quasi crystal behaves
very much like a periodic crystal, and in particular, the distribution of free
path lengths is not exponential.
