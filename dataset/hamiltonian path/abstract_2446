Generalizing a result of Conway, Sloane, and Wilkes for real reflection
groups, we show the Cayley graph of an imprimitive complex reflection group
with respect to standard generating reflections has a Hamiltonian cycle. This
is consistent with the long-standing conjecture that for every finite group, G,
and every set of generators, S, of G the undirected Cayley graph of G with
respect to S has a Hamiltonian cycle.
