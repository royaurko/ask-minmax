We make Hamiltonian analyses of the new set of dual bosonic $p$-brane
(including string) actions which contain high non-linearity. The difficulties
exist in two basic steps of the Hamiltonian procedure, that is, in calculating
canonical momenta and in solving velocities in terms of momenta. The former
difficulty can be overcome by an ADM reparametrization of induced metrics,
while the latter may be circumvented by some modification to the usual
Hamiltonian procedure. We also compare our results with that of the other set
composed of known dual $p$-brane actions.
