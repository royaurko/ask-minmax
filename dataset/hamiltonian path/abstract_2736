We present functional Schr\"odinger representations of Holstein-Primakoff
boson and slave-boson theories for the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and the $t-J$
Hamiltonian respectively. Based on these representations we obtain the
dispersion relations of magnons for two dimensional antiferromagnets. By
applying the functional Schr\"odinger representation of the Holstein-Primakoff
boson theory to the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, the exchange energy is correctly
predicted and the self-energy of quasi-hole is obtained. From the use of the
functional Schr\"odinger representation of the $t-J$ Hamiltonian it is shown
that at half-filling the dispersion relation obtained from the slave-boson
theory leads to that obtained from the Holstein-Primakoff boson approach.
