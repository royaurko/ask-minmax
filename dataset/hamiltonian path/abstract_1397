The $r$-KdV-CH hierarchy is a generalization of the Korteweg-de Vries and
Camassa-Holm hierarchies parametrized by $r+1$ constants. In this paper we
clarify some properties of its multi-Hamiltonian structures, prove the
semisimplicity of the associated bihamiltonian structures and the formula for
their central invariants. By introducing a class of generalized Hamiltonian
structures, we give in a natural way the transformation formulae of the
Hamiltonian structures of the hierarchy under certain reciprocal
transformation, and prove the formulae at the level of its dispersionless
limit. We also consider relations of the associated bihamiltonian structures to
Frobenius manifolds.
