We extend the usual notion of parallel transport along a path to triangulated
surfaces. A homotopy of paths is lifted into a fibered category with connection
and this defines a functor between the fibers above the boundary paths. These
"sweeping functors" transport fiber bundles with connection along a surface
whereas usual connections transport a group element along a path. We show that
to get rid of the parametrization, we must use Abelian degrees of freedom. In
the general, non-Abelian case, we conjecture that the smooth limit of this
construction provides us with representations of the group of diffeomorphisms
of the swept surface. Applications to gauge theories are proposed.
