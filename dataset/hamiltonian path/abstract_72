Recently a path integral formalism has been proposed by the contributor which
gives the time evolution of moments of slow variables in a Hamiltonian
statistical system. That formalism is extended here to deal with a more general
autonomous dynamical system. An immediate practical application to forced
dissipative turbulent systems is thus now possible.
