We study side-lengths of triangles in path metric spaces. We prove that
unless such a space X is bounded, or quasi-isometric to line or half-line,
every triple of real numbers satisfying the strict triangle inequalities, is
realized by the side-lengths of a triangle in X. We construct an example of a
complete path metric space quasi-isometric to the Euclidean plane, for which
every degenerate triangle has one side which is shorter than a certain uniform
constant.
