We derive the Helmholtz theorem for Hamiltonian systems defined on time
scales in the context of nonshifted calculus of variations which encompass the
discrete and continuous case. Precisely, we give a theorem characterizing first
order equation on time scales, admitting a Hamiltonian formulation which is
defined with non-shifted calculus of variation. Moreover, in the affirmative
case, we give the associated Hamiltonian.
