We consider the fractal dimensions d_k of the k-connected part of percolation
clusters in two dimensions, generalizing the cluster (k=1) and backbone (k=2)
dimensions. The codimensions X_k = 2-d_k describe the asymptotic decay of the
probabilities P(r,R) ~ (r/R)^{X_k} that an annulus of radii r<<1 and R>>1 is
traversed by k disjoint paths, all living on the percolation clusters. Using a
transfer matrix approach, we obtain numerical results for X_k, k<=6. They are
well fitted by the Ansatz X_k = 1/12 k^2 + 1/48 k + (1-k)C, with C =
0.0181+-0.0006.
