For a class of second-order discrete Hamiltonian systems
$\Delta^2x(t-1)-L(t)x(t)+V'_x(t,x(t))=0$, we investigate the existence of
homoclinic orbits by applying variational method, where $L$ and $V(\cdot,x)$
are periodic functions. Further, we show that there exist either uncountable
many homoclinic orbits or multibump solutions under certain conditions.
