We give a Hamiltonian based interpretation of microscopic Fermi liquid theory
within a renormalization group framework. We identify the fixed point
Hamiltonian of Fermi liquid theory, with the leading order corrections, and
show that this Hamiltonian in mean field theory gives the Landau
phenomenological theory. A renormalized perturbation theory is developed for
calculations beyond the Fermi liquid regime. We also briefly discuss the
breakdown of Fermi liquid theory as it occurs in the Luttinger model, and the
infinite dimensional Hubbard model at the Mott transition.
