The generalized Stokes theorem (connecting integrals of dimensions 3 and 4)
is formulated in a curved space-time in terms of paths in Minkowski space
(forming Path Group). A covariant integral form of the conservation law for the
energy-momentum of matter is then derived in General Relativity. It extends
Einstein's equivalence principle on the energy conservation, since it
formulates the conservation law for the energy-momentum of matter without
explicit including the gravitational field in the formulation.
