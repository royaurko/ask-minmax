We solve the massless Schwinger model exactly in Hamiltonian formalism on a
circle. We construct physical states explicitly and discuss the role of the
spectral flow and nonperturbative vacua. Different thermodynamical correlation
functions are calculated and after performing the analytical continuation are
compared with the corresponding expressions obtained for the Schwinger model on
the torus in Euclidean Path Integral formalism obtained before.
