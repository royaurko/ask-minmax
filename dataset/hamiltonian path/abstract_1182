Bi-Hamiltonian structures involving Hamiltonian operators of degree 2 are
studied. Firstly, pairs of degree 2 operators are considered in terms of an
algebra structure on the space of 1-forms, related to so-called Fermionic
Novikov algebras. Then, degree 2 operators are considered as deformations of
hydrodynamic type Poisson brackets.
