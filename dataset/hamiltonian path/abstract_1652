Let G be a graph with n vertices and mu(G) be the largest eigenvalue of the
adjacency matrix of G. We study how large mu(G) can be when G does not contain
cycles and paths of specified order. In particular, we determine the maximum
spectral radius of graphs without paths of given length, and give tight bounds
on the spectral radius of graphs without given even cycles. We also raise a
number of natural open problems.
