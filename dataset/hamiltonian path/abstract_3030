We calculate the local density of states (LDOS) of a superconductor-normal
metal sandwich at arbitrary impurity concentration. The presence of the
superconductor induces a gap in the normal metal spectrum that is proportional
to the inverse of the elastic mean free path $l$ for rather clean systems. For
a mean free path much shorter than the thickness of the normal metal, we find a
gap size proportional to $l$ that approaches the behavior predicted by the
Usadel equation (diffusive limit).
