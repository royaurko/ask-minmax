In this paper, we study the regular point reduction of a regular controlled
Hamiltonian system with magnetic symplectic form and the symmetry of the
Heisenberg group. We give the reduced regular controlled Hamiltonian system on
the generalization of coadjoint orbit of the Heisenberg group by calculation in
detail, and discuss the magnetic reducible controlled Hamiltonian (MRCH)
equivalence. As an application, we consider the motion of the Heisenberg
particle in a magnetic field.
