Coherent state path integrals are shown in general to contain instantons with
jumps at the boundaries, i.e., with boundary points lying outside classical
parameter or phase space. As an example, the magnetic molecule Fe_8 is studied
using a realistic Hamiltonian, and instanons with jumps are shown to dominate
beyond a certain external magnetic field. An approximate formula is found for
the fields where ground state tunneling is quenched in this molecule.
