In this paper we prove the derivative process of a rough differential
equation driven by Brownian rough path has finite $L^r$-moment for any $r /ge
1$. Thanks to Burkholder-Davis-Gundy's inequality, this kind of problem is easy
in the usual SDE theory. In the context of rough path theory, however, it does
not seem so obvious.
