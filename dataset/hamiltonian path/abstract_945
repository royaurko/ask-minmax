We construct a quasi-sure version (in the sense of Malliavin) of geometric
rough paths associated with a Gaussian process with long-time memory. As an
application we establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for capacities for
such Gaussian rough paths. Together with Lyons' universal limit theorem, our
results yield immediately the corresponding results for pathwise solutions to
stochastic differential equations driven by such Gaussian process in the sense
of rough paths. Moreover, our LDP result implies the result of Yoshida on the
LDP for capacities over the abstract Wiener space associated with such Gaussian
process.
