Charge transfer in homogeneous nucleotide chains is modeled on the basis of
Holstein Hamiltonian. The path length of Davydov solitons in these chains is
being studied. It is shown that in a dispersionless case, when the soliton
velocity V is small, the path length grows exponentially as V decreases. In
this case the state of a moving soliton is quasisteady. In the presence of
dispersion determined by the dependence $\Omega^2 = \Omega_0^2 + V_0^2\kappa^2$
\, the path length in the region 0 < V < V_0 is equal to infinity. In this case
the phonon environment follows the charge motion. In the region V > V_0 the
soliton motion is accompanied by emission of phonons which leads to a finite
path length of a soliton. The latter tends to infinity as $V \rightarrow V_0 +
0$ and $V \rightarrow \infty$. The presence of dissipation leads to a finite
soliton path length. An equilibrium velocity of soliton in an external electric
field is calculated. It is shown that there is a maximum intensity of an
electric field at which a steady motion of a soliton is possible. The soliton
mobility is calculated for the stable or ohmic brunch.
