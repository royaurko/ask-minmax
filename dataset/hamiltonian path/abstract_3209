Two experiments were made using a microwave generator, which sent a narrow
beam, through a metallic plate with horizontal movement. At the other end a
horn antenna coupled to a field-strength detector. In linear polarization
double cycloids paths were found and in circular polarization spiral paths were
found. These experiments suggested that the photon is composed by two particles
in dynamic equilibrium. The description of this model is given later as well as
its parameters.
