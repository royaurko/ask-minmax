The connection between four different approaches to quantization of the
relativistic particle is studied: reduced phase space quantization, Dirac
quantization, BRST quantization, and (BRST)-Fock quantization are each carried
out. The connection to the BFV path integral in phase space is provided. In
particular, it is concluded that that the full range of the lapse should be
used in such path integrals. The relationship between all these approaches is
established.
