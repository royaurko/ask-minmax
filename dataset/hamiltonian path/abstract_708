The Mishchenko-Fomenko theorem on superintegrable Hamiltonian systems is
generalized to superintegrable Hamiltonian systems with noncompact invariant
submanifolds. It is formulated in the case of globally superintegrable
Hamiltonian systems which admit global generalized action-angle coordinates.
The well known Kepler system falls into two different globally superintegrable
systems with compact and noncompact invariant submanifolds.
