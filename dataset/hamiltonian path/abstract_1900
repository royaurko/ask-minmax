We present results from Molecular Dynamics simulations of the thermal glass
transition in a dense polymer melt. In previous work we compared the simulation
data with the idealized version of mode coupling theory (MCT) and found that
the theory provides a good description of the dynamics above the critical
temperature. In order to investigate the influence of different thermodynamic
paths on the structural relaxation (alpha-process), we performed simulations
for three different pressures and are thus able to give a sketch of the
critical line of MCT in the pressure-temperature-plane [(p,T)-plane], where,
according to the idealised version of MCT, an ergodic-nonergodic transition
should occur. Furthermore, by cooling our system along two different paths (an
isobar and an isochor), with the same impact point on the critical line, we
demonstrate that neither the critical temperature nor the exponent gamma depend
on the chosen path.
