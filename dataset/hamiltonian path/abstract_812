In 1974, Goodman and Hedetniemi proved that every 2-connected
$(K_{1,3},K_{1,3}+e)$-free graph is hamiltonian. This result gave rise many
other hamiltonicity conditions for various pairs and triples of forbidden
connected subgraphs under additional connectivity conditions. In 1997, it was
proved that a single forbidden connected subgraph $R$ in 2-connected graphs can
create only a trivial class of hamiltonian graphs (complete graphs) with
$R=P_3$. In this paper we prove that a single forbidden subgraph $R$ can create
a non trivial class of hamiltonian graphs if $R$ is disconnected: $(\ast1)$
every $(K_1\cup P_2)$-free graph either is hamiltonian or belongs to a well
defined class of non hamiltonian graphs; $(\ast2)$ every 1-tough $(K_1\cup
P_3)$-free graph is hamiltonian. We conjecure that every 1-tough $(K_1\cup
P_4)$-free graph is hamiltonian and every 1-tough $P_4$-free graph is
hamiltonian
