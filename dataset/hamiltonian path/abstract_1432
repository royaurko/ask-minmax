We resolve a problem of finding the Poincare symmetries from hamiltonian
gauge symmetries constructed through a canonical procedure of handling
constrained systems. Through the use of Noether identities corresponding to the
symmetries, we motivate a procedure of finding the map between the hamiltonian
and Poincare gauge parameters. Using this map, we show that the Poincare and
hamiltonian gauge symmetries are equivalent, modulo trivial gauge
transformations.
