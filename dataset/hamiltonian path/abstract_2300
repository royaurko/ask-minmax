For the Davey-Stewartson I equation, which is an integrable equation in 1+2
dimensions, we have already found its Lax pair in 1+1 dimensional form by
nonlinear constraints. This paper deals with the second nonlinearization of
this 1+1 dimensional system to get three 1+0 dimensional Hamiltonian systems
with a constraint of Neumann type. The full set of involutive conserved
integrals is obtained and their functional independence is proved. Therefore,
the Hamiltonian systems are completely integrable in Liouville sense. A
periodic solution of the Davey-Stewartson I equation is obtained by solving
these classical Hamiltonian systems as an example.
