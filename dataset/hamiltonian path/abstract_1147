Consistent couplings among a set of scalar fields, two types of one-forms and
a system of two-forms are investigated in the light of the Hamiltonian BRST
cohomology, giving a four-dimensional nonlinear gauge theory. The emerging
interactions deform the first-class constraints, the Hamiltonian gauge algebra,
as well as the reducibility relations.
