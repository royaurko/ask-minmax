Circular dichroism (CD) is in widespread use as a means of determining
enantiomeric excess. We show how slow-light phenomena in dispersive structured
media allow for a reduction in the required optical path length of an order of
magnitude. The same ideas may be used to enhance the sensitivity of CD
measurements while maintaining the same optical path length through the sample.
Finally, the sensitivity may be enhanced in frequency regimes where CD data is
typically not accessible due to a modest chiral response of the enantiomers.
