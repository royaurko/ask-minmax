We study supersymmetry breaking in the lattice N=1 Wess-Zumino model by the
world-line path integral algorithm. The ground state energy and supersymmetric
Ward identities are exploited to support the expected symmetry breaking in
finite volume. Non-Gaussian fluctuations of the topological charge are
discussed and related to the infinite volume transition.
