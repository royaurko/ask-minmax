Consider a weighted graph G with n vertices, numbered by the set {1,...,n}.
For any path p in G, we call w_G(p) the sum of the weights of the edges of the
path and we define the multiset {\cal D}_{i,j} (G) = {w_G(p) | p simple path
between i and j} We establish a criterion to say when, given a multisubset of
the set of the real numbers there exists a weighted complete graph G such that
the multisubset is equal to {\cal D}_{i,j} (G) for some i,j vertices of G.
Besides we establish a criterion to say when, given for any i, j in {1,...,n} a
multisubset of the set of the real numbers,{\cal D}_{i,j}, there exists a
weighted complete graph G with vertices {1,...,n} such that {\cal D}_{i,j} (G)=
{\cal D}_{i,j} for any i,j.
