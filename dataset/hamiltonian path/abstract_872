For two-dimensional last-passage time models of weakly increasing paths,
interesting scaling limits have been proved for points close the axis (the hard
edge). For strictly increasing paths of Bernoulli($p$) marked sites, the
relevant boundary is the line $y=px$. We call this the soft edge to contrast it
with the hard edge. We prove laws of large numbers for the maximal cardinality
of a strictly increasing path in the rectangle $[\fl{p^{-1}n -xn^a}]\times[n]$
as the parameters $a$ and $x$ vary. The results change qualitatively as $a$
passes through the value 1/2.
