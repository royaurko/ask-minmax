In this paper, we develop the theoretical foundations of discrete Dirac
mechanics, that is, discrete mechanics of degenerate Lagrangian/Hamiltonian
systems with constraints. We first construct discrete analogues of Tulczyjew's
triple and induced Dirac structures by considering the geometry of symplectic
maps and their associated generating functions. We demonstrate that this
framework provides a means of deriving discrete Lagrange-Dirac and nonholonomic
Hamiltonian systems. In particular, this yields nonholonomic Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian integrators. We also introduce discrete
Lagrange-d'Alembert-Pontryagin and Hamilton-d'Alembert variational principles,
which provide an alternative derivation of the same set of integration
algorithms. The paper provides a unified treatment of discrete Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian mechanics in the more general setting of discrete Dirac mechanics,
as well as a generalization of symplectic and Poisson integrators to the
broader category of Dirac integrators.
