The Euler graph has vertices labelled (n,k) for n=0,1,2,... and k=0,1,...,n,
with k+1 edges from (n,k) to (n+1,k) and n-k+1 edges from (n,k) to (n+1,k+1).
The number of paths from (0,0) to (n,k) is the Eulerian number A(n,k), the
number of permutations of 1,2,...,n+1 with exactly n-k falls and k rises. We
prove that the adic (Bratteli-Vershik) transformation on the space of infinite
paths in this graph is ergodic with respect to the symmetric measure.
