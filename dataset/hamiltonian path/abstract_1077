For a 3-manifold $M$ with $b_1(M)=1$ fibered over $S^1$ and the fiberwise
gradient $\xi$ of a fiberwise Morse function on $M$, we introduce the notion of
amidakuji-like path (AL-path) on $M$. An AL-path is a piecewise smooth path on
$M$ consisting of edges each of which is either a part of a critical locus of
$\xi$ or a flow line of $-\xi$. Counting closed AL-paths with signs gives the
Lefschetz zeta function of $M$. The "moduli space" of AL-paths on $M$ gives
explicitly Lescop's equivariant propagator, which can be used to define
$\mathbb{Z}$-equivariant version of Chern--Simons perturbation theory for $M$.
