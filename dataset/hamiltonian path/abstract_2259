It is shown that several Hamiltonian systems possessing dynamical or hidden
symmetries can be realized within the framework of Nambu's generalized
mechanics. Among such systems are the SU(n)-isotropic harmonic oscillator and
the SO(4)-Kepler problem. As required by the formulation of Nambu dynamics, the
integrals of motion for these systems necessarily become the so-called
generalized Hamiltonians. Furthermore, in most of these problems, the
definition of these generalized Hamiltonians is not unique.
