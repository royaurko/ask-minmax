This study propose a continuous pathfinding system based on coupled
oscillator systems. We consider acyclic graphs whose vertices are connected by
unidirectional edges. The proposed model autonomously finds a path connecting
two specified vertices, and the path is represented by phase-synchronized
oscillatory solutions. To develop a system capable of self-recovery, that is, a
system with the ability to find a path when one of the connections in the
existing path is suddenly removed, we implemented three-state Boolean-like
regulatory rules for interaction functions. We also demonstrate that
appropriate installation of inhibitory interaction improves the finding time.
