Stars near the Galactic center reach a few percent of light speed during
pericenter passage, which makes post-Newtonian effects potentially detectable.
We formulate the orbit equations in Hamiltonian form such that the $O(v^2/c^2)$
and $O(v^3/c^3)$ post-Newtonian effects of the Kerr metric appear as a simple
generalization of the Kepler problem. A related perturbative Hamiltonian
applies to photon paths. We then derive a symplectic integrator with adaptive
time-steps, for fast and accurate numerical calculation of post-Newtonian
effects. Using this integrator, we explore relativistic effects. Taking the
star S2 as an example, we find that general relativity would contribute tenths
of mas in astrometry and tens of $\rm km s^{-1}$ in kinematics. (For eventual
comparison with observations, redshift and time-delay contributions from the
gravitational field on light paths will need to be calculated, but we do
attempt these in the present paper.) The contribution from stars, gas, and dark
matter in the Galactic center region is still poorly constrained
observationally, but current models suggest that the resulting Newtonian
perturbation on the orbits could plausibly be of the same order as the
relativistic effects for stars with semi-major axes $\gtrsim 0.01$ pc (or 250
mas). Nevertheless, the known and distinctive {\it time dependence} of the
relativistic perturbations may make it possible to disentangle and extract both
effects from observations.
