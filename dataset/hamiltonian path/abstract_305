Let $K_{n}^{c}$ denote a complete graph on $n$ vertices whose edges are
colored in an arbitrary way. Let $\Delta^{\mathrm{mon}} (K_{n}^{c})$ denote the
maximum number of edges of the same color incident with a vertex of
$K_{n}^{c}$. A properly colored cycle (path) in $K_{n}^{c}$ is a cycle (path)
in which adjacent edges have distinct colors. B. Bollob\'{a}s and P. Erd\"{o}s
(1976) proposed the following conjecture: if $\Delta^{\mathrm{mon}}
(K_{n}^{c})<\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$, then $K_{n}^{c}$ contains a properly
colored Hamiltonian cycle. Li, Wang and Zhou proved that if
$\Delta^{\mathrm{mon}} (K_{n}^{c})< \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$, then
$K_{n}^{c}$ contains a properly colored cycle of length at least $\lceil
\frac{n+2}{3}\rceil+1$. In this paper, we improve the bound to $\lceil
\frac{n}{2}\rceil + 2$.
