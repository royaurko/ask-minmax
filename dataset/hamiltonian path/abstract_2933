In earlier works on Shape Dynamics (SD), a linear method of solving a
particular set of Lichnerowicz-type equations through the implicit function
theorem was developed in order to implicitly construct SD's global Hamiltonian
and eliminate second class constraints. This method was later used for
extending Shape Dynamics (SD) to the non-vacuum case, showing how other fields
are coupled to the theory. In that study it was found that unlike the vacuum
case the use of such methods yielded puzzling bounds on the density of some
types of fields. Here we show that the original SD cannot be extended beyond
such bounds, but that a slight modification of the original can withstand any
type of coupling. When the bound is broken, the theory does not come equipped
with a single Hamiltonian as in vacuum SD, but with a finite set of weakly
commuting Hamiltonians, which we describe.
