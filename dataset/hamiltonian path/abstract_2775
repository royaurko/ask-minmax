We present the Hamiltonian formulation of the bosonic Dirichlet p-brane
action. We rewrite the recently proposed quadratic D-brane action in terms of
generalized shift vector and lapse function. The first class and the second
class constraints are explicitly separated for the bosonic case. We then impose
the gauge conditions in such a way that only time-independent gauge
transformations are left. In this gauge we obtain the light-cone Hamiltonian
which is quadratic in the field momenta of scalar and vector fields. The
constraints are explicitly solved to eliminate part of the canonical variables.
The Dirac brackets between the remaining variables are computed and shown to be
equal to simple Poisson brackets.
