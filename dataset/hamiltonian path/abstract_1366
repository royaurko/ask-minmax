The equations of classical spin-orbit motion can be extended to a Hamiltonian
system in 9-dimensional phase space by introducing a coupled spin-orbit Poisson
bracket and a Hamiltonian function. After this extension and by establishing
connections between initial and extended systems it becomes possible to apply
the methods of the theory of Hamiltonian systems to the study of polarized
particle beam dynamics in circular accelerators and storage rings. Some of
those methods have been implemented in the computer code FORGET-ME-NOT.
