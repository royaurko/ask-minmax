We argue here that, as it happens in Classical and Quantum Mechanics, where
it has been proven that alternative Hamiltonian descriptions can be compatible
with a given set of equations of motion, the same holds true in the realm of
Statistical Mechanics, i.e. that alternative Hamiltonian descriptions do lead
to the same thermodynamical description of any physical system.
