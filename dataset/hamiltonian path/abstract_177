We consider a Hamiltonian involving the range of the simple random walk and
the Wiener sausage so that the walk tends to stretch itself. This Hamiltonian
can be easily extended to the multidimensional cases, since the Wiener sausage
is well-defined in any dimension. In dimension one, we give a formula for the
speed and the spread of the endpoint of the polymer path. It can be easily
showed that if the self-repelling strength is stronger, the end point is going
away faster. This monotonicity of speed has not been proven in the literature
for the one-dimensional case.
