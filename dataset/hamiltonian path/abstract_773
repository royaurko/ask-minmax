In this paper, we give a numerical method for pricing long maturity, path
dependent options by using the Markov property for each underlying asset. This
enables us to approximate a path dependent option by using some kinds of plain
vanillas. We give some examples whose underlying assets behave as some popular
Levy processes. Moreover, we give some payoffs and functions used to
approximate them.
