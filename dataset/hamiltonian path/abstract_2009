The path lengths of monochromatic muons emerging in the $\pi \to \mu\nu_{\mu}
$ decay were measured by the coordinate method with the view to determine their
energy by path length. The dispersion of muon energy measurements by this
method was $ \sigma_{\mu} = (0.11 \pm 0.01)$ MeV, which corresponds to the
accuracy of $ \sigma \approx 2.7%$ of the energy of a charged particle
estimated by its path length in nuclear emulsion. The developed method will
enable measurements of electron energies in $2\beta $ decay ($\sim 3$ MeV) to
an accuracy of $ \sigma \approx 5%$.
