The transparent way for the invariant (Hamiltonian) description of
equivariant localization of the integrals over phase space is proposed. It uses
the odd symplectic structure, constructed over tangent bundle of the phase
space and permits straightforward generalization for the path integrals.
Simultaneously the method of supersymmetrization for a wide class of the
Hamiltonian systems is derived.
