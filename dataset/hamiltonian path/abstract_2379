The objective of this note is to prove an existence result for brake orbits
in classical Hamiltonian systems (which was first proved by S.V.Bolotin) by
using Floer theory. To this end, we compute an open string analogue of
symplectic homology (so called wrapped Floer homology) of some domains in
cotangent bundles, which appear naturally in the study of classical Hamiltonian
systems. The main part of the computations is to show invariance of wrapped
Floer homology under certain handle attaching to domains.
