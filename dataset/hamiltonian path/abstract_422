Codd [Codd 1970] wrote the first paper in which the model of a relational
database was proposed. Adleman [Adleman 1994] wrote the first paper in which
DNA strands in a test tube were used to solve an instance of the Hamiltonian
path problem. From [Adleman 1994], it is obviously indicated that for storing
information in molecules of DNA allows for an information density of
approximately 1 bit per cubic nm (nanometer) and a dramatic improvement over
existing storage media such as video tape which store information at a density
of approximately 1 bit per 1012 cubic nanometers. This paper demonstrates that
biological operations can be applied to construct bio-molecular databases where
data records in relational tables are encoded as DNA strands. In order to
achieve the goal, DNA algorithms are proposed to perform eight operations of
relational algebra (calculus) on bio-molecular relational databases, which
include Cartesian product, union, set difference, selection, projection,
intersection, join and division. Furthermore, this work presents clear evidence
of the ability of molecular computing to perform data retrieval operations on
bio-molecular relational databases.
