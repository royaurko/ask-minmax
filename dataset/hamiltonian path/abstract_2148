Nonrelativistic Hamiltonians with large, even infinite, ground-state
degeneracy are studied by connecting the degeneracy to the property of a Dirac
operator. We then identify a special class of Hamiltonians, for which the full
space of degenerate ground states in any spatial dimension can be exhibited
explicitly. The two-dimensional version of the latter coincides with the Pauli
Hamiltonian, and recently-discussed models leading to higher-dimensional Landau
levels are obtained as special cases of the higher-dimensional version of this
Hamiltonian. But, in our framework, it is only the asymptotic behavior of the
background `potential' that matters for the ground-state degeneracy. We work
out in detail the ground states of the three-dimensional model in the presence
of a uniform magnetic field and such potential. In the latter case one can see
degenerate stacking of all 2d Landau levels along the magnetic field axis.
