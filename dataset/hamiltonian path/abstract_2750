This paper generalizes earlier work on Hamiltonian boundary terms by omitting
the requirement that the spacelike hypersurfaces $\Sigma_t$ intersect the
timelike boundary $\cal B$ orthogonally. The expressions for the action and
Hamiltonian are calculated and the required subtraction of a background
contribution is discussed. The new features of a Hamiltonian formulation with
non-orthogonal boundaries are then illustrated in two examples.
