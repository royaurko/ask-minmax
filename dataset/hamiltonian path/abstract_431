In this paper a new approach is proposed to quantize mechanical systems whose
equations of motion can not be put into Hamiltonian form. This approach is
based on a new type of variational principle, which is adopted to a describe a
relation: a damping particle may shares a common phase curve with a free
particle, whose Lagrangian in the new variational principle can be considered
as a Lagrangian density in phase space. According to Feynman's theory, the
least action principle is adopted to modify the Feynman's path integral
formula, where Lagrangian is replaced by Lagrangian density. In the case of
conservative systems, the modification reduces to standard Feynman's propagator
formula. As an example a particle with friction is analyzed in detail.
