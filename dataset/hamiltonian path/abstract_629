A method for calculating the relativistic path integral solution via sum over
perturbation series is given. As an application the exact path integral
solution of the relativistic Aharonov-Bohm-Coulomb system is obtained by the
method. Different from the earlier treatment based on the space-time
transformation and infinite multiple-valued trasformation of
Kustaanheimo-Stiefel in order to perform path integral, the method developed in
this contribution involves only the explicit form of a simple Green's function
and an explicit path integral is avoided.
