The aim of this article is to develop an explicit procedure that enables one
to reconstruct any C^1 path (when parametrized at uniform speed) from its
signature. A key ingredient in the construction is the use of symmetrization
that separates the behavior of the path at small and large scales. We also give
detailed stability properties of our inversion procedure.
