An effective electronic Hamiltonian for transition metal oxide compounds is
presented. For Mn-oxides, the Hamiltonian contains spin-2 ``spins'' and
spin-3/2 ``holes'' as degrees of freedom. The model is constructed from the
Kondo-lattice Hamiltonian for mobile $e_g$ electrons and localized $t_{2g}$
spins, in the limit of a large Hund's coupling. The effective electron bond
hopping amplitude fluctuates in sign as the total spin of the bond changes. In
the large spin limit, the hopping amplitude for electrons aligned with the core
ions is complex and a Berry phase is accumulated when these electrons move in
loops. The new model is compared with the standard double exchange Hamiltonian.
Both have ferromagnetic ground states at finite hole density and low
temperatures, but their critical temperatures could be substantially different
due to the frustration effects induced by the Berry phase.
