For spin-polarized junctions of ferromagnetically contacting multiple
conductive paths, such as ferromagnet (FM)/atomic wires/FM and FM/carbon
nanotubes/FM junctions, we theoretically investigate spin-dependent transport
to elucidate the intrinsic relation between the number of paths and conduction,
and to enhance the magnetoresistance (MR) ratio. When many paths are randomly
located between the two FMs, electronic wave interference between the FMs
appears, and then the MR ratio increases with increasing number of paths.
Furthermore, at each number of paths, the MR ratio for carbon nanotubes becomes
larger than that for atomic wires, reflecting the characteristic shape of
points in contact with the FM.
