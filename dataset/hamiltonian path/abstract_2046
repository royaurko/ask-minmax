High school and college graduates seemingly are often battling for the
courses they should major in order to achieve their target career. In this
paper, we worked on suggesting a career path to a graduate to reach his/her
dream career given the current educational status. Firstly, we collected the
career data of professionals and academicians from various career fields and
compiled the data set by using the necessary information from the data.
Further, this was used as the basis to suggest the most appropriate career path
for the person given his/her current educational status. Decision trees and
string matching algorithms were employed to suggest the appropriate career path
for a person. Finally, an analysis of the result has been done directing to
further improvements in the model.
