We study the unstable spectrum close to the imaginary axis for the
linearization of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation about a periodic traveling
wave in a co-moving frame. We define dynamical Hamiltonian-Hopf instabilities
as points in the stable spectrum that are accumulation points for unstable
spectrum, and show how they can be determined from the knowledge of the
discriminant of an associated Hill's equation. This result allows us to give
simple criteria for the existence of dynamical Hamiltonian-Hopf instabilities
in terms of instability indices previously shown to be useful in stability
analysis of periodic traveling waves.
