While dealing in [1] with the supersymmetry of a tridiagonal Hamiltonian H,
we have proved that its partner Hamiltonian H(+) also have a tridiagonal matrix
representation in the same basis and that the polynomials associated with the
eigenstates expansion of H(+) are precisely the kernel polynomials of those
associated with H. This formalism is here applied to the case of the Morse
oscillator which may have a finite discrete energy spectrum in addition to a
continuous one. This completes the treatment of tridiagonal Hamiltonians with
pure continuous energy spectrum, a pure discrete one, or a spectrum of mixed
discrete and continous parts.
