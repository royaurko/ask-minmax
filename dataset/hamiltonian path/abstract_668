After a brief survey of the definition and the properties of
Lambda-symmetries in the general context of dynamical systems, the notion of
"Lambda-constant of motion'' for Hamiltonian equations is introduced. If the
Hamiltonian problem is derived from a Lambda-invariant Lagrangian, it is shown
how the Lagrangian Lambda-invariance can be transferred into the Hamiltonian
context and shown that the Hamiltonian equations turn out to be
Lambda-symmetric. Finally, the "partial'' (Lagrangian) reduction of the
Euler-Lagrange equations is compared with the reduction obtained for the
corresponding Hamiltonian equations.
