We study the low temperature behaviour of path integrals for a simple
one-dimensional model. Starting from the Feynman-Kac formula, we derive a new
functional representation of the density matrix at finite temperature, in terms
of the occupation times of Brownian motions constrained to stay within boxes
with finite sizes. From that representation, we infer a kind of ergodic
approximation, which only involves double ordinary integrals. As shown by its
applications to different confining potentials, the ergodic approximation turns
out to be quite efficient, especially in the low-temperature regime where other
usual approximations fail.
