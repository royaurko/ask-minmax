We discuss system with non-isotropic non-Heisenberg Hamiltonian with nearest
neighbor exchange within a mean field approximation process. We drive equations
describing non-Heisenberg non-isotropic model using coherent states in real
parameters and then obtain dispersion equations of spin wave of dipole and
quadrupole branches for a small linear excitation from the ground state. In
final, soliton solution for quadrupole branches for these linear equations
obtained.
