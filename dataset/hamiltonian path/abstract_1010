In the present paper correspondence between non-Noether symmetries and
bi-Hamiltonian structures is disscussed. We show that in regular Hamiltonian
systems presence of the global bi-Hamiltonian structure is caused by symmetry
of the space of solution. As an example well known bi-Hamiltonian realisation
of Korteweg- De Vries equation is disscussed.
