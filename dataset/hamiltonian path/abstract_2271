We show that for a natural polynomial Hamiltonian system the existence of a
single Darboux polynomial (a partial polynomial first integral) is equivalent
to the existence of an additional first integral functionally independent with
the Hamiltonian function. Moreover, we show that, in a case when the degree of
potential is odd, the system does not admit any proper Darboux polynomial,
i.e., the only Darboux polynomials are first integrals.
