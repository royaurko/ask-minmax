We examine the analytical structure of the nonlinear Lienard oscillator and
show that it is a bi-Hamiltonian system depending upon the choice of the
coupling parameters. While one has been recently studied in the context of a
quantized momentum- dependent mass system, the other Hamiltonian also reflects
a similar feature in the mass function and also depicts an isotonic character.
We solve for such a Hamiltonian and give the complete solution in terms of a
confluent hypergeometric function.
