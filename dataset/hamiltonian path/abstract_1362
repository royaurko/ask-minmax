We present a method of localised control of chaos in Hamiltonian systems. The
aim is to modify the perturbation locally by a small control term which makes
the controlled Hamiltonian more regular. We provide an explicit expression for
the control term which is able to recreate invariant (KAM) tori without
modifying other parts of phase space. We apply this method of localised control
to a forced pendulum model, to the delta-kicked rotor (standard map) and to a
non-twist Hamiltonian.
