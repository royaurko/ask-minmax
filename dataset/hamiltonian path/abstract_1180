The energy spectrum of eigenvalues of the equal spin-spin interactions (ESSI)
Hamiltonian has been found. The obtained spectrum is free from limitations
imposed on number of spins and parameters of the ESSI Hamiltonian. This model
can be used for consideration of spin dynamics of mesoscopic systems and
molecules with large number of nuclei spins.
