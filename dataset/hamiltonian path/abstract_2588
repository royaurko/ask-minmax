We construct Poisson structures for Ermakov systems, using the Ermakov
invariant as the Hamiltonian. Two classes of Poisson structures are obtained,
one of them degenerate, in which case we derive the Casimir functions. In some
situations, the existence of Casimir functions can give rise to superintegrable
Ermakov systems. Finally, we characterize the cases where linearization of the
equations of motion is possible.
