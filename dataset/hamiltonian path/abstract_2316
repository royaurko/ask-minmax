Supersymmetrical quantum--mechanical system is consider in the case of d=2.
The problem of addition of the lower level to spectrums of matrix and scalar
components of d=2 SUSY Hamiltonian is investigated. It is shown that in the
case, the level E=0 may be degenerate. The multi--dimensional scalar
Hamiltonians with energy spectra coinciding up to finite number of discrete
levels are constructed.
