We apply the antifield quantization method of Batalin and Vilkovisky to the
calculation of the path integral for the Poisson-Sigma model in a general
gauge. For a linear Poisson structure the model reduces to a nonabelian gauge
theory, and we obtain the formula for the partition function of two-dimensional
Yang-Mills theory for closed two-dimensional manifolds.
