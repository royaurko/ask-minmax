An extension of the classical action principle obtained in the framework of
the gauge transformations, is used to describe the motion of a particle. This
extension assigns many, but not all, paths to a particle. Properties of the
particle paths are shown to impart wave like behaviour to a particle in motion
and to imply various other assumptions and conjectures attributed to the
formalism of Quantum Mechanics. The Klein-Gordon and other similar equations
are derived by incorporating these properties in the path-integral formalism.
