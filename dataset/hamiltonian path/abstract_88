Three magnetic relativistic Schr\"odinger operators corresponding to the
classical relativistic Hamiltonian symbol with magnetic vector and electric
scalar potentials are considered, dependent on how to quantize the kinetic
energy term $\sqrt{(\xi-A(x))^2 +m^2}$. We discuss their difference in general
and their coincidence in the case of constant magnetic fields, and also study
whether they are covariant under gauge transformation. Then results are
reviewed on path integral representations for their respective imaginary-time
relativistic Schr\"odinger equations, i.e. heat equations, by means of the
probability path space measure related to the L\'evy process concerned.
