We try a conceptual analysis of inheritance diagrams, first in abstract
terms, and then compare to "normality" and the "small/big sets" of preferential
and related reasoning. The main ideas are about nodes as truth values and
information sources, truth comparison by paths, accessibility or relevance of
information by paths, relative normality, and prototypical reasoning.
