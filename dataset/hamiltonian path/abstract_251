We reconsider the Abelian pure Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions by
using our improved Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin Hamiltonian formalism. As a result,
we show several novel features, including the connection of the Dirac brackets.
In particular, through the path integral quantization, we obtain the desired
new type of the Wess-Zumino action.
