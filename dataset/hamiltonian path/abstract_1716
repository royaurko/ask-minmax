Choose two points in the tangent bundle of the Euclidean plane
$(x,X),(y,Y)\in T{R}^2$. In this work we characterise the immersed length
minimising paths with a prescribed bound on the curvature starting at $x$,
tangent to $X$; finishing at $y$, tangent to $Y$, in each connected component
of the space of paths with a prescribed bound on the curvature from $(x,X)$ to
$(y,Y)$.
