In this article we present a Lagrangian representation for evolutionary
systems with a Hamiltonian structure determined by a differential-geometric
Poisson bracket of the first order associated with metrics of constant
curvature. Kaup-Boussinesq system has three local Hamiltonian structures and
one nonlocal Hamiltonian structure associated with metric of constant
curvature. Darboux theorem (reducing Hamiltonian structures to canonical form
''d/dx'' by differential substitutions and reciprocal transformations) for
these Hamiltonian structures is proved.
