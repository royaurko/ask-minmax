We present a new approach to path planning, called the "Ariadne's clew
algorithm". It is designed to find paths in high-dimensional continuous spaces
and applies to robots with many degrees of freedom in static, as well as
dynamic environments - ones where obstacles may move. The Ariadne's clew
algorithm comprises two sub-algorithms, called Search and Explore, applied in
an interleaved manner. Explore builds a representation of the accessible space
while Search looks for the target. Both are posed as optimization problems. We
describe a real implementation of the algorithm to plan paths for a six degrees
of freedom arm in a dynamic environment where another six degrees of freedom
arm is used as a moving obstacle. Experimental results show that a path is
found in about one second without any pre-processing.
