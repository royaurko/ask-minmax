We construct a moduli space of four colorings on planar cubic graphs. More
precisely, we introduce the notion of weak Hamiltonian, a generalization of
Hamiltonian cycles, and relate it to 4-colorings. Weak Hamiltonians have a form
of deformation, which we call mutation, which gives them a graph structure, the
Weak Hamiltonian graph. This graph encodes the different colorings as 3 vertex
cliques. Identifying vertices on these cliques, we obtain a new graph, the
chromatic graph, whose vertices are exactly the colorings of the original
graph. Also, this construction gives a heuristic argument on why 4 colors are
sufficient to color planar maps.
