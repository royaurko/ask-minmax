We develop a resonance theory to describe the evolution of open systems with
time-dependent dynamics. Our approach is based on piecewise constant
Hamiltonians: we represent the evolution on each constant bit using a recently
developed dynamical resonance theory, and we piece them together to obtain the
total evolution. The initial state corresponding to one time-interval with
constant Hamiltonian is the final state of the system corresponding to the
interval before. This results in a non-markovian dynamics. We find a
representation of the dynamics in terms of resonance energies and resonance
states associated to the Hamiltonians, valid for all times $t\geq 0$ and for
small (but fixed) interaction strengths. The representation has the form of a
path integral over resonances. We present applications to a spin-fermion
system, where the energy levels of the spin may undergo rather arbitrary
crossings in the course of time. In particular, we find the probability for
transition between ground- and excited state at all times.
