Classical field theory is considered as a theory of unparametrized surfaces
embedded in a configuration space, which accommodates, in a symmetric way,
spacetime positions and field values. Dynamics is defined by a (Hamiltonian)
constraint between multivector-valued generalized momenta, and points in the
configuration space. Starting from a variational principle, we derive local
equations of motion, that is, differential equations that determine classical
surfaces and momenta. A local Hamilton-Jacobi equation applicable in the field
theory then follows readily. The general method is illustrated with three
examples: non-relativistic Hamiltonian mechanics, De Donder-Weyl scalar field
theory, and string theory.
  Throughout, we use the mathematical formalism of geometric algebra and
geometric calculus, which allows to perform completely coordinate-free
manipulations.
