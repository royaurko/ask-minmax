In [8, 9] M. G. Corrales Garcia, D. M. Barquero, C. Martin Gonzalez, M. Siles
Molina, J. F Solanilla Hernandez described the center of a Leavitt path algebra
and characterized it in terms of the underlying graph. We offer a different
characterization of the center. In particular, we prove that the Boolean
algebra of central idempotents \ of a Leavitt path algebra of a finite graph is
isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of finitary annihilator hereditary subsets of
the graph.
