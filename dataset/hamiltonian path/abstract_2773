The lattice Coulomb-gauge hamiltonian is derived from the transfer matrix of
Wilson's Euclidean lattice gauge theory, wherein the lattice form of Gauss's
law is satisfied identically. The restriction to a fundamental modular region
(no Gribov copies) is implemented in an effective hamiltonian by the addition
of a "horizon function" $G$ to the lattice Coulomb-gauge hamiltonian. Its
coefficient $\gamma_0$ is a thermodynamic parameter that ultimately sets the
scale for hadronic mass, and which is related to the bare coupling constant
$g_0$ by a "horizon condition". This condition determines the low-momentum
behavior of the (ghost) propagator that transmits the instantaneous
longitudinal color-electric field, and thereby provides for a confinement-like
feature in leading order in a new weak-coupling expansion.
