We investigate path integral formalism for continuum theory. It is shown that
the path integral for the soft modes can be represented in the form of a
lattice theory. Kinetic term of this lattice theory has a standard form and
potential term has additional nonlocal terms which contributions should tend to
zero in the limit of continuum theory. Contributions of these terms can be
estimated. It is noted that this representation of path integral may be useful
to improve lattice calculations taking into account hard modes contribution by
standard perturbative expansion. We discuss translation invariance of
correlators and the possibility to construct a lattice theory which keeps
rotary invariance also.
