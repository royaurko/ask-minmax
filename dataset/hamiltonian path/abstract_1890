Using Standard Euclidean Monte Carlo techniques, we discuss in detail the
extraction of the glueball masses of 4-dimensional SU(3) lattice gauge theory
in the Hamiltonian limit, where the temporal lattice spacing is zero. By taking
into account the renormalization of both the anisotropy and the Euclidean
coupling, we calculate the string tension and masses of the scalar, axial
vector and tensor states using standard Wilson action on increasingly
anisotropic lattices, and make an extrapolation to the Hamiltonian limit. The
results are compared with estimates from various other Hamiltonian and
Euclidean studies. We find that more accurate determination of the glueball
masses and the mass ratios has been achieved and the results are a significant
improvement upon previous Hamiltonian estimates. The continuum predictions are
then found by extrapolation of results obtained from smallest values of spatial
lattice spacing. For the lightest scalar, tensor and axial vector states we
obtain masses of $m_{0^{++}}=1654 \pm 83$ MeV, $m_{2^{++}}=2272\pm 115$ MeV and
$m_{1^{+-}}=2940\pm 165$ MeV, respectively. These are consistent with the
estimates obtained in the previous studies in the Euclidean limit. The
consistency is a clear evidence of universality between Euclidean and
Hamiltonian formulations. From the accuracy of our estimates, we conclude that
the standard Euclidean Monte Carlo method is a reliable technique for obtaining
results in the Hamiltonian version of the theory, just as in Euclidean case.
