We calculate the subleading terms in the Born--Oppenheimer expansion for the
effective zero-mode Hamiltonian of N = 1, d=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory
with any gauge group. The Hamiltonian depends on 3r abelian gauge potentials
A_i, lying in the Cartan subalgebra, and their superpartners (r being the rank
of the group). The Hamiltonian belongs to the class of N = 2 supersymmetric QM
Hamiltonia constructed earlier by Ivanov and I. Its bosonic part describes the
motion over the 3r--dimensional manifold with a special metric. The corrections
explode when the root forms \alpha_j(A_i) vanish and the Born--Oppenheimer
approximation breaks down.
