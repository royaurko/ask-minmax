Two dimensional classical integrable systems and different integrable
deformations for them are derived from phase space realizations of classical
$sl(2)$ Poisson coalgebras and their $q-$deformed analogues. Generalizations of
Morse, oscillator and centrifugal potentials are obtained. The N=2 Calogero
system is shown to be $sl(2)$ coalgebra invariant and the well-known
Jordan-Schwinger realization can be also derived from a (non-coassociative)
coproduct on $sl(2)$. The Gaudin Hamiltonian associated to such
Jordan-Schwinger construction is presented. Through these examples, it can be
clearly appreciated how the coalgebra symmetry of a hamiltonian system allows a
straightforward construction of different integrable deformations for it.
