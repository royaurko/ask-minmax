These notes are based on lectures held at the Lanzhou university (China)
during a CIMPA summer school in july 2004 but benefit from recent
devellopements. Our aim is to explain some perturbations technics that allow to
study the long time behaviour of the solutions of Hamiltonian perturbations of
integrable systems. We are in particular interested with stability results. Our
approach is centered on the Birkhoff normal form theorem that we first proved
in finite dimension. Then, after giving some exemples of Hamiltonian PDEs, we
present an abstract Birkhoff normal form theorem in infinite dimension and
discuss the dynamical consequences for Hamiltonian PDEs.
