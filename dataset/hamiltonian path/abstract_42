We have studied the path integral solution of a system of particle moving in
certain class of non-central potential without using Kustannheimo-Stiefel
transformation. The Hamiltonian of the system has been converted to a separable
Hamiltonian of Liouville type in parabolic coordinates and has further reduced
to a Hamiltonian corresponding to two 2- dimensional simple harmonic
oscillators. The energy spectrum for this system is calculated analytically.
Hartmann ring-shaped potential and compound Coulomb plus Aharanov- Bohm
potential have also been studied as special cases.
