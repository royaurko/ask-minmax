In this research we describe effective Hamiltonian theory and apply this
theory to the calculation of current-current $Q_{12}$ and QCD penguin
$Q_{3...6}$ decay rates We calculate the decay rates of semileptonic and
hadronic of charm quark in effective Hamiltonian theory. We investigate the
decay rates of D meson decays according to Spectator Quark Model(SQM) for the
calculation of D meson decays. We obtain the total decay rates of semileptonic
and hadronic of charm quark in effective Hamiltonian according to colour
Favoured (C-F) and colour Suppressed (C-S), and then to added amplitude of
processes colour Favoured and colour Suppressed (F-S) and obtain the decay
rates of them.
