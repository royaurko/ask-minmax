A general spin symmetry argument is proposed for spin currents in
semiconductors. In particular, due to the symmetry with respect to spin
polarization of the helicity eigenstates of the Luttinger Hamiltonian for a
hole-doped semiconductor, the spin polarized flux from a single helicity
eigenstate induced by an external electric field, is canceled exactly when all
such contributions from eigenstates that are degenerate in energy are summed.
Thus, the net spin current predicted by Murakami et al, Science 301, 1348
(2003), cannot be produced by such a Hamiltonian. Possible symmetry breaking
mechanisms which may generate a spin current are discussed.
