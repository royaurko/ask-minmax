Neutrino mean free paths in magnetized neutron matter are calculated using
the Hartree-Fock approximation with effective Skyrme and Gogny forces in the
framework of the Landau Fermi Liquid Theory. It is shown that describing
nuclear interaction with Skyrme forces and for magnetic field strengths
$log_{10} B(G) \gtrsim 17$, the neutrino mean free paths stay almost unchanged
at intermediate densities but they largely increase at high densities when they
are compared to the field-free case results. However the description with Gogny
forces differs from the previous and mean free paths stay almonst unchanged or
decrease at densities $[1-2]\rho_0$. This different behaviour can be explained
due to the combination of common mild variation of the Landau parameters with
both types of forces and the values of the nucleon effective mass and induced
magnetization of matter under presence of a strong magnetic field as described
with the two parametrizations of the nuclear interaction.
