We study bi-Hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type with non-singular
(semisimple) non-local bi-Hamiltonian structures and prove that such systems of
hydrodynamic type are diagonalizable. Moreover, we prove that for an arbitrary
non-singular (semisimple) non-locally bi-Hamiltonian system of hydrodynamic
type, there exist local coordinates (Riemann invariants) such that all the
related matrix differential-geometric objects, namely, the matrix V^i_j(u) of
this system of hydrodynamic type, the metrics g^{ij}_1(u) and g^{ij}_2(u) and
the affinors (w_{1, n})^i_j(u) and (w_{2,n})^i_j(u) of the non-singular
non-local bi-Hamiltonian structure of this system, are diagonal in these local
coordinates. The proof is a natural consequence of the general results of the
theory of compatible metrics and the theory of non-local bi-Hamiltonian
structures developed earlier by the present contributor.
