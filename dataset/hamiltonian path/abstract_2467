The present paper makes a connection between collective bosonic states and
the exact solutions of the $p_x + ip_y$ pairing Hamiltonian. This makes it
possible to investigate the effects of the Pauli principle on the energy
spectrum, by gradually reintroducing the Pauli principle. It also introduces an
efficient and stable numerical method to probe all the eigenstates of this
class of Hamiltonians.
