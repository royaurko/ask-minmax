Let X and Y be independent transient Markov chains on the same state space
that have the same transition probabilities. Let L denote the ``loop-erased
path'' obtained from the path of X by erasing cycles when they are created. We
prove that if the paths of X and Y have infinitely many intersections a.s.,
then L and Y also have infinitely many intersections a.s.
