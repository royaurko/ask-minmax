On the example of the quantized spinor field, interacting with arbitrary
external electromagnetic field, the commutation function is studied. It is
shown that a proper time representation is available in any dimensions. Using
it, all the light cone singularities of the function are found explicitly,
generalizing the Fock formula in four dimensions, and a path integral
representation is constructed.
