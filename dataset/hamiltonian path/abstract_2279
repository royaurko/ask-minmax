We consider an invariant skew-symmetric phase-space metric for
non-Hamiltonian systems. We say that the metric is an invariant if the metric
tensor field is an integral of motion. We derive the time-dependent
skew-symmetric phase-space metric that satisfies the Jacobi identity. The
example of non-Hamiltonian systems with linear friction term is considered.
