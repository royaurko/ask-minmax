Manufacturing of free form parts relies on the calculation of a tool path
based on a CAD model, on a machining strategy and on a given numerically
controlled machine tool. In order to reach the best possible performances, it
is necessary to take into account a maximum of constraints during tool path
calculation. For this purpose, we have developed a surface representation of
the tool paths to manage 5-axis High Speed Milling, which is the most
complicated case. This model allows integrating early in the step of tool path
computation the machine tool geometrical constraints (axis ranges, part holder
orientation), kinematical constraints (speed and acceleration on the axes,
singularities) as well as gouging issues between the tool and the part. The aim
of the paper is to optimize the step of 5-axis HSM tool path calculation with a
bi-parameter surface representation of the tool path. We propose an example of
integration of the digital process for tool path computation, ensuring the
required quality and maximum productivity
