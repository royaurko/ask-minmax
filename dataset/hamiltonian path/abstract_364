We study the tunneling dynamics of dopant-induced hole polarons which are
self-localized by electron-phonon coupling in a two-dimensional antiferro-
magnet. Our treatment is based on a path integral formulation of the adia-
batic approximation, combined with many-body tight-binding, instanton, con-
strained lattice dynamics, and many-body exact diagonalization techniques. Our
results are mainly based on the Holstein-$tJ$ and, for comparison, on the
Holstein-Hubbard model. We also study effects of 2nd neighbor hopping and
long-range electron-electron Coulomb repulsion. The polaron tunneling dynamics
is mapped onto an effective low-energy Hamiltonian which takes the form of a
fermion tight-binding model with occupancy dependent, predominant- ly 2nd and
3rd neighbor tunneling matrix elements, excluded double occupan- cy, and an
effective intersite charge interactions. Antiferromagnetic spin correlations in
the original many-electron Hamiltonian are reflected by an attractive
contribution to the 1st neighbor charge interaction and by Berry phase factors
which determine the signs of effective polaron tunneling ma- trix elements. In
the two-polaron case, these phase factors lead to polaron pair wave functions
of either $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry or p-wave symme- try with zero and
nonzero total pair momentum, respectively. Implications for the doping
dependent isotope effect, pseudo-gap and Tc of a superconduc- ting polaron pair
condensate are discussed/compared to observed in cuprates.
