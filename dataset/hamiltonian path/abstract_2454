A new Hamiltonian formulation of the minisuperspace cosmology following from
the geodetic brane gravity model introduced by Regge and Teitelboim is
presented. The model is considered in the framework of higher derivative
theories which facilitates Hamiltonian formulation. The analysis is done using
the equivalent first order approach. The constraint algebra is shown to realize
a truncated Virasoro algebra. The gauge generator containing the exact number
of gauge parameters is constructed. Equivalence between the gauge and
reparametrization symmetries has been demonstrated. Complete gauge fixed
computations have been provided and formal quantization is indicated.
