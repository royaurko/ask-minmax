We consider Gevrey perturbations $H$ of a completely integrable Gevrey
Hamiltonian $H_0$. Given a Cantor set $\Omega_\kappa$ defined by a Diophantine
condition, we find a family of KAM invariant tori of $H$ with frequencies
$\omega\in \Omega_\kappa$ which is Gevrey smooth in a Whitney sense. Moreover,
we obtain a symplectic Gevrey normal form of the Hamiltonian in a neighborhood
of the union $\Lambda$ of the invariant tori. This leads to effective stability
of the quasiperiodic motion near $\Lambda$.
