The equivalence of two complete sets of Poisson commuting Hamiltonians of the
(super)integrable rational BC(n) Ruijsenaars-Schneider-van Diejen system is
established. Specifically, the commuting Hamiltonians constructed by van Diejen
are shown to be linear combinations of the Hamiltonians generated by the
characteristic polynomial of the Lax matrix obtained recently by Pusztai, and
the explicit formula of this invertible linear transformation is found.
