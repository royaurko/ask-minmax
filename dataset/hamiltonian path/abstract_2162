The dynamics of spinning particles in curved space-time is discussed,
emphasizing the hamiltonian formulation. Different choices of hamiltonians
allow for the description of different gravitating systems. We give full
results for the simplest case with minimal hamiltonian, constructing constants
of motion including spin. The analysis is illustrated by the example of motion
in Schwarzschild space-time. We also discuss a non-minimal extension of the
hamiltonian giving rise to a gravitational equivalent of the Stern-Gerlach
force. We show that this extension respects a large class of known constants of
motion for the minimal case.
