We consider the coaction of two distinct noise sources on the activation
process of a single or two interacting excitable units represented by the
Fitzhugh-Nagumo model. The nonlocal approach involving Hamiltonian formalism is
adapted to obtain the most probable activation paths around which the
corresponding stochastic trajectories are clustered. The key point lies in
introducing the boundary conditions relevant for a class II excitable unit,
which further allow an immediate generalization to scenarios involving a couple
of units. We also analyze the effects of two noise sources on the statistical
features of the activation process, demonstrating how these are modified due to
the linear/nonlinear form of interactions. Universal properties of activation
process are qualitatively discussed in light of stochastic bifurcation,
underlying transition from stochastically stable fixed point to continuous
oscillations.
