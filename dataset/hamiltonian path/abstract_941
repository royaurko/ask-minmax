We define a characteristic function for probability measures on the
signatures of geometric rough paths. We apply our results to determine
uniqueness of random variables based on their expected signature, and prove a
method of moments for weak convergence of random variables. We furthermore
study analyticity properties of the characteristic function and describe a
class of geometric rough paths, containing families of Gaussian and Markovian
rough paths, for which the expected signature uniquely identifies each random
variable within the class.
