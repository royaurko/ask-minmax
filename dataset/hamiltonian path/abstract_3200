Evolution of the shell structure of nuclei near the neutron drip line is
investigated in the Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) theory. By
introducing the vector self-coupling of $\omega$ meson in the RHB theory, we
reproduce successfully the experimental data on the shell effects about the
waiting-point nucleus $^{80}$Zn. With this basis, it is shown that the shell
effects at N=82 in the inaccessible region of the r-process path remain strong.
In contrast, a quenching exhibited by the HFB+SkP approach is shown to be
incompatible with the available data. Consequently, the neutrino-driven
mechanism of the nucleosynthesis is supported.
