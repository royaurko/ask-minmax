We show that the quotient associated to a quasi-Hamiltonian space has a
symplectic structure even when 1 is not a regular value of the momentum map: it
is a disjoint union of symplectic manifolds of possibly different dimensions,
which generalizes a result of Alekseev, Malkin and Meinrenken. We illustrate
this theorem with the example of representation spaces of surface groups. As an
intermediary step, we show that the isotropy submanifolds of a
quasi-Hamiltonian space are quasi-Hamiltonian spaces themselves.
