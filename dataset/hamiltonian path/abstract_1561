We study the elastic properties of a single A/B copolymer chain with a
specific sequence. We predict a rich structure in the force extension relations
which can be addressed to the sequence. The variational method is introduced to
probe local minima on the path of stretching and releasing. At given force, we
find multiple configurations which are separated by energy barriers. A
collapsed globular configuration consists of several domains which unravel
cooperatively. Upon stretching, unfolding path shows stepwise pattern
corresponding to the unfolding of each domain. While releasing, several cores
can be created simultaneously in the middle of the chain resulting in a
different path of collapse.
