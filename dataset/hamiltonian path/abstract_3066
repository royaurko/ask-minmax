The role of self-heating and hot-phonons on electronic transport in metallic
single walled carbon nanotube is examined by solving a coupled electron-optical
phonon (OP) Boltzmann transport equation and the classical heat equation. We
find that self-heating reduces the high bias conductance, thus explaining the
short OP mean free paths observed experimentally, while the non-equilibrium OP
population reduces the overall current level. Comparison with experimental data
shows that for tubes on a substrate, no significant population of hot phonons
builds up under the normal range of applied bias. These results shed light on
OP phonon decay paths in carbon nanotubes.
