Compact U(1) lattice gauge theory in (2+1) dimensions is studied on
anisotropic lattices using Standard Path Integral Monte Carlo techniques. We
extract the static quark potential and the string tension from 1.0 <= Dtau <=
0.333 simulations at 1.0 <= beta <= 3.0. Estimating the actual value of the
renormalization constant, (c = 44), we observe the evidence of scaling in the
string tension for 1.4142 <= beta <= 2.5; with the asymptotic behaviour in the
large-beta limit given by K sqrt(beta) = e^(-2.494 beta +2.29). Extrapolations
are made to the extreme anisotropic or "Hamiltonian" limit, and comparisons are
made with previous estimates obtained by various other methods in the
Hamiltonian formulation.
