Recently (see quant-ph/0503040) an explicit example has been given of a
PT-symmetric non-diagonalizable Hamiltonian. In this paper we show that such
Hamiltonians appear as supersymmetric (SUSY) partners of Hermitian (hence
diagonalizable) Hamiltonians and they can be turned back to diagonalizable
forms by appropriate SUSY transformations.
