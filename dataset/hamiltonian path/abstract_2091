Quark-nuclear matter (QNM) is a many-body system containing hadrons and
deconfined quarks. Starting from a microscopic quark-meson coupling (QMC)
Hamiltonian with a density dependent quark-quark interaction, an effective
quark-hadron Hamiltonian is constructed via a mapping procedure. The mapping is
implemented with a unitary operator such that composites are redescribed by
elementary-particle field operators that satisfy canonical commutation
relations in an extended Fock space. Application of the unitary operator to the
microscopic Hamiltonian leads to effective, hermitian operators that have a
clear physical interpretation. At sufficiently high densities, the effective
Hamiltonian contains interactions that lead to quark deconfinement. The
equation of state of QNM is obtained using standard many-body techniques with
the effective quark-hadron Hamiltonian. At low densities, the model is
equivalent to a QMC model with confined quarks. Beyond a critical density, when
quarks start to deconfine, the equation of state predicted for QNM is softer
than the QMC equation of state with confined quarks.
