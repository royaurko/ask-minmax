We prove the existence of a Lie algebra of first integrals for time dependent
Hamiltonian systems of Lie type. Moreover, applying the Floquet theory for
periodic Euler systems on Lie algebras, we show the existence of an abelian Lie
algebra of periodic first integrals for periodic Hamiltonian systems. An
application to the dynamics of a nonlinear oscillator is given.
