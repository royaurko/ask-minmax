Time-dependent unitary transformations are used to study the Schreodinger
equation for explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonians of the form $H(t)=\vec
R(t).\vec J$, where $\vec R$ is an arbitrary real vector-valued function of
time and $\vec J$ is the angular momentum operator. The solution of the
Schreodinger equation for the most general Hamiltonian of this form is shown to
be equivalent to the special case $\vec R=(1,0,\nu(t))$. This corresponds to
the problem of driven two-level atom for the spin half representation of $\vec
J$. It is also shown that by requiring the magnitude of $\vec R$ to depend on
its direction in a particular way, one can solve the Schreodinger equation
exactly. In particular, it is shown that for every Hamiltonian of the form
$H(t)=\vec R(t)\cdot \vec J$ there is another Hamiltonian with the same
eigenstates for which the Schreodinger equation is exactly solved. The
application of the results to the exact solution of the parallel transport
equation and exact holonomy calculation for SU(2) principal bundles
(Yang-Mills gauge theory) is also pointed out.
