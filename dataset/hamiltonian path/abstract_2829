We derive a normal form for a near-integrable, four-dimensional symplectic
map with a fold or cusp singularity in its frequency mapping. The normal form
is obtained for when the frequency is near a resonance and the mapping is
approximately given by the time-$T$ mapping of a two-degree-of freedom
Hamiltonian flow. Consequently there is an energy-like invariant. The fold
Hamiltonian is similar to the well-studied, one-degree-of freedom case but is
essentially nonintegrable when the direction of the singular curve in action
does not coincide with curves of the resonance module. We show that many
familiar features, such as multiple island chains and reconnecting invariant
manifolds, are retained even in this case. The cusp Hamiltonian has an
essential coupling between its two degrees of freedom even when the singular
set is aligned with the resonance module. Using averaging, we approximately
reduced this case to one degree of freedom as well. The resulting Hamiltonian
and its perturbation with small cusp-angle is analyzed in detail.
