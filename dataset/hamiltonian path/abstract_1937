By means of the Ito-Nisio theorem, we introduce and discuss a general
approach to series representations of path integrals. We then argue that the
optimal basis for both ``primitive'' and partial averaged approaches is the
Wiener sine-Fourier basis. The present analysis also suggests a new approach to
improving the convergence of primitive path integral methods. Current work
indicates that this new technique, the ``reweighted'' method, converges as the
cube of the number of path variables for ``smooth'' potentials. The technique
is based on a special way of approximating the Brownian bridge which enters the
Feynman-Kac formula and it does not require the Gaussian transform of the
potential for its implementation.
