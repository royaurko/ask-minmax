In the large polaron model of H. Froehlich the electron-phonon interaction is
a small perturbation in form sense, but a large perturbation in operator sense.
This means that the form-domain of the Hamiltonian is not affected by the
interaction but the domain of self-adjointness is. In the particular case of
the Froehlich model we are nevertheless able, thanks to a recently published
new operator bound, to give an explicit characterization of the domain in terms
of a suitable dressing transform. Using the mapping properties of this dressing
transform we analyze the smoothness of vectors in the domain of the Hamiltonian
with respect to the position of the electron.
