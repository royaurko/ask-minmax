The connection between the canonical and the path integral formulations of
Einstein's gravitational field is discussed using the Hamilton - Jacobi method.
Unlike conventional methods, it is shown that our path integral method leads to
obtain the measure of integration with no $\delta$- functions, no need to fix
any gauge and so no ambiguous deteminants will appear.
