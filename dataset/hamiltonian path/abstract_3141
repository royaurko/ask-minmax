There is strong evidence coming from Lorentzian dynamical triangulations that
the unboundedness of the gravitational action is no obstacle to the
construction of a well-defined non-perturbative path integral. In a continuum
approach, a similar suppression of the conformal divergence comes about as the
result of a non-trivial path-integral measure.
