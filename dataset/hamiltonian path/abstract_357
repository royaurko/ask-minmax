Exact spectral truncations of the unforced, inviscid Burgers-Hopf equation
are Hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom which exhibit intrinsic
stochasticity and coherent scaling behavior. For this reason recent studies
have employed these systems as prototypes to test stochastic mode reduction
strategies. In the present paper the Burgers-Hopf dynamics truncated to n
Fourier modes is treated by a new statistical model reduction technique, and a
closed system of evolution equations for the mean values of the m lowest modes
is derived for m << n. In the reduced model the m-mode macrostates are
associated with trial probability densities on the phase space of the n-mode
microstates, and a cost functional is introduced to quantify the lack of fit of
paths of these densities to the Liouville equation. The best-fit macrodynamics
is obtained by minimizing the cost functional over paths, and the equations
governing the closure are then derived from Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The
resulting reduced equations have a fractional diffusion and modified nonlinear
interactions, and the explicit form of both are determined up to a single
closure parameter. The accuracy and range of validity of this nonequilibrium
closure is assessed by comparison against direct numerical simulations of
statistical ensembles, and the predicted behaviour is found to be well
represented by the reduced equations.
