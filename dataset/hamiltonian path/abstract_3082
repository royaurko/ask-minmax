The simplest (3+1)D Regge calculus model (with three-dimensional discrete
space and continuous time) is considered which describes evolution of the
simplest closed two-tetrahedron piecewise flat manifold in the continuous time.
The measure in the path integral which describes canonical quantisation of the
model in terms of area bivectors and connections as independent variables is
found. It is shown that selfdual-antiselfdual splitting of the variables
simplifies the integral although does not admit complete separation of
(anti-)selfdual sector.
