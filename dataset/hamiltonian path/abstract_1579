Transverse momentum dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions
are described by hadronic matrix elements of bilocal products of field
operators off the light-cone. These bilocal products contain gauge-links, as
required by gauge-invariance. The gauge-links are path-ordered exponentials
connecting the field operators along a certain integration path. This
integration path is process-dependent, depending specifically on the
short-distance partonic subprocess. In this paper we present the technical
details needed in the calculation of the gauge-links and a calculational scheme
is provided to obtain the gauge-invariant distribution and fragmentation
correlators corresponding to a given partonic subprocess.
