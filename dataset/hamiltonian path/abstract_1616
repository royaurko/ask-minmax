We argue differences between the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang with Quenched disorder
(KPZQ) and the Ballistic Deposition with Power-law noise (BDP) models, using
the multiaffine analysis method. The KPZQ and the BDP models show mono-affinity
and multiaffinity, respectively. This difference results from the different
distribution types of neighbor-height differences in growth paths. Exponential
and power-law distributions are observed in the KPZQ and the BDP, respectively.
In addition, we point out the difference of profiles directly, i.e., although
the surface profiles of both models and the growth path of the BDP model are
rough, the growth path of the KPZQ model is smooth.
