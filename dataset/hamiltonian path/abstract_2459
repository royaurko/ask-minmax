In many Hamiltonian systems, propagation of steadily travelling solitons or
kinks is prohibited because of resonances with linear excitations. We show that
Hamiltonian systems with resonances may admit an infinite number of travelling
solitons or kinks if the closest to the real axis singularities in the complex
upper half-plane of limiting asymptotic solution are of the form
$z_\pm=\pm\alpha+i\beta$, $\alpha\ne 0$. This quite a general statement is
illustrated by examples of the fifth-order Korteweg--de Vries-type equation,
the discrete cubic-quintic Klein--Gordon equation, and the nonlocal double
sine--Gordon equations.
