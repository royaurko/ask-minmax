An adaptive, kink-based path integral formalism is used to calculate the
ground state energies of the atoms He-Ne. The method uses an adaptive scheme to
virtually eliminate the sign difficulties. This is done by using a Monte Carlo
scheme to identify states that contribute significantly to the canonical
partition function and then include them in the wavefunctions to calculate the
canonical averages. The calculations use the 6-31G basis set and obtain both
precision and accuracy.
