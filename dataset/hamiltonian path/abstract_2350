We propose a generalization of hamiltonian mechanics, as a hamiltonian
inclusion with convex dissipation function. We obtain a dynamical version of
the approach of Mielke to quasistatic rate-independent processes. Then we show
that a class of models of dynamical brittle damage can be formulated in this
setting.
