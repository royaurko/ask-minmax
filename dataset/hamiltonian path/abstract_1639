We theoretically study the inelastic scattering rate and the carrier mean
free path for energetic hot electrons in graphene, including both
electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. Taking account of optical
phonon emission and electron-electron scattering, we find that the inelastic
scattering time $\tau \sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1} \mathrm{ps}$ and the mean free path
$l \sim 10-10^2 \mathrm{nm}$ for electron densities $n = 10^{12}-10^{13}
\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. In particular, we find that the mean free path exhibits a
finite jump at the phonon energy $200 \mathrm{meV}$ due to electron-phonon
interaction. Our results are directly applicable to device structures where
ballistic transport is relevant with inelastic scattering dominating over
elastic scattering.
