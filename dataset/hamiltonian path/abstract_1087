A navigational query on a graph database returns binary relations over the
nodes of the graph. Recently, regular expression-based path query languages are
popular in expressing navigational queries on RDF graphs. It is natural to
replace regular expressions by context-free grammar so that the power of
current regular expression-based path query languages would be increased since
regular expressions are strictly subsumed in context-free grammar. In this
paper, we present context-free path queries and context-free SPARQL queries on
RDF graphs and investigate some of their fundamental properties. Our results
show that those proposed context-free path queries have efficient query
evaluation and context-free SPARQL queries have the same complexity of query
evaluation as SPARQL queries. Regarding expressiveness, we prove that those
context-free path queries exactly subsume corresponding fragments of nested
regular expressions and context-free SPARQL is a strict extension of both
SPARQL and nSPARQL.
