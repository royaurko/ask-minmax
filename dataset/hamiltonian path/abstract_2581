We prove short-time existence of smooth solutions for a class of nonlinear,
and in general spatially nonlocal, Hamiltonian evolution equations that
describe the self-interaction of weakly nonlinear scale-invariant waves. These
equations include ones that describe weakly nonlinear hyperbolic surface waves,
such as nonlinear Rayleigh waves
