A simple and general implementation of Hamiltonian replica exchange for the
popular molecular-dynamics software GROMACS is presented. In this
implementation, arbitrarily different Hamiltonians can be used for the
different replicas without incurring in any significant performance penalty.
The implementation was validated on a simple toy model - alanine dipeptide in
water - and applied to study the rearrangement of an RNA tetraloop, where it
was used to compare recently proposed force-field corrections.
