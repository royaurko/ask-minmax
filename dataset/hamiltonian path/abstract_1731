We introduce the following notion: a digraph $D=(V,A)$ with arc weights $c:
A\rightarrow \R$ is called nearly conservative if every negative cycle consists
of two arcs. Computing shortest paths in nearly conservative digraphs is
NP-hard, and even deciding whether a digraph is nearly conservative is
coNP-complete.
  We show that the "All Pairs Shortest Path" problem is fixed parameter
tractable with various parameters for nearly conservative digraphs. The results
also apply for the special case of conservative mixed graphs.
