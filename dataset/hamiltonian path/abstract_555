In this paper, we investigate the Martin boundary of a graded graph
$\mathcal{Z}$ whose paths represent coherent sequences of permutations. This
graph was introduced by Viennot and its boundary studied by Gnedin and
Olshanski. We prove that the Martin boundary of this graph coincides with its
minimal boundary. Then we relate paths on this graph with paths on the Young
graph, and finally give a central limit theorem for the Plancherel measure on
the paths of $\mathcal{Z}$.
