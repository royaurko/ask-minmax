We determine the entanglement capability of self-inverse Hamiltonian
evolution, which reduces to the known result for Ising Hamiltonian, and
identify optimal input states for yielding the maximal entanglement rate. We
introduce the concept of the operator entanglement rate, and find that the
maximal operator entanglement rate gives a lower bound on the entanglement
capability of a general Hamiltonian.
