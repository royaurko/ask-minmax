In this paper we develop a straightforward procedure to construct higher
dimensional isochronous Hamiltonian systems. We first show that a class of
singular Hamiltonian systems obtained through the $\Omega$-modified procedure
is equivalent to constrained Newtonian systems. Even though such systems admit
isochronous oscillations, they are effectively one degree of freedom systems
due to the constraints. Then we generalize the procedure in terms of
$\Omega_i$-modified Hamiltonians and identify suitable canonically conjugate
coordinates such that the constructed $\Omega_i$-modified Hamiltonian is
\emph{nonsingular} and the corresponding Newton's equation of motion is
constraint free. The procedure is first illustrated for two dimensional systems
and subsequently extended to $N$-dimensional systems. The general solution of
these systems are obtained by integrating the underlying equations and is shown
to admit isochronous as well as amplitude independent quasiperiodic solutions
depending on the choice of parameters.
