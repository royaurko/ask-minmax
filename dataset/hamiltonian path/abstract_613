Recently, it has been shown that Absolute Parallelism (AP) geometry admits
paths that are naturally quantized. These paths have been used to describe the
motion of spinning particles in a background gravitational field. In case of a
weak static gravitational field limits, the paths are applied successfully to
interpret the discrepancy in the motion of thermal neutrons in the Earth's
gravitational field (COW-experiment). The aim of the present work is to explore
the properties of the deviation equations corresponding to these paths. In the
present work the deviation equations are derived and compared to the geodesic
deviation equation of the Riemannian geometry.
