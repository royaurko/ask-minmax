The constraint reaction force of ideal nonholonomic constraints in
time-dependent mechanics on a configuration bundle $Q\to R$ is obtained. Using
the vertical extension of Hamiltonian formalism to the vertical tangent bundle
$VQ$ of $Q\to R$, the Hamiltonian of a nonholonomic constrained system is
constructed.
