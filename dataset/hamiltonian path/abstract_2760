The equation of state of Hamiltonian lattice QCD at finite density is
examined in the strong coupling limit by constructing a solution to the
equation of motion corresponding to an effective Hamiltonian describing the
ground state of the many body system. This solution exactly diagonalizes the
Hamiltonian to second order in field operators for all densities and is used to
evaluate the vacuum energy density from which we obtain the equation of state.
We find that up to and beyond the chiral symmetry restoration density the
pressure of the quark Fermi sea can be negative indicating its mechanical
instability. Our result is in qualitative agreement with continuum models and
should be verifiable by future lattice simulations of strongly coupled QCD at
finite density.
