We study the number of hamiltonian circuits, containing a fixed basis, and
the number of hyperplanes, which do not contain a fixed basis in perfect
matroid designs. Projective and affine finite geometries are considered as
examples of such matroids. We give algorithms to find the hyperplanes and the
hamiltonian circuits in such cases.
