Inspired by the recent results of C. Landim, G. Panizo and H.-T. Yau [LPY] on
spectral gap and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for unbounded conservative
spin systems, we study uniform bounds in these inequalities for Glauber
dynamics of Hamiltonian of the form V(x_1) + ... + V(x_n) + V(M-x_1 -...-x_n),
(x_1,...,x_n) in R^n Specifically, we examine the case V is strictly convex (or
small perturbation of strictly convex) and, following [LPY], the case V is a
bounded perturbation of a quadratic potential. By a simple path counting
argument for the standard random walk, uniform bounds for the Glauber dynamics
yields, in a transparent way, the classical L^{-2} decay for the Kawasaki
dynamics on d-dimensional cubes of length L. The arguments of proofs however
closely follow and make heavy use of the conservative approach and estimates of
[LPY], relying in particular on the Lu-Yau martingale decomposition and clever
partitionings of the conditional measure.
