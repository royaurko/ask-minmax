A program called SCSPG (Semi-Circle Segmented Path Generator) is presented in
this report. How it works is described and an example of it is illustrated
using a case of work of friction along a curved path. As a benchmark for the
program, work of friction along straight path is calculated and then compared
to theoretical prediction.
