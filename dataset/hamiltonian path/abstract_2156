Let $D$ be a strongly connected directed graph of order $n\geq 4$ vertices
which satisfies the following condition for every triple $x,y,z$ of vertices
such that $x$ and $y$ are non-adjacent: If there is no arc from $x$ to $z$,
then $d(x)+d(y)+d^+(x)+d^-(z)\geq 3n-2$. If there is no arc from $z$ to $x$,
then $d(x)+d(y)+d^-(x)+d^+(z)\geq 3n-2$. In \cite{[15]} (J. of Graph Theory,
Vol.16, No. 5, 51-59, 1992) Y. Manoussakis proved that $D$ is Hamiltonian. In
[9] it was shown that $D$ contains a pre-Hamiltonian cycle (i.e., a cycle of
length $n-1$) or $n$ is even and $D$ is isomorphic to the complete bipartite
digraph with partite sets of cardinalities of $n/2$ and $n/2$. In this paper we
show that $D$ contains also a Hamiltonian bypass, (i.e., a subdigraph obtained
from a Hamiltonian cycle by reversing exactly one arc) or $D$ is isomorphic to
one tournament of order 5.
