Lyons' Rough Path theory is currently formulated in p-variation topology. We
extend his main-result, the Universal Limit Theorem, to a stronger Hoelder
topology. Several approximations to Brownian Rough Paths are studied. As
application of our approach, we obtain the celebrated support theorem (in
Hoelder-topology) as immediate (!) corollary.
