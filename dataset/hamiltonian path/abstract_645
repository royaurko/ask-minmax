A weighted coloured-edge graph is a graph for which each edge is assigned
both a positive weight and a discrete colour, and can be used to model
transportation and computer networks in which there are multiple transportation
modes. In such a graph paths are compared by their total weight in each colour,
resulting in a Pareto set of minimal paths from one vertex to another. This
paper will give a tight upper bound on the cardinality of a minimal set of
paths for any weighted coloured-edge graph. Additionally, a bound is presented
on the expected number of minimal paths in weighted bicoloured-edge graphs.
