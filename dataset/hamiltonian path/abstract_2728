Symplectic integration algorithms are well-suited for long-term integrations
of Hamiltonian systems because they preserve the geometric structure of the
Hamiltonian flow. However, this desirable property is generally lost when
adaptive timestep control is added to a symplectic integrator. We describe an
adaptive-timestep symplectic integrator that can be used if the Hamiltonian is
the sum of kinetic and potential energy components and the required timestep
depends only on the potential energy (e.g. test-particle integrations in fixed
potentials). In particular, we describe an explicit, reversible, symplectic,
leapfrog integrator for a test particle in a near-Keplerian potential; this
integrator has timestep proportional to distance from the attracting mass and
has the remarkable property of integrating orbits in an inverse-square force
field with only "along-track" errors; i.e. the phase-space shape of a Keplerian
orbit is reproduced exactly, but the orbital period is in error by O(1/N^2),
where N is the number of steps per period.
