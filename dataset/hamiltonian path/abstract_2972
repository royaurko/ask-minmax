We investigate the use of a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to map out the posterior
density function for supermassive black hole binaries. While previous Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, such as Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, have been
successfully employed for a number of different gravitational wave sources,
these methods are essentially random walk algorithms. The Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo treats the inverse likelihood surface as a "gravitational potential" and
by introducing canonical positions and momenta, dynamically evolves the Markov
chain by solving Hamilton's equations of motion. We present an implementation
of the Hamiltonian Markov Chain that is faster, and more efficient by a factor
of approximately the dimension of the parameter space, than the standard MCMC.
