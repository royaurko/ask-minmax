Large amplitude collective motion is investigated for a model pairing
Hamiltonian containing an avoided level crossing. A classical theory of
collective motion for the adiabatic limit is applied utilising either a
time-dependent mean-field theory or a direct parametrisation of the
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. A modified local harmonic equation is
formulated to take account of the Nambu-Goldstone mode. It turns out that in
some cases the system selects a diabatic path. Requantizing the collective
Hamiltonian, a reasonable agreement with an exact calculation for the low-lying
levels are obtained for both weak and strong pairing force. This improves on
results of the conventional Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
