Ants are known to be able to find paths of minimal length between the nest
and food sources. The deposit of pheromones while they search for food and
their chemotactical response to them has been proposed as a crucial element in
the mechanism for finding minimal paths. We investigate both individual and
collective behavior of ants in some simple networks representing basic mazes.
The character of the graphs considered is such that it allows a fully rigorous
mathematical treatment via analysis of some markovian processes in terms of
which the evolution can be represented. Our analytical and computational
results show that in order for the ants to follow shortest paths between nest
and food, it is necessary to superimpose to the ants' random walk the
chemotactic reinforcement. It is also needed a certain degree of persistence so
that ants tend to move preferably without changing their direction much. It is
also important the number of ants, since we will show that the speed for
finding minimal paths increases very fast with it.
