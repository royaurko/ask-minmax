I investigate the relationship between the phase space path integral in
(2+1)-dimensional gravity and the canonical quantization of the corresponding
reduced phase space in the York time slicing. I demonstrate the equivalence of
these two approaches, and discuss some subtleties in the definition of the path
integral necessary to prove this equivalence.
