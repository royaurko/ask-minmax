In this paper, we study the second member of the second Painlev\'e hierarchy
$P_{II}^{(2)}$. We show that the birational transformations take this equation
to the polynomial Hamiltonian system in dimension four, and this Hamiltonian
system can be considered as a 1-parameter family of coupled Painlev\'e systems.
This Hamiltonian is new. We also show that this system admits extended affine
Weyl group symmetry of type $A_1^{(1)}$, and can be recovered by its holomorphy
conditions. We also study a fifth-order ordinary differential equation
satisfied by this Hamiltonian. After we transform this equation into a system
of the first-order ordinary differential equations of polynomial type in
dimension five by birational transformations, we give its symmetry and
holomorphy conditions.
