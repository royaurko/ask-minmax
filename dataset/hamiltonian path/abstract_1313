With the recent advances in electrical engineering, devices attached to
free-ranging marine mammals today can collect oceanographic data in remarkable
high spatial-temporal resolution. However, those data cannot be fully utilized
without a matching high-resolution and accurate path of the animal, which is
currently missing in this field. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian melding
approach based on a Brownian Bridge process to combine the fine-resolution but
seriously biased Dead-Reckoned path and the precise but sparse GPS
measurements, which results in an accurate and high-resolution estimated path
together with credible bands as quantified uncertainty statements. We also
exploit the properties of underlying processes and some approximations to the
likelihood to dramatically reduce the computational burden of handling those
big high resolution data sets.
