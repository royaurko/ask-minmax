This paper offers a geometric framework for modeling port-Hamiltonian systems
on discrete manifolds. The simplicial Dirac structure, capturing the
topological laws of the system, is defined in terms of primal and dual cochains
related by the coboundary operators. This finite-dimensional Dirac structure,
as discrete analogue of the canonical Stokes-Dirac structure, allows for the
formulation of finite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems that emulate the
behaviour of the open distributed-parameter systems with Hamiltonian dynamics.
