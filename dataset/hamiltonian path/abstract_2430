The Pauli-Hamiltonian of a molecule with fixed nuclei in a strong constant
magnetic field is asymptotic, in norm-resolvent sense, to an effective
Hamiltonian which has the form of a multi-particle Schr\"odinger operator with
interactions given by one-dimensional \delta-potentials. We study this
effective Hamiltonian in the case of the H2 -molecule and establish existence
of the ground state. We also show that the inter-nuclear equilibrium distance
tends to 0 as the field-strength tends to infinity.
