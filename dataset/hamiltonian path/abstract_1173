By exploiting the error functions of explicit symplectic integrators for
solving separable Hamiltonians, I show that it is possible to develop explicit,
time-reversible symplectic integrators for solving non-separable Hamiltonians
of the product form. The algorithms are unusual in that they of fractional
order.
