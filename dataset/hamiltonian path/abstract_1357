A canonical Hamiltonian formalism is derived for a class of Ermakov systems
specified by several different frequency functions. This class of systems
comprises all known cases of Hamiltonian Ermakov systems and can always be
reduced to quadratures. The Hamiltonian structure is explored to find exact
solutions for the Calogero system and for a noncentral potential with dynamic
symmetry. Some generalizations of these systems possessing exact solutions are
also identified and solved.
