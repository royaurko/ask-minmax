This paper expounds the relations between continuous symmetries and conserved
quantities, i.e. Noether's ``first theorem'', in both the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian frameworks for classical mechanics. This illustrates one of
mechanics' grand themes: exploiting a symmetry so as to reduce the number of
variables needed to treat a problem.
  I emphasise that, for both frameworks, the theorem is underpinned by the idea
of cyclic coordinates; and that the Hamiltonian theorem is more powerful. The
Lagrangian theorem's main ``ingredient'', apart from cyclic coordinates, is the
rectification of vector fields afforded by the local existence and uniqueness
of solutions to ordinary differential equations. For the Hamiltonian theorem,
the main extra ingredients are the asymmetry of the Poisson bracket, and the
fact that a vector field generates canonical transformations iff it is
Hamiltonian.
