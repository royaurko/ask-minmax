We compute the bi-Hamiltonian cohomology of an arbitrary dispersionless
Poisson pencil in a single dependent variable using a spectral sequence method.
As in the KdV case, we obtain that $BH^p_d(\hat{F}, d_1,d_2)$ is isomorphic to
$\mathbb{R}$ for $(p,d)=(0,0)$, to $C^\infty (\mathbb{R})$ for $(p,d)=(1,1)$,
$(2,1)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,3)$, and vanishes otherwise.
