We study sufficient conditions for Hamiltonian cycles in hypergraphs, and
obtain both Tur\'an- and Dirac-type results. While the Tur\'an-type result
gives an exact threshold for the appearance of a Hamiltonian cycle in a
hypergraph depending only on the extremal number of a certain path, the
Dirac-type result yields a sufficient condition relying solely on the minimum
vertex degree.
