The aim of this note is to prove a result of effective stability for a
non-autonomous perturbation of an integrable Hamiltonian system, provided that
the perturbation depends slowly on time. Then we use this result to clarify and
extend a stability result of Giorgilli and Zehnder for a mechanical system with
an arbitrary time-dependent potential.
