We derive an effective spin Hamiltonian for the one-dimensional half-filled
tetramerized ionic-Hubbard model in the limit of strong on-site repulsion. We
show that the effective Hamiltonian which describes the low-energy spin sector
of the model is a spin S=1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian with alternating
nearest-neighbour exchange.
