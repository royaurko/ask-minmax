In this note we try to prove the absence of the ghosts in case of the general
non-linear massive gravity action in Stuckelberg formalism. We argue that in
order to find the explicit form of the Hamiltonian it is natural to start with
the general non-linear massive gravity action found in arXiv:1106.3344
[hep-th]. We perform the complete Hamiltonian analysis of the Stuckelberg form
of the minimal the non-linear gravity action in this formulation and show that
the constraint structure is so rich that it is possible to eliminate
non-physical modes. Then we extend this analysis to the case of the general
non-linear massive gravity action. We find the corresponding Hamiltonian and
collection of the primary constraints. Unfortunately we are not able to finish
the complete analysis of the stability of all constraints due to the complex
form of one primary constraint so that we are not able to determine the
conditions under which given constraint is preserved during the time evolution
of the system.
