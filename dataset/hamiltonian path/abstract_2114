The next-to-next-to-leading order post-Newtonian spin-orbit and
spin(1)-spin(2) Hamiltonians for binary compact objects in general relativity
are derived. The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner canonical formalism and its
generalization to spinning compact objects in general relativity are presented
and a fully reduced matter-only Hamiltonian is obtained. Several
simplifications using integrations by parts are discussed. Approximate
solutions to the constraints and evolution equations of motion are provided.
Technical details of the integration procedures are given including an analysis
of the short-range behavior of the integrands around the sources. The
Hamiltonian of a test-spin moving in a stationary Kerr spacetime is obtained by
rather simple approach and used to check parts of the mentioned results.
Kinematical consistency checks by using the global (post-Newtonian approximate)
Poincar\'e algebra are applied. Along the way a self-contained overview for the
computation of the 3PN ADM point-mass Hamiltonian is provided, too.
