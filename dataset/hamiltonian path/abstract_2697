The non-crossing rule for the energy levels of a parameter-dependent
Hamiltonian is revisited and a flaw in a commonly accepted proof is revealed.
Some aspects of avoided crossings are illustrated by means of simple models.
One of them shows the close relationship between avoided crossings and
exceptional points.
