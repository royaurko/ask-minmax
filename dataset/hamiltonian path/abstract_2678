The structural invariant subspaces of the discrete-time singular Hamiltonian
system are used in 1] to give an analytic nonrecursive expression of all the
admissible trajectories. A deeper insight into the features of these subspaces,
particularly focused on the dimensionality issue, is the object of this note.
