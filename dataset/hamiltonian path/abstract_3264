We give a unified description of all recent spin foam models introduced by
Engle, Livine, Pereira and Rovelli (ELPR) and by Freidel and Krasnov (FK). We
show that the FK models are, for all values of the Immirzi parameter,
equivalent to path integrals of a discrete theory and we provide an explicit
formula for the associated actions. We discuss the relation between the FK and
ELPR models and also study the corresponding boundary states. For general
Immirzi parameter, these are given by Alexandrov's and Livine's SO(4) projected
states. For 0 <= gamma < 1, the states can be restricted to SU(2) spin
networks.
