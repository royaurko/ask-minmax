A formula to investigate wave effect in multi-lens system is presented on the
basis of path integral formalism by generalizing the work by Nakamura and
Deguchi (1999). Wave effect of a system with two lenses is investigated in an
analytic way as a simple application to demonstrate usefulness of the formula
and variety of wave effect in multi-lens system.
