We derive a canonical form for smooth vector fields on $\Re^{n+1}$. We use
this to demonstrate the local multi-Hamiltonian nature of the corresponding
flows. Associated with the canonical form is an inhomogenious linear PDE whose
solutions provide conserved measures. These can be used to construct the local
Hamiltonians.
