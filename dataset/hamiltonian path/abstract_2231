The Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity on a null surface is
established in the teleparallel geometry. No particular gauge conditons on the
tetrads are imposed, such as the time gauge condition. By means of a 3+1
decomposition the resulting Hamiltonian arises as a completely constrained
system. However, it is structurally different from the the standard
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) type formulation. In this geometrical framework the
basic field quantities are tetrads that transform under the global SO(3,1) and
the torsion tensor.
