We study the quantum-mechanical interpretation of models with non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians and real spectra. We set up a general framework for the analysis
of such systems in terms of Hermitian Hamiltonians defined in the usual Hilbert
space $L_2(-\infty,\infty)$. Special emphasis is put on the correct definition
of the algebra of physical observables. Within this scheme we consider various
examples, including the model recently introduced by Cannata et al. and the
model of Hatano and Nelson.
