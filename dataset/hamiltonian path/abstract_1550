We establish a procedure to find the extremal density matrices for any finite
Hamiltonian of a qudit system. These extremal density matrices provide an
approximate description of the energy spectra of the Hamiltonian. In the case
of restricting the extremal density matrices by pure states, we show that the
energy spectra of the Hamiltonian is recovered for $d=2$ and $3$. We conjecture
that by means of this approach the energy spectra can be recovered for the
Hamiltonian of an arbitrary finite qudit system. For a given qudit system
Hamiltonian, we find new inequalities connecting the mean value of the
Hamiltonian and the entropy of an arbitrary state. We demonstrate that these
inequalities take place for both the considered extremal density matrices and
generic ones.
