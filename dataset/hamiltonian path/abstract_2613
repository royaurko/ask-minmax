We construct the scattering matrices for an arbitrary Weyl group in terms of
elementary operators which obey the generalised Yang-Baxter equation. We use
this construction to obtain the affine Hecke algebras. The center of the affine
Hecke algebras coincides with commuting Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians have
q-deformed affine Lie algebras as symmetry algebra.
