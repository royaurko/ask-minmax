We introduce a path to a possibly new class of magnetic materials whose
properties are determined entirely by the presence of a low concentration of
specific point defects in their crystal structure. Using model Hamiltonian and
ab-initio band structure methods we demonstrate that even large band gap
nonmagnetic materials as simple as CaO can exhibit extraordinary properties
like half metallic ferromagnetism upon introducing a small concentration of Ca
vacancies. We show that such defects will initially bind the introduced charge
carriers at neighboring sites and depending on the internal symmetry of the
clusters formed by neighboring sites form "local" magnetic moments which for
concentrations as low as 3% transform this non-magnetic insulator into a half
metallic ferromagnet.
