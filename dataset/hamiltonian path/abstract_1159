We show that non-relativistic and relativistic mechanical systems on a
configuration space Q can be seen as the conservative Dirac constraint systems
with zero Hamiltonians on different subbundles of the same cotangent bundle
T^*Q. The geometric quantization of this cotangent bundle under the vertical
polarization leads to compatible covariant quantizations of non-relativistic
and relativistic Hamiltonian mechanics.
