In this paper we established the condition for a curve to satisfy stochas-
tic fractional HP (Hamilton-Pontryagin) equations. These equations are
described using It^o integral. We have also considered the case of stochastic
fractional Hamiltonian equa- tions, for a hyperregular Lagrange function. From
the stochastic fractional Hamiltonian equations, Langevin fractional equations
were found and numerical simulations were done.
