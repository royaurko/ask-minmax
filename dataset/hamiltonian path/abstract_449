The Problem of Time in Quantum Gravity is analyzed from a classical
presymplectic perspective. In the first part of the paper the Three Space
Approach to General Relativity is introduced via the Barbour-Foster-\'O
Murchadha action and the dynamics corresponding to a theory of relativistic
gravity where spacetime is not an a priori requirement. We also look into the
nature and physical interpretation of the constraints in this theory and
compare them with those of Standard ADM General Relativity. We then study the
presymplectic phase space of three space general relativity and discuss briefly
the notion of observables and perennials of the system. We then move on to
re-deriving the ephemeris lapse identification, and then discuss the notion of
re-foliation invariance and its resolution in the conformal theory. Further, we
study a new perspective of three space general relativity involving a
Hamiltonian reduction of the phase space and subsequently, we discuss the path
integral quantization of the same.
