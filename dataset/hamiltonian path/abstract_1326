y formally diagonalizing with accuracy $\hbar$ the Hamiltonian of electrons
in a crystal subject to electromagnetic perturbations, we resolve the debate on
the Hamiltonian nature of semiclassical equations of motion with Berry-phase
corrections, and therefore confirm the validity of the Liouville theorem. We
show that both the position and momentum operators acquire a Berry-phase
dependence, leading to a non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics. The equations of
motion turn out to be identical to the ones previously derived in the context
of electron wave-packets dynamics.
