In this paper we study the dynamics near the equilibrium point of a family of
Hamiltonian systems in the neighborhood of a $0^2 iw$ resonance. The existence
of a family of periodic orbits surrounding the equilibrium is well-known and we
show here the existence of homoclinic connections with several loops for every
periodic orbit close to the origin, except the origin itself. To prove this
result, we first show a Hamiltonian normal form theorem inspired by the
Elphick-Tirapegui-Brachet-Coullet-Iooss normal form. We then use a local
Hamiltonian normalization relying on a result of Moser. We obtain the result of
existence of homoclinic orbits by geometrical arguments based on the low
dimension and with the aid of a KAM theorem which allows to confine the loops.
The same problem was studied before for reversible non Hamiltonian
vectorfields, and the splitting of the homoclinic orbits lead to exponentially
small terms which prevent the existence of homoclinic connections to
exponentially small periodic orbits. The same phenomenon occurs here but we get
round this difficulty thanks to geometric arguments specific to Hamiltonian
systems and by studying homoclinic orbits with many loops.
