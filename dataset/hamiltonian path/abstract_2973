We consider a single particle tunnelling in a tight-binding model with
nearest-neighbour couplings, in the presence of a periodic high-frequency
force. An effective Hamiltonian for the particle is derived using an averaging
method resembling classical canonical perturbation theory. Three cases are
considered: uniform lattice with periodic and open boundary conditions, and
lattice with a parabolic potential. We find that in the latter case, interplay
of the potential and driving leads to appearence of the effective next-nearest
neighbour couplings. In the uniform case with periodic boundary conditions the
second- and third-order corrections to the averaged Hamiltonian are completely
absent, while in the case with open boundary conditions they have a very simple
form, found before in some particular cases by S.Longhi [Phys. Rev. B 77,
195326 (2008)]. These general results may found applications in designing
effective Hamiltonian models in experiments with ultracold atoms in optical
lattices, e.g. for simulating solid-state phenomena.
