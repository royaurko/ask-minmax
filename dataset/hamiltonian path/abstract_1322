We consider diffusion-like paths that are explored by a particle moving via a
conservative force while being in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. To
probe rare transitions, we use the Onsager-Machlup (OM) functional as a
thermodynamic action to form the path probability distribution function for
double-ended paths that are constrained to start and stop at predesignated
points after a fixed time. In the continuous- time limit, the OM functional has
been commonly replaced by the Ito-Girsanov change of measure to give the
probability of the path created by the physical dynamics relative to that of a
free particle. Here we show that this continuous-time limit does not, and
cannot, generate a thermodynamic ensemble of paths.
