We have established that the mean photon number obtained employing the
conventional Hamiltonian for the twin light beams with the same frequency,
produced by a subharmonic generator, is half that of the twin light beams with
different frequencies. In view of this, we have found it to be quite
appropriate to describe the process of subharmonic generation by the same
Hamiltonian regardless of whether the twin light beams have the same or
different frequencies. Applying this Hamiltonian, we have calculated the photon
statistics and quadrature squeezing for the signal-signal and the signal-idler
modes. Obviously, this time the mean photon number of the signal-signal modes
is exactly the same as that of the signal-idler modes. In addition, we have
found that the maximum global quadrature squeezing of the signal-signal or the
signal-idler modes is 50$\%$ below the vacuum-state level and the maximum local
quadrature squeezing of the signal-signal modes is 74.9$\%$ below the same
level.
