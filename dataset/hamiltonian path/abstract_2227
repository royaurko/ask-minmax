We introduce a Hamiltonian dynamics for the description of long-range
interacting systems in contact with a thermal bath (i.e., in the canonical
ensemble). The dynamics confirms statistical mechanics equilibrium predictions
for the Hamiltonian Mean Field model and the equilibrium ensemble equivalence.
We find that long-lasting quasi-stationary states persist in presence of the
interaction with the environment. Our results indicate that quasi-stationary
states are indeed reproducible in real physical experiments.
