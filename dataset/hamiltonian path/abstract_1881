We compute explicitly (modulo solutions of certain algebraic equations) the
spectra of infinite graphs obtained by attaching one or several infinite paths
to some vertices of certain finite graphs. The main result concerns a canonical
form of the adjacency matrix of such infinite graphs. A complete answer is
given in the case when the number of attached paths to each vertex is the same.
