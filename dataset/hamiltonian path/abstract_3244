The phase-space paths introduced by Cheuk-Yin Wong in Phys. Rev.C25, 1460
(1982) and discussed recently in the literature can be used for calculation of
evolution of the Wigner function to first order in the time increments only.
The first-order solutions are helpful to determine the phase-space Green
function in the framework of the phase-space path integral method.
