We investigate the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition for hexatic order on a free
fluctuating membrane and derive both a Coulomb gas and a sine-Gordon
Hamiltonian to describe it. The Coulomb-gas Hamiltonian includes charge
densities arising from disclinations and from Gaussian curvature. There is an
interaction coupling the difference between these two densities, whose strength
is determined by the hexatic rigidity, and an interaction coupling Gaussian
curvature densities arising from the Liouville Hamiltonian resulting from the
imposition of a covariant cutoff. In the sine-Gordon Hamiltonian, there is a
linear coupling between a scalar field and the Gaussian curvature. We discuss
gauge-invariant correlation function for hexatic order and the dielectric
constant of the Coulomb gas. We also derive renormalization group recursion
relations that predict a transition with decreasing bending rigidity $\kappa$.
