We study the completions of the space of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of the
standard linear symplectic space, for Viterbo's distance and some others
derived from it, we study their different inclusions and give some of their
properties. In particular, we give a convergence criterion for these distances.
This allows us to prove that the completions contain non-ordinary elements, as
for example, discontinuous Hamiltonians. We also prove that some dynamical
properties of Hamiltonian systems are preserved in the completions.
