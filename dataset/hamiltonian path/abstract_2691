We investigate a family of integrable Hamiltonian systems on Lie-Poisson
spaces $\mathcal{L}_+(5)$ dual to Lie algebras $\mathfrak{so}_{\lambda,
\alpha}(5)$ being two-parameter deformations of $\mathfrak{so}(5)$. We
integrate corresponding Hamiltonian equations on $\mathcal{L}_+(5)$ and
$T^*\mathbb{R}^5$ by quadratures as well as discuss their possible physical
interpretation.
