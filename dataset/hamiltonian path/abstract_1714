In this paper we studied infinite weighted automata and a general methodology
to solve a wide variety of classical lattice path counting problems in an
uniform way. This counting problems are related to Dyck paths, Motzkin paths
and some generalizations. These methodology uses weighted automata, equations
of ordinary generating functions and continued fractions. It is a variation of
the one proposed by J. Rutten.
