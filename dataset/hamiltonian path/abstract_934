Sensors placed in agricultural field should have long network life. Failure
of node or link allows rerouting and establishing a new path from the source to
the sink. In this paper, a new path is established such that it is energy aware
during path discovery and is active for longer interval of time once it is
established. The parameters used for simulation are as those used in
agricultural application.
