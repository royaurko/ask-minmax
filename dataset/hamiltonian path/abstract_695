The time evolution in a supersymmetric extension of the Kodomtsev-Petviashvilli
hierarchy, a classical integrable system, is shown to be Hamiltonian. The
canonical bracket associated to the Hamiltonian evolution is the classical
analog of the antibracket encountered in the quantization of gauge theories.
This provides a new understanding of supersymmetric Hamiltonian systems.
