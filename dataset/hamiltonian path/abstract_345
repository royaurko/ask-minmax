Non scaling Fixed-Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) accelerators have an
unprecedented potential for muon acceleration, as well as for medical purposes
based on carbon and proton hadron therapy. They also represent a possible
active element for an Accelerator Driven Subcritical Reactor (ADSR). Starting
from first principle the Hamiltonian formalism for the description of the
dynamics of particles in non scaling FFAG machines has been developed. The
stationary reference (closed) orbit has been found within the Hamiltonian
framework. The dependence of the path length on the energy deviation has been
described in terms of higher order dispersion functions. The latter have been
used subsequently to specify the longitudinal part of the Hamiltonian. It has
been shown that higher order phase slip coefficients should be taken into
account to adequately describe the acceleration in non scaling FFAG
accelerators. A complete theory of the fast (serpentine) acceleration in non
scaling FFAGs has been developed. An example of the theory is presented for the
parameters of the Electron Machine with Many Applications (EMMA), a prototype
electron non scaling FFAG to be hosted at Daresbury Laboratory.
