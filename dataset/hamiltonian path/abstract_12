Introducing a perturbative definition, phase space path integrals can be
calculated without slicing. This leads to a short-time expansion of the
quantum-mechanical path amplitude, or a high-temperature expansion of the
unnormalized density matrix, respectively. We use the proposed formalism to
calculate the effective classical Hamiltonian for the harmonic oscillator.
