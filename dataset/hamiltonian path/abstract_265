A generalization of the concept of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians H=p^2+V(x) is
described. It uses analytic potentials V(x) (with singularities) and a
generalized concept of PT-symmetric asymptotic boundary conditions. Nontrivial
toboggans are defined as integrated along topologically nontrivial paths of
coordinates running over several Riemann sheets of wave functions.
