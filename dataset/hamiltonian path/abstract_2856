For an invertible (bounded) linear operator Q acting in a Hilbert space
${\cal H}$, we consider the consequences of the QT-symmetry of a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian $H:{\cal H}\to{\cal H}$ where T is the time-reversal operator. If H
is symmetric in the sense that ${\cal T} H^\dagger {\cal T}=H$, then
QT-symmetry is equivalent to Q^{-1}-weak-pseudo-Hermiticity. But in general
this equivalence does not hold. We show this using some specific examples.
Among these is a large class of non-PT-symmetric Hamiltonians that share the
spectral properties of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians.
