We present the derivation of the effective higher-order Hamiltonian, which
gives $m \alpha^6$ contribution to energy levels of an arbitrary light atom.
The derivation is based on the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation of the
one-particle Dirac Hamiltonian followed by perturbative expansion of the many
particle Green function. The obtained results can be used for the high
precision calculation of relativistic effects in atomic systems.
