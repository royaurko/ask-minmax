The nonlinear selfdual variational principle established in a preceeding
paper [8] -- though good enough to be readily applicable in many stationary
nonlinear partial differential equations -- did not however cover the case of
nonlinear evolutions such as the Navier-Stokes equations. One of the reasons is
the prohibitive coercivity condition that is not satisfied by the corresponding
selfdual functional on the relevant path space. We show here that such a
principle still hold for functionals of the form
  I(u)= \int_0^T \Big [ L (t, u(t),\dot {u}(t)+\Lambda u(t)) +< \Lambda u(t),
u(t) > \Big ] dt +\ell (u(0)- u(T), \frac {u(T)+ u(0)}{2})
 where $L$ (resp., $\ell$) is an anti-selfdual Lagrangian on state space
(resp., boundary space), and $\Lambda$ is an appropriate nonlinear operator on
path space. As a consequence, we provide a variational formulation and
resolution to evolution equations involving nonlinear operators such as the
Navier-Stokes equation (in dimensions 2 and 3) with various boundary
conditions. In dimension 2, we recover the well known solutions for the
corresponding initial-value problem as well as periodic and anti-periodic ones,
while in dimension 3 we get Leray solutions for the initial-value problems, but
also solutions satisfying $u(0)=\alpha u(T)$ for any given $\alpha$ in
$(-1,1)$. Our approach is quite general and does apply to many other
situations.
