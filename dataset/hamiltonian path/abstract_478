We count the number of lattice paths lying under a cyclically shifting
piecewise linear boundary of varying slope. Our main result extends well known
enumerative formulae concerning lattice paths, and its derivation involves a
classical reflection argument. A refinement allows for the counting of paths
with a specified number of corners. We also apply the result to examine paths
dominated by periodic boundaries.
