A graph has the unique path property UPP_n if there is a unique path of
length n between any ordered pair of nodes.
  This paper reiterates Royle and MacKay's technique for constructing orderly
algorithms. We wish to use this technique to enumerate all UPP_2 graphs of
small orders 9 and 16. We attempt to use the direct graph formalism and find
that the algorithm is inefficient.
  We introduce a generalised problem and derive algebraic and combinatoric
structures with appropriate structure. We are able to then design an orderly
algorithm to determine all UPP_2 graphs of order 9, which runs fast enough. We
hope to be able to determine the UPP_2 graphs of order 16 in the near future.
