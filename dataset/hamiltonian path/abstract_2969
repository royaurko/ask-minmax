We discuss the two-dimensional isotropic antiferromagnet in the framework of
gauge invariance. Gauge invariance is one of the most subtle useful concepts in
theoretical physics, since it allows one to describe the time evolution of
complex physical systesm in arbitrary sequences of reference frames. All
theories of the fundamental interactions rely on gauge invariance. In Dirac's
approach, the two-dimensional isotropic antiferromagnet is subject to second
class constraints, which are independent of the Hamiltonian symmetries and can
be used to eliminate certain canonical variables from the theory. We have used
the symplectic embedding formalism developed by a few of us to make the system
under study gauge-invariant. After carrying out the embedding and Dirac
analysis, we systematically show how second class constraints can generate
hidden symmetries. We obtain the invariant second-order Lagrangian and the
gauge-invariant model Hamiltonian. Finally, for a particular choice of factor
ordering, we derive the functional Schr\"odinger equations for the original
Hamiltonian and for the first class Hamiltonian and show them to be identical,
which justifies our choice of factor ordering.
