In high-dimensional data analysis, penalized likelihood estimators are shown
to provide superior results in both variable selection and parameter
estimation. A new algorithm, APPLE, is proposed for calculating the Approximate
Path for Penalized Likelihood Estimators. Both the convex penalty (such as
LASSO) and the nonconvex penalty (such as SCAD and MCP) cases are considered.
The APPLE efficiently computes the solution path for the penalized likelihood
estimator using a hybrid of the modified predictor-corrector method and the
coordinate-descent algorithm. APPLE is compared with several well-known
packages via simulation and analysis of two gene expression data sets.
