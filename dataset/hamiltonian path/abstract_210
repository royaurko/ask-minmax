In this paper, we apply spectral invariants, constructed in [Oh5,8], to the
study of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of closed symplectic manifolds
$(M,\omega)$. Using spectral invariants, we first construct an invariant norm
called the {\it spectral norm} on the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group and
obtain several lower bounds for the spectral norm in terms of the
$\e$-regularity theorem and the symplectic area of certain pseudo-holomorphic
curves. We then apply spectral invariants to the study of length minimizing
properties of certain Hamiltonian paths {\it among all paths}. In addition to
the construction of spectral invariants, these applications rely heavily on the
{\it chain level Floer theory} and on some existence theorems with energy
bounds of pseudo-holomorphic sections of certain Hamiltonian fibrations with
prescribed monodromy. The existence scheme that we develop in this paper in
turn relies on some careful geometric analysis involving {\it adiabatic
degeneration} and {\it thick-thin decomposition} of the Floer moduli spaces
which has an independent interest of its own.
  We assume that $(M,\omega)$ is {\it strongly semi-positive} throughout, which
will be removed in a sequel.
