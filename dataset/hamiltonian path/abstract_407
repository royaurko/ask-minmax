The theory of anti-selfdual (ASD) Lagrangians developed in \cite{G2} allows a
variational resolution for equations of the form $\Lambda u+Au +\partial \phi
(u)+f=0$ where $\phi$ is a convex lower-semi-continuous function on a reflexive
Banach space $X$, $f\in X^*$, $A: D(A)\subset X\to X^*$ is a positive linear
operator and where $\Lambda: D(\Lambda)\subset X\to X^{*}$ is a non-linear
operator that satisfies suitable continuity and anti-symmetry properties. ASD
Lagrangians on path spaces also yield variational resolutions for nonlinear
evolution equations of the form $\dot u (t)+\Lambda u(t)+Au(t) +f\in -\partial
\phi (u(t))$ starting at $u(0)=u_{0}$. In both stationary and dynamic cases,
the equations associated to the proposed variational principles are not derived
from the fact they are critical points of the action functional, but because
they are also zeroes of the Lagrangian itself.The approach has many
applications, in particular to Navier-Stokes type equations and to the
differential systems of hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics and
thermohydraulics.
