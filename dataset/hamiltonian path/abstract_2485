In this paper we will present Lagrangian and Hamiltonian $k$-symplectic
formalisms, we will recall the notions of symmetry and conservation law and we
will define the notion of pseudosymmetry as a natural extension of symmetry.
Using symmetries and pseudosymmetries, without the help of a Noether type
theorem, we will obtain new kinds of conservation laws for $k$-symplectic
Hamiltonian systems and $k$-symplectic Lagrangian systems.
