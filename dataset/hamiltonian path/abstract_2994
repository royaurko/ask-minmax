We consider a two-level system such as a two-level atom, interacting with a
cavity field mode in the rotating wave approximation, when the atomic
transition frequency or the field mode frequency is periodically driven in
time. We show that in both cases, for an appropriate choice of the modulation
parameters, the state amplitudes in a generic $n${-}excitation subspace obey
the same equations of motion that can be obtained from a \emph{static}
non-Hermitian Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian with ${\mathcal PT}$ symmetry, that
is with an imaginary coupling constant. This gives further support to recent
results showing the possible physical interest of ${\mathcal PT}$ symmetric
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We also generalize the well-known diagonalization
of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian to the non-Hermitian case in terms of
pseudo-bosons and pseudo-fermions, and discuss relevant mathematical and
physical aspects.
