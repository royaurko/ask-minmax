We design toy protein mimicking a machine-like function of an enzyme. Using
an insight gained by the study of conformation space of compact lattice
polymers, we demonstrate the possibility of a large scale conformational
rearrangement which occurs (i) without opening a compact state, and (ii) along
a linear (one-dimensional) path. We also demonstrate the possibility to extend
sequence design method such that it yields a "collective funnel" landscape in
which the toy protein (computationally) folds into the valley with
rearrangement path at its bottom. Energies of the states along the path can be
designed to be about equal, allowing for diffusion along the path. They can
also be designed to provide for a significant bias in one certain direction.
Together with a toy ligand molecule, our "enzimatic" machine can perform the
entire cycle, including conformational relaxation in one direction upon ligand
binding and conformational relaxation in the opposite direction upon ligand
release. This model, however schematic, should be useful as a test ground for
phenomenological theories of machine-like properties of enzymes.
