Starting from the kp method in combination with first-principles
calculations, we systematically derive the effective Hamiltonians that capture
the low energy band structures of recently discovered topological Kondo
insulator SmB6. Using these effective Hamiltonians we can obtain both the
energy dispersion and the spin texture of the topological surface states, which
can be detected by further experiments.
