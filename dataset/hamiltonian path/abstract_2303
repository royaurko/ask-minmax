We consider a one-parameter family of non-evolutionary partial differential
equations which includes the integrable Camassa-Holm equation and a new
equation first isolated by Degasperis and Procesi. A Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
formulation is presented for the whole family of equations, and we discuss how
this fits into a bi-Hamiltonian framework in the integrable cases. The
Hamiltonian dynamics of peakons and some other special finite-dimensional
reductions are also described.
