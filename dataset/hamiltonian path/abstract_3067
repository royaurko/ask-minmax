Using Path Integral Monte Carlo and the Maximum Entropy method, we calculate
the dynamic structure factor of solid He-3 in the bcc phase at a finite
temperature of T = 1.6 K and a molar volume of 21.5 cm^3. From the single
phonon dynamic structure factor, we obtain both the longitudinal and transverse
phonon branches along the main crystalline directions, [001], [011] and [111].
Our results are compared with other theoretical predictions and available
experimental data.
