The zero-field $^{139}$La and $^{55}$Mn nuclear magnetic resonances were
studied in $\rm La_{0.8}Ca_{0.2}MnO_{3+\delta}$ with different oxygen
stoichiometry $\delta$. The signal intensity, peak frequency and line
broadening of the $^{139}$La NMR spectrum show that excess oxygens have a
tendency to concentrate and establish local ferromagnetic ordering around
themselves. These connect the previously existed ferromagnetic clusters
embedded in the antiferromagnetic host, resulting in percolative conduction
paths. This phase separation is not a charge segregation type, but a
electroneutral type. The magnetoresistance peak at the temperature where
percolative paths start to form provides a direct evidence that phase
separation is one source of colossal magnetoresistance effect.
