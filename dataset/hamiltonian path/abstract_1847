Bliem and Kousidis (arXiv:1109.4624) recently considered a family of random
variables whose distributions are given by the generalized Galois numbers
(after normalization). We give probabilistic interpretations of these random
variables, using inversions in random words, random lattice paths and random
Ferrers diagrams, and use these to give new proofs of limit theorems as well as
some further limit results.
