We describe a new type of sufficient condition for a balanced bipartite
digraph to be hamiltonian. Let $D$ be a balanced bipartite digraph and $x,y$ be
distinct vertices in $D$. $\{x, y\}$ dominates a vertex $z$ if $x\rightarrow z$
and $y\rightarrow z$; in this case, we call the pair $\{x, y\}$ dominating. In
this paper, we prove that a strong balanced bipartite digraph $D$ on $2a$
vertices contains a hamiltonian cycle if, for every dominating pair of vertices
$\{x, y\}$, either $d(x)\ge 2a-1$ and $d(y)\ge a+1$ or $d(x)\ge a+1$ and
$d(y)\ge 2a-1$. The lower bound in the result is sharp.
