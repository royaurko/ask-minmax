We calculate the amount of polarization-entanglement induced by two-photon
interference at a lossless beam splitter. Entanglement and its witness are
quantified respectively by concurrence and the Bell-CHSH parameter. In the
presence of a Mandel dip, the interplay of two kinds of which-path information
-- temporal and polarization -- gives rise to the existence of entangled
polarization-states that cannot violate the Bell-CHSH inequality.
