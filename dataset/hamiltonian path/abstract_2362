The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian structures for an ideal gauge-charged fluid
are determined. Using a Kaluza-Klein point of view, the equations of motion are
obtained by Lagrangian and Poisson reductions associated to the automorphism
group of a principal bundle. As a consequence of the Lagrangian approach, a
Kelvin-Noether theorem is obtained. The Hamiltonian formulation determines a
non-canonical Poisson bracket associated to these equations.
