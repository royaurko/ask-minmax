It is shown that a given non-autonomous system of two first-order ordinary
differential equations can be expressed in Hamiltonian form. The derivation
presented here allow us to obtain previously known results such as the infinite
number of Hamiltonians in the autonomous case and the Helmholtz condition for
the existence of a Lagrangian.
