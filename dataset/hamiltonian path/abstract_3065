A translation invariant N-polaron system is investigated at arbitrary
electron-phonon coupling strength, using a variational principle for path
integrals for identical particles. An upper bound for the ground state energy
is found as a function of the number of spin up and spin down polarons, taking
the electron-electron interaction and the Fermi statistics into account. The
resulting addition energies and the criteria for multipolaron formation are
discussed.
