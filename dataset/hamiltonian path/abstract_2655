We solve a singe-particle Dirac equation with Woods-Saxon potentials using an
iterative method in the coordinate space representation. By maximizing the
expectation value of the inverse of the Dirac Hamiltonian, this method avoids
the variational collapse, in which an iterative solution dives into the Dirac
sea. We demonstrate that this method works efficiently, reproducing the exact
solutions of the Dirac equation.
