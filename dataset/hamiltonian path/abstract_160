The notion of a spiral unfolding of a convex polyhedron, resulting by
flattening a special type of Hamiltonian cut-path, is explored. The Platonic
and Archimedian solids all have nonoverlapping spiral unfoldings, although
among generic polyhedra, overlap is more the rule than the exception. The
structure of spiral unfoldings is investigated, primarily by analyzing one
particular class, the polyhedra of revolution.
