This article presents a derivation of the transport mean free path for
magneto-transverse light diffusion, $\ell^*_\perp$, in an arbitrary random
mixture of Faraday-active and non-Faraday active Mie scatterers. This
derivation is based on the standard radiative transfer equation. The expression
of the transport mean free path obtained previously from the Bethe-Salpether
equation, for the case where only Faraday-active scatterers are present,is
recovered. This simpler formulation can include the case of homogeneous
mixtures of Faraday-active and non-Faraday active scatterers.
