Multi-period measures of risk account for the path that the value of an
investment portfolio takes. The most widely used such path-dependent indicator
of risk is drawdown, which is a measure of decline from a historical peak in
cumulative returns. In the context of probabilistic risk measures, the focus
has been on one particular dimension of drawdown, its magnitude, and not on its
temporal dimension, its duration. In this paper, the concept of temporal
path-dependent risk measure is introduced to capture the risk associated with
the temporal dimension of a stochastic process. We analyze drawdown duration,
which measures the length of excursions below a running maximum, and
liquidation stopping time, which denotes the first time drawdown duration
exceeds a subjective liquidation threshold, in the context of coherent temporal
path-dependent risk measures and show that they, unlike drawdown magnitude, do
not satisfy any of the axioms for coherent risk measures. Despite its
non-coherence, we illustrate through an empirical example some of the insights
gained from analyzing drawdown duration in the investment process and discuss
the challenges of path-dependent risk estimation in practice.
