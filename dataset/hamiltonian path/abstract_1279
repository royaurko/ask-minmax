The multiple-pass optical cell is an important tool for laser absorption
spectroscopy and its many applications. For most practical applications, such
as trace-gas detection, a compact and robust design is essential. Here we
report an investigation into a multi-pass cell design based on a pair of
cylindrical mirrors, with a particular focus on achieving very long optical
paths. We demonstrate a path-length of 50.31 m in a cell with 40 mm diameter
mirrors spaced 88.9 mm apart - a 3-fold increase over the previously reported
longest path-length obtained with this type of cell configuration. We
characterize the mechanical stability of the cell and describe the practical
conditions necessary to achieve very long path-lengths.
