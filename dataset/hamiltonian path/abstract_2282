We show a $C^r$ connecting lemma for area-preserving surface diffeomorphisms
and for periodic Hamiltonian on surfaces. We prove that for a generic $C^r$,
$r=1, 2, ...$, $\infty$, area-preserving diffeomorphism on a compact orientable
surface, homotopic to identity, every hyperbolic periodic point has a
transversal homoclinic point. We also show that for a $C^r$, $r=1, 2, ...$,
$\infty$ generic time periodic Hamiltonian vector field in a compact orientable
surface, every hyperbolic periodic trajectory has a transversal homoclinic
point. The proof explores the special properties of diffeomorphisms that are
generated by Hamiltonian flows.
