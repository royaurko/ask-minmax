We compute the monoid of isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective
modules of a Leavitt path algebra over an arbitrary directed graph. Our result
generalizes the result of Ara, Moreno, and Pardo in which they computed this
monoid of a Leavitt path algebra over a countable row-finite directed graph.
