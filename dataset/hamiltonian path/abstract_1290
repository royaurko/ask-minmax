We consider the form of the path integral that follows from canonical
quantization and apply it to the first order form of the Einstein-Hilbert
action in $d > 2$ dimensions. We show that this is inequivalent to what is
obtained from applying the Faddeev-Popov (FP) procedure directly. Due to the
presence of tertiary first class constraints, the measure of the path integral
is found to have a substantially different structure from what arises in the FP
approach. In addition, the presence of second class constraints leads to
non-trivial ghosts, which cannot be absorbed into the normalization of the path
integral. The measure of the path integral lacks manifest covariance.
