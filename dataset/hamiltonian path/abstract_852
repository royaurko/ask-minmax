Multiphoton path entanglement is created without applying post-selection, by
manipulating the state of stimulated parametric down-conversion. A specific
measurement on one of the two output spatial modes leads to the non-local
bunching of the photons of the other mode, forming the desired multiphoton path
entangled state. We present experimental results for the case of a heralded
two-photon path entangled state and show how to extend this scheme to higher
photon numbers.
