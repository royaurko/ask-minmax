In the framework of Black-Scholes-Merton model of financial derivatives, a
path integral approach to option pricing is presented. A general formula to
price European path dependent options on multidimensional assets is obtained
and implemented by means of various flexible and efficient algorithms. As an
example, we detail the cases of Asian, barrier knock out, reverse cliquet and
basket call options, evaluating prices and Greeks. The numerical results are
compared with those obtained with other procedures used in quantitative finance
and found to be in good agreement. In particular, when pricing at-the-money and
out-of-the-money options, the path integral approach exhibits competitive
performances.
