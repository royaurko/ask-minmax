We construct almost invariant subspaces and the corresponding effective
Hamiltonian for magnetic Bloch bands. We also discuss the question of the
dynamics related to the effective Hamiltonian. We assume that the magnetic and
electric potentials are slowly varying perturbations of the potential of a
constant magnetic field and a periodic lattice potential, respectively.
