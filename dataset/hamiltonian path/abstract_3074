This paper details a new algorithm to solve the shortest path problem in
valued graphs. Its complexity is $O(D \log v)$ where $D$ is the graph diameter
and $v$ its number of vertices. This complexity has to be compared to the one
of the Dijkstra's algorithm, which is $O(e\log v)$ where $e$ is the number of
edges of the graph. This new algorithm lies on a hierarchical representation of
the graph, using radix trees. The performances of this algorithm show a major
improvement over the ones of the algorithms known up to now.
