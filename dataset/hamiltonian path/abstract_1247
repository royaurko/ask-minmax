Basing on the canonical quantization of a BRS invariant Lagrangian, we
construct holomorphic representation of path integrals for Faddeev-Popov(FP)
ghosts as well as for unphysical degrees of the gauge field from covariant
operator formalism. A thorough investigation of a simple soluble gauge model
with finite degrees will explain the metric structure of the Fock space and
constructions of path integrals for quantized gauge fields with FP ghosts. We
define fermionic coherent states even for a Fock space equipped with indefinite
metric to obtain path integral representations of a generating functional and
an effective action. The same technique will also be developed for path
integrals of unphysical degrees in the gauge field to find complete
correspondence, that insures cancellation of FP determinant, between FP ghosts
and unphysical components of the gauge field. As a byproduct, we obtain an
explicit form of Kugo-Ojima projection, $P^{(n)}$, to the subspace with
$n$-unphysical particles in terms of creation and annihilation operators for
the abelian gauge theory.
