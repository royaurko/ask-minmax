Regular path query languages for data graphs are essentially \emph{untyped}.
The lack of type information greatly limits the optimization opportunities for
query engines and makes application development more complex. In this paper we
discuss a simple, yet expressive, schema language for edge-labelled data
graphs. This schema language is, then, used to define a query type inference
approach with good precision properties.
