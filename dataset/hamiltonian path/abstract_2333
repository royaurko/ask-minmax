The bi-Hamiltonian structure is established for the perturbation equations of
KdV hierarchy and thus the perturbation equations themselves provide also
examples among typical soliton equations. Besides, a more general
bi-Hamiltonian integrable hierarchy is proposed and a remark is given for a
generalization of the resulting perturbation equations to $1+2$ dimensions.
