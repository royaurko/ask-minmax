The partition function of an oscillator disturbed by a set of electron
particle paths has been computed by a path integral method which permits to
evaluate at any temperature the relevant cumulant terms in the series
expansion. The time dependent source current peculiar of the semiclassical
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model induces large electron-phonon anharmonicities on the
phonon subsystem. As a main signature of anharmonicity the phonon heat capacity
shows a peak whose temperature location strongly varies with the strength of
the {\it e-ph} coupling. High energy oscillators are less sensitive to
anharmonic perturbations.
