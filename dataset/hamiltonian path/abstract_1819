We predict that if internal and momentum states of an interfering object are
correlated (entangled), then by measuring its internal state we may infer both
path (corpuscular) and phase (wavelike) information with much higher precision
than for objects lacking such entanglement. We thereby partly circumvent the
standard complementarity constraints of which-path detection.
