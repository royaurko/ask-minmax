We show the existence of a continuum of Hamiltonian structures for the
two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. In particular, a continuum of
Hamiltonian structures having noncommutative coordinates is presented. A study
of the symmetries of these structures is performed and their physical
plausibility is discussed.
