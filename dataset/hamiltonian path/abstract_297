A model Hamiltonian describing a two-level system with a crossing plus a
pairing force is investigated using technique of large-amplitude collective
motion. The collective path, which is determined by the decoupling conditions,
is found to be almost identical to the one in the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation for the case of a strong pairing force. For the weak pairing
case, the obtained path describes a diabatic dynamics of the system.
