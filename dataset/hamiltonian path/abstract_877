This is an introductory review of the connection between homotopy theory and
path integrals, mainly focus on works done by Schulman [23] that he compared
path integral on SO(3) and its universal covering space SU(2), DeWitt and
Laidlaw [15] that they proved the theorem to the case of path integrals on the
multiply-connected topological spaces. Also, we discuss the application of the
theorem in Aharonov-Bohm effect given by [20,24]. An informal introduction to
homotopy theory is provided for readers who are not familiar with the theory.
