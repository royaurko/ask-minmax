We consider small-time asymptotics for diffusion processes conditioned by
their initial and final positions, under the assumption that the diffusivity
has a sub-Riemannian structure, not necessarily of constant rank. We show that,
when the endpoints are joined by a unique path of minimal energy, the
conditioned diffusion converges weakly to that path. We show further that, when
the endpoints lie outside the sub-Riemannian cut locus, the fluctuations of the
conditioned diffusion from the minimal energy path, suitably rescaled, converge
to a Gaussian limit. The Gaussian limit is characterized in terms of the
minimal second variation of the energy functional at the minimal path, the
formulation of which is new in this context.
