The Conley-Zehnder index associates an integer to any continuous path of
symplectic matrices starting from the identity and ending at a matrix which
does not admit 1 as an eigenvalue. We give new ways to compute this index.
Robbin and Salamon define a generalization of the Conley-Zehnder index for any
continuous path of symplectic matrices; this generalization is half integer
valued. It is based on a Maslov-type index that they define for a continuous
path of Lagrangians in a symplectic vector space $(W,\bar{\Omega})$, having
chosen a given reference Lagrangian $V$. Paths of symplectic endomorphisms of
$(\R^{2n},\Omega_0)$ are viewed as paths of Lagrangians defined by their graphs
in $(W=\R^{2n}\oplus \R^{2n},\bar{\Omega}=\Omega_0\oplus -\Omega_0)$ and the
reference Lagrangian is the diagonal. Robbin and Salamon give properties of
this generalized Conley-Zehnder index and an explicit formula when the path has
only regular crossings. We give here an axiomatic characterization of this
generalized Conley-Zehnder index. We also give an explicit way to compute it
for any continuous path of symplectic matrices.
