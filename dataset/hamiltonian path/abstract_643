We prove an extension to the classical continuity theorem in rough paths. We
show that two $p$-rough paths are close in all levels of iterated integrals
provided the first $\lfl p \rfl$ terms are close in a uniform sense.
Applications include estimation of the difference of the signatures of two
uniformly close paths and convergence rates of Gaussian rough paths.
