We present theoretical calculations of the ensemble-averaged (a.k.a.
effective or coherent) wavefield propagating in a heterogeneous medium
considered as one realization of a random process. In the literature, it is
usually assumed that heterogeneity can be accounted for by a random scalar
function of the space coordinates, termed the potential. Physically, this
amounts to replacing the constant wavespeed in Helmholtz' equation by a
space-dependent speed. In the case of acoustic waves, we show that this
approach leads to incorrect results for the scattering mean-free path, no
matter how weak fluctuations are. The detailed calculation of the coherent
wavefield must take into account both a scalar and an operator part in the
random potential. When both terms have identical amplitudes, the correct value
for the scattering mean-free paths is shown to be more than four times smaller
(13/3, precisely) in the low frequency limit, whatever the shape of the
correlation function. Based on the diagrammatic approach of multiple
scattering, theoretical results are obtained for the self-energy and mean-free
path, within Bourret's and on-shell approximations. They are confirmed by
numerical experiments.
