We review our investigations on Gibbs measures relative to Brownian motion,
in particular the existence of such measures and their path properties,
uniqueness, resp. non-uniqueness. For the case when the energy only depends on
increments, we present a functional central limit theorem. We also explain
connections with other work and state open problems of interest.
