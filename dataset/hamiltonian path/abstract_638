There is a natural bijection between Dyck paths and basis diagrams of the
Temperley-Lieb algebra defined via tiling. Overhang paths are certain
generalisations of Dyck paths allowing more general steps but restricted to a
rectangle in the two-dimensional integer lattice. We show that there is a
natural bijection, extending the above tiling construction, between overhang
paths and basis diagrams of the Brauer algebra.
