In this paper, we prove that every planar 4-connected graph has a
CZ-representation---a string representation using paths in a rectangular grid
that contain at most one vertical segment. Furthermore, two paths representing
vertices $u,v$ intersect precisely once whenever there is an edge between $u$
and $v$. The required size of the grid is $n \times 2n$.
