We present a new type of clogging DoS attacks, with the highest amplification
factors achieved by off-path attackers, using only puppets, i.e., sandboxed
malware on victim machines. Specifically, we present off-path variants of the
Opt-ack, Ack-storm and Coremelt DoS attacks, achieving results comparable to
these achieved previously achieved by eavesdropping/MitM attackers and
(unrestricted) malware. In contrast to previous off-path attacks, which
attacked the client (machine) running the malware, our attacks address a very
different goal: large-scale clogging DoS of a third party, or even of backbone
connections.
  Our clogging attacks are based on off-path TCP injections. Indeed, as an
additional contribution, we present improved off-path TCP injection attacks.
Our new attacks significantly relax the requirements cf. to the known attacks;
specifically, our injection attack requires only a Java script in browser
sandbox (not 'restricted malware'), does not depend on specific operating
system properties, and is efficient even when client's port is determined using
recommended algorithm. Our attacks are constructed modularly, allowing reuse of
modules for other scenarios and replacing modules as necessary. We present
specific defenses, however, this work is further proof to the need to base
security on sound foundations, using cryptography to provide security even
against MitM attackers.
