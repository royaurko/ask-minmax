This paper is devoted to a description of integrable Hamiltonian hydrodynamic
chains associated with Dorfman Poisson brackets. Three main classes of these
hydrodynamic chains are selected. Generating functions of conservation laws and
commuting flows are found. Hierarchies of these Hamiltonian hydrodynamic chains
are extended on negative moments and negative time variables. Corresponding
three dimensional quasilinear equations of the second order are presented.
