The propagator for a certain class of two time-dependent coupled and driven
harmonic oscillators with time-varying angular frequencies and masses is
evaluated by path integration. This is simply done through suitably chosen
generalized canonical transformations and without presupposing the knownledge
of any auxiliary equation. The time-dependent oscillators system with an
exponentially growing masses and coupling coefficient in time may be considered
as particular case.
