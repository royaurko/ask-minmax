We show that the past and future of half-plane Brownian motion at certain
cutpoints are independent of each other after a conformal transformation. Like
in Ito's excursion theory, the pieces between cutpoints form a Poisson process
with respect to a local time. The size of the path as a function of this local
time is a stable subordinator whose index is given by the exponent of the
probability that a stretch of the path has no cutpoint. The index is computed
and equals 1/2.
