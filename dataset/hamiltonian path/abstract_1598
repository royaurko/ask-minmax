The identification of physical degrees of freedom is sometimes obscured in
the path integral formalism, and this makes it difficult to impose some
constraints or to do some approximations. I review a number of cases where the
difficulty is overcame by deriving the path integral from the operator form of
the partition function after such identification has been made.
