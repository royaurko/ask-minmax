We relate two conjectures which have been raised for classification of
Leavitt path algebras. For purely infinite simple unital Leavitt path algebras,
it is conjectured that K_0 classifies them completely. For arbitrary Leavitt
path algebras, it is conjectured that K^{\gr}_0 classifies them completely
\cite{hazann}. We show that for two finite graphs with no sinks (which their
associated Leavitt path algebras include the purely infinite simple ones) if
their K^{\gr}_0-groups of their Leavitt path algebras are isomorphic then their
K_0-groups are isomorphic as well.
