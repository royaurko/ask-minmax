This short note is devoted to the canonical analysis of the non-local
theories of gravity. We find their Hamiltonian and determine the algebra of
constraints. We perform this analysis for non-local theories of gravity
formulated both in Jordan and Einstein frame. The result of our analysis
suggests that Hamiltonian formulation does not bring to clear identification of
ghosts presence in non-local gravity.
