We present a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a
contractible, non-separating and noncontractible separating Hamiltonian cycle
in the edge graph of polyhedral maps on surfaces. In particular, we show the
existence of contractible Hamiltonian cycle in equivelar triangulated maps. We
also present an algorithm to construct such cycles whenever it exists.
