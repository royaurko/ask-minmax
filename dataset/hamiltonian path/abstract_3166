This paper is devoted to a study of mathematical structures arising from
choice functions satisfying the path independence property (Plott functions).
We broaden the notion of a choice function by allowing of empty choice. This
enables us to define a lattice structure on the set of Plott functions.
Moreover, this lattice is functorially dependent on its base. We introduce a
natural convex structure on the set of linear orders (or words) and show that
Plott functions are in one-to-one correspondence with convex subsets in this
set of linear orders. That correspondence is compatible with both lattice
structures. Keywords: Convex geometries, shuffle, linear orders, lattices,
