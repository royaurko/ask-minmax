By means of the adiabatic self-consistent collective coordinate method and
the pairing plus quadrupole interaction, we have obtained the selfconsistent
collective path connecting the oblate and prolate local minima in 68Se for the
first time. Along the collective path, the triaxial deformation parameter
(gamma) changes between 0 and 60 (degree) keeping the axially symmetric
deformation parameter (beta) approximately constant, indicating the importance
of triaxial deformation dynamics in the oblate-prolate shape coexistence
phenomena.
