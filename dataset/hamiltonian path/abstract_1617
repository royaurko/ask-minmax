Pion and kaon mean free paths within a thermal hadronic background are
calculated using relativistic kinetic theory. Free cross sections are used
which include contributions from $\rho$, $K^{*}$, $\Delta$ and heavier
resonances. Given pion to baryon ratios appropriate for the breakup stage of a
$200\cdot A$GeV relativistic-heavy-ion collision, we find for temperatures less
than 100 MeV, kaons have a shorter mean free path than pions, while for higher
breakup temperatures the reverse is true. Since breakup temperatures should be
in the neighborhood of 100 MeV, this suggests that kaon interferometry samples
the same emission distribution as pion interferometry.
