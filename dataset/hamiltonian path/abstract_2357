We prove that the Kupershmidt deformation of a bi-Hamiltonian system is
itself bi-Hamiltonian. Moreover, Magri hierarchies of the initial system give
rise to Magri hierarchies of Kupershmidt deformations as well. Since
Kupershmidt deformations are not written in evolution form, we start with an
outline a geometric framework to study Hamiltonian properties of general
non-evolution differential equations, developed in [2] (see also
arXiv:0812.4895).
