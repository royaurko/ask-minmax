Tunneling between the two lowest energy levels of single molecule magnets
with Ising type anisotropy, accompanied by the emission or absorption of
phonons, is considered. Quantitatively accurate calculations of the rates for
such tunneling are performed for a model Hamiltonian especially relevant to the
best studied example, \Fe8. Two different methods are used: high-order
perturbation theory in the spin-phonon interaction and the non-Ising-symmetric
parts of the spin Hamiltonian, and a novel semiclassical approach based on
spin-coherent-state-path-integral instantons. The methods are found to be in
good quantitative agreement with other, and consistent with previous approaches
to the problem. The implications of these results for magnetization of
molecular solids of these molecules are discussed briefly.
