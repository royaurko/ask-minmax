We assign to each nondegenerate Hamiltonian on a closed symplectic manifold a
Floer-theoretic quantity called its "boundary depth," and establish basic
results about how the boundary depths of different Hamiltonians are related. As
applications, we prove that certain Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms supported in
displaceable subsets have infinitely many nontrivial geometrically distinct
periodic points, and we also significantly expand the class of coisotropic
submanifolds which are known to have positive displacement energy. For
instance, any coisotropic submanifold of contact type (in the sense of Bolle)
in any closed symplectic manifold has positive displacement energy, as does any
stable coisotropic submanifold of a Stein manifold. We also show that any
stable coisotropic submanifold admits a Riemannian metric that makes its
characteristic foliation totally geodesic, and that this latter, weaker,
condition is enough to imply positive displacement energy under certain
topological hypotheses.
