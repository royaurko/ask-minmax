The concepts of Hamiltonian Feynman integrals in white noise analysis are
used to realize as the first velocity dependent potential the Hamiltonian
Feynman integrand for a charged particle in a constant magnetic field in
coordinate space as a Hida distribution. For this purpose the velocity
dependent potential gives rise to a generalized Gauss kernel. Besides the
propagators also the generating functionals are obtained.
