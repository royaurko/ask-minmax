We present developments of the Hamiltonian approach to problems of the freely
decay of isotropic turbulence, and also consider specific applications of the
modified Prelle-Singer procedure to isotropic turbulence. It demonstrates that
a nonlinear second order ordinary differential equation is intimately related
to the self-preserving solution of Karman-Howarth equation, admitting
time-dependent first integrals and also proving the nonstandard Hamiltonian
structure, as well as the Liouville sense of integrability.
