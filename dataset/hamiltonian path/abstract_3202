The nucleon structure and the nuclear force are investigated in the context
of the non-perturbative path-integral method of hadronization. Starting from a
microscopic quark-diquark model, the nucleon is generated as a relativistic
bound state and an effective chiral meson-nucleon Lagrangian is derived. Many
of the nucleon physical properties are studied using a theory of at most two
free parameters.
