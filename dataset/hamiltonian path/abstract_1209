We analyze the convergence properties of the connected moments expansion
(CMX) for the Rabi Hamiltonian. To this end we calculate the moments and
connected moments of the Hamiltonian operator to a sufficiently large order.
Our large--order results suggest that the CMX is not reliable for most
practical purposes because the expansion exhibits considerable oscillations.
