Growing experimental evidence shows that proteins follow one or a few
distinct paths when folding. We propose in this paper a procedure to
parametrize these observed pathways, and from this parametrization construct
effective Hamiltonians for the proteins. We furthermore study the
denaturated-native transitions for a wide class of possible effective
Hamiltonians based on this scheme, and find that the sharpness (tightness) of
the transitions typically are close to their theoretical maximum and thus in
quantitative accordance with the sharp folding transition observed for single
domain proteins. Finally we demonstrate that realistic folding times are
typical for the proposed class of Hamiltonians, and we discuss the implication
of the predicted entropy barriers on the temperature dependence of the folding
times.
