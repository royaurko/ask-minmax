For Hamiltonian flows we establish the existence of periodic orbits on a
sequence of level sets approaching a Bott-nondegenerate symplectic extremum of
the Hamiltonian. As a consequence, we show that a charge on a compact manifold
with a nondegenerate (i.e. symplectic) magnetic field has periodic orbits on a
sequence of energy levels converging to zero.
