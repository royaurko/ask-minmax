We construct Lindbladians associated with controlled stochastic Hamiltonians
in weak coupling. This allows to determine the power spectrum of the noise from
measurements of dephasing rates; to optimize the control and to test numerical
algorithms that solve controlled stochastic Schrodinger equations. A few
examples are worked out in detail.
