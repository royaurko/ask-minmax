Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) provide a framework for the
construction of solvable models where a single tensor gives rise to both
Hamiltonian and ground state wavefunction on the same footing. A key problem is
to characterize the behavior which emerges in the system in terms of the
properties of the tensor, and thus of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we
consider PEPS models with on-site symmetries and study the occurence of
long-range order and spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show how long-range
order is connected to a degeneracy in the spectrum of the PEPS transfer
operator, and how the latter gives rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking under
perturbations. We provide a succinct characterization of the symmetry broken
states in terms of the PEPS tensor, and find that using the symmetry broken
states we can derive a local entanglement Hamiltonian, thereby restoring
locality of the entanglement Hamiltonian for all gapped phases.
