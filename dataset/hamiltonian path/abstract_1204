We generalise Livens theorem, showing that Hamiltonian equation on the vector
bundle $E^\ast\rightarrow M$, dual to a general algebroid $E\rightarrow M$, can
be derived by means of a variational principle. The framework can be used to
describe Hamiltonian dynamics associated with (both vaconomic and nonholonomic)
constraints in the bundle $E$.
