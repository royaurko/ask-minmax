We provide time-evolution operators, gauge transformations and a perturbative
treatment for non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems, which are explicitly
time-dependent. We determine various new equivalence pairs for Hermitian and
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which are therefore pseudo-Hermitian and in
addition in some cases also invariant under PT-symmetry. In particular, for the
harmonic oscillator perturbed by a cubic non-Hermitian term, we evaluate
explicitly various transition amplitudes, for the situation when these systems
are exposed to a monochromatic linearly polarized electric field.
