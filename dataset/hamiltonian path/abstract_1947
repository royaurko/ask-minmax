We derive a number of estimates for the probability that a chordal SLE path
in the upper half plane H intersects a semicircle centred on the real line. We
prove that if 0<kappa<8 and gamma:[0,infinity) to closure(H) is a chordal SLE
in H from 0 to infinity, then P(gamma[0,infinity) cap C(x;rx) neq emptyset)
asymp r^(4a-1) where a=2/kappa and C(x;rx) denotes the semicircle centred at
x>0 of radius rx, 0<r<1/3, in the upper half plane. As an application of our
results, for 0<kappa<8, we derive an estimate for the diameter of a chordal SLE
path in H between two real boundary points 0 and x>0. For 4<kappa<8, we also
estimate the probability that an entire semicircle on the real line is
swallowed at once by a chordal SLE path in H from 0 to infinity.
