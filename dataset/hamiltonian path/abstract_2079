The diagonalization of the metrical Hamiltonian of a scalar field with an
arbitrary coupling with a curvature in N-dimensional homogeneous isotropic
space is performed. The energy spectrum of the corresponding quasiparticles is
obtained. The energies of the quasiparticles corresponding to the diagonal form
of the canonical Hamiltonian are calculated. The modified energy-momentum
tensor with the following properties is constructed. It coincides with the
metrical energy-momentum tensor for conformal scalar field. Under its
diagonalization the energies of relevant particles of a nonconformal field
coincide to the oscillator frequencies and the density of such particles
created in a nonstationary metric is finite. It is shown that the Hamiltonian
calculated with the modified energy-momentum tensor can be constructed as a
canonical Hamiltonian under the special choice of variables.
