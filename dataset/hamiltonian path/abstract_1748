P. Erd\H{o}s proved that every 2-edge coloured complete graph on the natural
numbers can be decomposed into two monochromatic paths of different colour.
This result was extended by R. Rado to an arbitrary finite number of colours.
We prove that every finite-edge coloured infinite complete graph can be
partitioned into disjoint monochromatic paths of different colours. This
answers a question of R. Rado from 1978.
