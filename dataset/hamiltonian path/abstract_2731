We analyze the origin and features of localized excitations in a discrete
two-dimensional Hamiltonian lattice. The lattice obeys discrete translational
symmetry, and the localized excitations exist because of the presence of
nonlinearities. We connect the presence of these excitations with the existence
of local integrability of the original N degree of freedom system. On the basis
of this explanation we make several predictions about the existence and
stability of these excitations. This work is an extension of previously
published results on vibrational localization in one-dimensional nonlinear
Hamiltonian lattices (Phys.Rev.E.49(1994)836). Thus we confirm earlier
suggestions about the generic property of Hamiltonian lattices to exhibit
localized excitations independent on the dimensionality of the lattice.
