We have proposed two new evolutionary rules on spatio-iterated games that is
not mimic evolution of strategies, and mainly discussed the Prisoner's Dilemma
game \cite{toyota2} by the two evoutionary rules \cite{toyota3}. In this paper
we focus the first rule, that is, the selfish evolutionary rule for various
dilemma games. In contrast to the Prisoner's Dilemma, there are gererally rich
pase structures in the dilemma games. First we analytically clear the structure
to present phase diagrams in the various dilemma games. Forthermore we simulate
the time evolution of the soatio-games in the some representatives of the
parameters according to the phase diagrams.
  Including some mutations, detail investigations are made by a computer
simulation for five kinds of initial configurations. As results we find some
dualities and game invariant properties. They show a sort of bifurcation as a
mutation parameter are varied. In the path from one period to two one some
common features are observed in most of games and some chaotic behaviors appear
in the middle of the transition. Lastly we estimate the total hamiltonian,
which is defined by the sum of the total payoff of all agents in the system,
and show that the chaotic period is best from the perspective of the payoff. We
also made some primitive discussions on them.
