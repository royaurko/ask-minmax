We propose a network-coding based scheme to protect multiple bidirectional
unicast connections against adversarial errors and failures in a network. The
network consists of a set of bidirectional primary path connections that carry
the uncoded traffic. The end nodes of the bidirectional connections are
connected by a set of shared protection paths that provide the redundancy
required for protection. Such protection strategies are employed in the domain
of optical networks for recovery from failures. In this work we consider the
problem of simultaneous protection against adversarial errors and failures.
  Suppose that n_e paths are corrupted by the omniscient adversary. Under our
proposed protocol, the errors can be corrected at all the end nodes with 4n_e
protection paths. More generally, if there are n_e adversarial errors and n_f
failures, 4n_e + 2n_f protection paths are sufficient. The number of protection
paths only depends on the number of errors and failures being protected against
and is independent of the number of unicast connections.
