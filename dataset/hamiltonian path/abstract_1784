Lattice fermion actions are constructed with path integrals which are
equivalent to the free one-flavour staggered fermion determinant. The Dirac
operators used are local and have an identical spectrum of states to the
staggered theory. Operators obeying a generalised Ginsparg-Wilson relation are
developed.
