We derive an effective hamiltonian in the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) that
incorporates the effects of Landau-level mixing to all higher
 Landau levels to leading order in the ratio of interaction energy to the
cyclotron energy. We then transcribe the hamiltonian to the composite fermion
basis using our hamiltonian approach and compute the effect of LL mixing on
transport gaps.
