A rook path is a path on lattice points in the plane in which any proper
horizontal step to the right or vertical step north is allowed. If, in
addition, one allow bishop steps, that is, proper diagonal steps of slope 1,
then one has queen paths. A rook or queen path is Catalan if it starts at the
origin and stays strictly to the left of the line y = x-1. We give explicit
formulas for the ordinary generating function of the number of Catalan rook and
queen paths finishing at $(n,n).$ These generating functions are algebraic;
indeed, they satisfy quadratic equations. In the second version, we also
consider paths with "spider steps", that is, proper steps on lattice points
with slope strictly greater than one. In the third version, we give
step-enumerator versions of our results.
