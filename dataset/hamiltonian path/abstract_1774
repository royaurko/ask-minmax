Many important transport phenomena are described by simple mathematical
models rooted in the diffusion equation. Geometrical constraints present in
such phenomena often have influence of a universal sort and manifest themselves
in scaling relations and stable distribution functions. In this paper, I
present a treatment of a random walk confined to a half--space using a number
of different approaches: diffusion equations, lattice walks and path integrals.
Potential generalizations are discussed critically.
