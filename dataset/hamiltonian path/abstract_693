We demonstrate that a direct approach to improving Hamiltonian lattice gauge
theory is possible. Our approach is to correct errors in the Kogut-Susskind
Hamiltonian by incorporating additional gauge invariant terms. The coefficients
of these terms are chosen so that the order $a^2$ classical errors vanish. We
conclude with a brief discussion of tadpole improvement in Hamiltonian lattice
gauge theory.
