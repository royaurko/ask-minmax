We derive recently obtained relations, relating the logarithmic gauge
coupling derivative of the hadron mass and the cosmological constant to the
matter and vacuum gluon condensates, within a Hamiltonian framework. The key
idea is a canonical transformation which brings the relevant part of the
Hamiltonian into a suitable form. Furthermore we illustrate the relations
within the Schwinger model and ${\cal N}=2$ super Yang Mills theory
(Seiberg-Witten theory).
