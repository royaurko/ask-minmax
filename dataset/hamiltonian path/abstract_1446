In this article, we treat G_2-geometry as a special case of multisymplectic
geometry and make a number of remarks regarding Hamiltonian multivector fields
and Hamiltonian differential forms on manifolds with an integrable
G_2-structure; in particular, we discuss existence and make a number of
identifications of the spaces of Hamiltonian structures associated to the two
multisymplectic structures associated to an integrable G_2-structure. Along the
way, we prove some results in multisymplectic geometry that are generalizations
of results from symplectic geometry.
