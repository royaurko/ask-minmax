We provide a family of Non-Gaussian pure entangled states in a bipartite
system as the eigen states of a quadratic Hamiltonian composed of the
Einstein-Podolsky-and-Rosen-like operators. The ground state of the Hamiltonian
corresponds to the two-mode-squeezed vacuum state, and belongs to the Gaussian
states. In contrast, all of the excited states are Non-Gaussian states. A
separable inequality maximally violated by the eigen states is derived.
