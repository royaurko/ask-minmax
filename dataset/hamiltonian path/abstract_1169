We present the effective Hamiltonian for an electron-nucleus interaction in
non-relativistic limit up to the second order in the inverse nucleon mass. This
Hamiltonian takes into account the distortion of electron waves and allows to
calculate its effect as well as matrix elements for off-shell transitions in
$(e,e'p)$ reactions.
