We present two path decompositions of Markov chains (with general state
space) by means of harmonic functions, which are dual to each other. They can
be seen as a generalization of Williams' decomposition of a Brownian motion
with drift. The results may be illustrated by a multitude of examples, but we
confine ourselves to different types of random walks and the Polya urn.
