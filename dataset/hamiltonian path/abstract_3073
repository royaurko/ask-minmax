We consider the motion planning problem for a point constrained to move along
a smooth closed convex path of bounded curvature. The workspace of the moving
point is bounded by a convex polygon with m vertices, containing an obstacle in
a form of a simple polygon with $n$ vertices. We present an O(m+n) time
algorithm finding the path, going around the obstacle, whose curvature is the
smallest possible.
