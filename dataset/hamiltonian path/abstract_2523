Phase ordering dynamics of the (2+1)- and (3+1)-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory
with Hamiltonian equations of motion is investigated numerically. Dynamic
scaling is confirmed. The dynamic exponent $z$ is different from that of the
Ising model with dynamics of model A, while the exponent $\lambda$ is the same.
