An analytical formula for the occurence probability of Markovian stochastic
paths with repeatedly visited and/or equal departure rates is derived. This
formula is essential for an efficient investigation of the trajectories
belonging to random walk models and for a numerical evaluation of the
`contracted path integral solution' of the discrete master equation [Phys.
Lett. A 195, 128 (1994)].
