We study the relationship between singularities of bi-Hamiltonian systems and
algebraic properties of compatible Poisson brackets. As the main tool, we
introduce the notion of linearization of a Poisson pencil. From the algebraic
viewpoint, a linearized Poisson pencil can be understood as a Lie algebra with
a fixed 2-cocycle. In terms of such linearizations, we give a criterion for
non-degeneracy of singular points of bi-Hamiltonian systems and describe their
types.
