The key in agglomerative clustering is to define the affinity measure between
two sets. A novel agglomerative clustering method is proposed by utilizing the
path integral to define the affinity measure. Firstly, the path integral
descriptor of an edge, a node and a set is computed by path integral and
exponent generating function. Then, the affinity measure between two sets is
obtained by path integral descriptor of sets. Several good properties of the
path integral descriptor is proposed in this paper. In addition, we give the
physical interpretation of the proposed path integral descriptor of a set. The
proposed path integral descriptor of a set can be regard as the collectiveness
measure of a set, which can be a moving system such as human crowd, sheep herd
and so on. Self-driven particle (SDP) model is used to test the ability of the
proposed method in measuring collectiveness.
