This is a support document which describes the properties of the cable and
parameters of the formulas for the statistical powerline channel modeling. The
cable parameters help the reader build powerline channel according to the
transmission line theory. The document also presents the parameters which
describe the distribution of the number of path, path magnitude, path interval
and the cable loss feature of the powerline channel. By using the parameters in
this document, readers can model the powerline channel according to the
statistical methodology proposed.
