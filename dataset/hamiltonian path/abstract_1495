The congruent transformation of the electronic Hamiltonian is developed to
address the electron correlation problem in many-electron systems. The central
strategy presented in this method is to perform transformation on the
electronic Hamiltonian for approximate removal of the Coulomb singularity. The
principle difference between the present method and the transcorrelated method
of Handy and Boys is that the congruent transformation preserves the Hermitian
property of the Hamiltonian. The congruent transformation is carried out using
explicitly correlated functions and the optimum correlated transform
Hamiltonian is obtained by performing a search over a set of transformation
functions. The ansatz of the transformation functions are selected to
facilitate analytical evaluation of all the resulting integrals. The ground
state energy is obtained variationally by performing a full configuration
interaction (FCI) calculation on the congruent transformed Hamiltonian.
Computed results on well-studied benchmark systems show that for the identical
basis functions, the energy from the congruent transformed Hamiltonian is
significantly lower than the conventional FCI calculations. Since the number of
configuration state functions in the FCI calculation increases rapidly with the
size of the 1-particle basis set, the results indicate that the congruent
transformed Hamiltonian provides a viable alternative to obtain FCI quality
energy using a smaller underlying 1-particle basis set.
