We study intertwining relations for $n\times n$ matrix non-Hermitian, in
general, one-dimensional Hamiltonians by $n\times n$ matrix linear differential
operators with nondegenerate coefficients at $d/dx$ in the highest degree. Some
methods of constructing of $n\times n$ matrix intertwining operator of the
first order of general form are proposed and their interrelation is examined.
As example we construct $2\times2$ matrix Hamiltonian of general form
intertwined by operator of the first order with the Hamiltonian with zero
matrix potential. It is shown that one can add for the final $2\times2$ matrix
Hamiltonian with respect to the initial matrix Hamiltonian with the help of
intertwining operator of the first order either up to two bound states for
different energy values or up to two bound states described by
vector-eigenfunctions for the same energy value or up to two bound states
described by vector-eigenfunction and associated vector-function for the same
energy value.
