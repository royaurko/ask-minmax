The variational formulation for Lie-transform Hamiltonian perturbation theory
is presented in terms of an action functional defined on a two-dimensional
parameter space. A fundamental equation in Hamiltonian perturbation theory is
shown to result from the freedom of choice of the integration path for the
action functional.
