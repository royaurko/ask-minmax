Recently, path equations have been obtained for charged, spinning objects in
brane world models, using a modified Bazanski Lagrangian. In this study, path
deviation equations of extended objects are derived. The significance of moving
extended objects in brane world models is examined. Motion in non- symmetric
brane world models is also considered.
