Simplicial Dirac structures as finite analogues of the canonical Stokes-Dirac
structure, capturing the topological laws of the system, are defined on
simplicial manifolds in terms of primal and dual cochains related by the
coboundary operators. These finite-dimensional Dirac structures offer a
framework for the formulation of standard input-output finite-dimensional
port-Hamiltonian systems that emulate the behavior of distributed-parameter
port-Hamiltonian systems. This paper elaborates on the matrix representations
of simplicial Dirac structures and the resulting port-Hamiltonian systems on
simplicial manifolds. Employing these representations, we consider the
existence of structural invariants and demonstrate how they pertain to the
energy shaping of port-Hamiltonian systems on simplicial manifolds.
