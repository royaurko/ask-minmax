We investigate liquid layers adsorbed at spherical and corrugated cylindrical
substrates. The effective Hamiltonians for the liquid-gas interfaces
fluctuating in the presence of such curved substrates are derived via the
mean-field density functional theory. Their structure is compared with the
Helfrich Hamiltonian which is parametrized by the bending and Gaussian rigidity
coefficients. For long-ranged interparticle interactions of van der Waals type
these coefficients turn out to be non-universal functions of interfacial
curvatures; their form varies from one interface to another. We discuss
implications of the structure of these functions on the effective Hamiltonian.
