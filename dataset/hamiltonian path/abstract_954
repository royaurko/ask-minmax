We investigate the sample path properties of Martin-L\"of random Brownian
motion. We show (1) that many classical results which are known to hold almost
surely hold for every Martin-L\"of random Brownian path, (2) that the effective
dimension of zeroes of a Martin-L\"of random Brownian path must be at least
1/2, and conversely that every real with effective dimension greater than 1/2
must be a zero of some Martin-L\"of random Brownian path, and (3) we will
demonstrate a new proof that the solution to the Dirichlet problem in the plane
is computable.
