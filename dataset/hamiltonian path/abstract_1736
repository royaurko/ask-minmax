In this paper we present a nonlinear manifold matching algorithm to match
multiple data sets using shortest-path distance and joint neighborhood
selection. This is effectively achieved by combining Isomap
\cite{TenenbaumSilvaLangford2000} and the matching methods from
\cite{PriebeMarchette2012}. Our approach exhibits superior and robust
performance for matching data from disparate sources, compared to algorithms
that do not use shortest-path distance or joint neighborhood selection.
