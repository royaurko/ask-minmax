We give a matrix formulation of the Hamiltonian structures of constrained KP
hierarchy. First, we derive from the matrix formulation the Hamiltonian
structure of the one-constraint KP hierarchy, which was originally obtained by
Oevel and Strampp. We then generalize the derivation to the multi-constraint
case and show that the resulting bracket is actually the second Gelfand-Dickey
bracket associated with the corresponding Lax operator. The matrix formulation
of the Hamiltonian structure of the one-constraint KP hierarchy in the form
introduced in the study of matrix model is also discussed
