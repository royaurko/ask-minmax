Higher KdV flows on spaces of closed equicentroaffine plane curves are
studied and it is shown that the flows are described as certain
multi-Hamiltonian systems on the spaces. Multi-Hamiltonian systems describing
higher mKdV flows are also given on spaces of closed Euclidean plane curves via
the geometric Miura transformation.
