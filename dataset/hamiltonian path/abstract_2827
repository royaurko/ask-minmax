The quartic H\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonian $H = (P_1^2+P_2^2)/2+(\Omega_1
Q_1^2+\Omega_2 Q_2^2)/2
  +C Q_1^4+ B Q_1^2 Q_2^2 + A Q_2^4
  +(1/2)(\alpha/Q_1^2+\beta/Q_2^2) - \gamma Q_1$ passes the Painlev\'e test for
only four sets of values of the constants. Only one of these, identical to the
traveling wave reduction of the Manakov system, has been explicitly integrated
(Wojciechowski, 1985), while the three others are not yet integrated in the
generic case $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)\not=(0,0,0)$. We integrate them by building
a birational transformation to two fourth order first degree equations in the
classification (Cosgrove, 2000) of such polynomial equations which possess the
Painlev\'e property. This transformation involves the stationary reduction of
various partial differential equations (PDEs). The result is the same as for
the three cubic H\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonians, namely, in all four quartic cases,
a general solution which is meromorphic and hyperelliptic with genus two. As a
consequence, no additional autonomous term can be added to either the cubic or
the quartic Hamiltonians without destroying the Painlev\'e integrability
(completeness property).
