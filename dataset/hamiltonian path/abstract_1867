In statistical physics, entropy is generally logarithm of probability.
Therefore, if dynamics is decomposed by log, entropy production should be
decomposed properly. In the present work, log-decomposition of dynamics is
introduced. By which time evolution operator is logarithmically decomposed into
a symmetric operator and an asymmetric factor. Path probability and path
entropy production are also systematically and intuitively decomposed into
symmetric and asymmetric parts. From symmetric operator, non-adiabatic entropy
production is derived, whereas adiabatic entropy production is from asymmetric
factor.
