The convergence of Picard's iteration for linear controlled differential
equations can be proved using the factorial decay of the iterated integrals of
the control path. We will prove the factorial decay estimate for the iterated
integrals of non-geometric rough paths conjectured by M. Gubinelli. We will
explain, with a counter example, why the conventional approach of using the
neoclassical inequality will fail. Our proof is a significant extension of T.
Lyons' proof for the factorial decay of iterated Young's integrals which does
not use the neoclassical inequality. The extension from Young's integration to
rough path integration requires a better understanding of Lyons' technique,
while the extension from the geometric to the non-geometric case employs
substantial new ideas.
