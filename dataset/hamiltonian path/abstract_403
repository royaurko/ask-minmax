We apply methods of dynamical systems to study the behaviour of the
Randall-Sundrum models. We determine evolutionary paths for all possible
initial conditions in a 2-dimensional phase space and we investigate the set of
accelerated models. The simplicity of our formulation in comparison to some
earlier studies is expressed in the following: our dynamical system is a
2-dimensional Hamiltonian system, and what is more advantageous, it is free
from the degeneracy of critical points so that the system is structurally
stable. The phase plane analysis of Randall-Sundrum models with isotropic
Friedmann geometry clearly shows that qualitatively we deal with the same types
of evolution as in general relativity, although quantitatively there are
important differences.
