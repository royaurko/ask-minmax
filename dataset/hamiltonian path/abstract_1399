By using the effective Hamiltonian approach, we present a self-consistent
framework for the analysis of geometric phases and dynamically stable
decoherence-free subspaces in open systems. Comparisons to the earlier works
are made. This effective Hamiltonian approach is then extended to a
non-Markovian case with the generalized Lindblad master equation. Based on this
extended effective Hamiltonian approach, the non-Markovian master equation
describing a dissipative two-level system is solved, an adiabatic evolution is
defined and the corresponding adiabatic condition is given.
