We study the Langevin equation with both a white noise and a colored noise.
We construct the Lagrangian as well as the Hamiltonian for the generalized
Langevin equation which leads naturally to a path integral description from
first principles. This derivation clarifies the meaning of the additional
fields introduced by Martin, Siggia and Rose in their functional formalism. We
show that the transition amplitude, in this case, is the generating functional
for correlation functions. We work out explicitly the correlation functions for
the Markovian process of the Brownian motion of a free particle as well as for
that of the non-Markovian process of the Brownian motion of a harmonic
oscillator (Uhlenbeck-Ornstein model). The path integral description also leads
to a simple derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation for the generalized
Langevin equation.
