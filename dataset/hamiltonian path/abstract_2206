Volume limitations and low yield thresholds of biological fluids have led to
widespread use of passive microparticle rheology. The mean-squared-displacement
(MSD) statistics of bead position time series (bead paths) are transformed to
determine dynamic storage and loss moduli [Mason and Weitz (1995)]. A prevalent
hurdle arises when there is a non-diffusive experimental drift in the data.
Commensurate with the magnitude of drift relative to diffusive mobility,
quantified by a P\'eclet number, the MSD statistics are distorted, and thus the
path data must be "corrected" for drift. The standard approach is to estimate
and subtract the drift from particle paths, and then calculate MSD statistics.
We present an alternative, parametric approach using maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) that simultaneously fits drift and diffusive model parameters
from the path data; the MSD statistics (and dynamic moduli) then follow
directly from the best-fit model. We illustrate and compare both methods on
simulated path data over a range of P\'eclet numbers, where exact answers are
known. We choose fractional Brownian motion as the numerical model because it
affords tunable, sub-diffusive MSD statistics consistent with several
biological fluids. Finally, we apply and compare both methods on data from
human bronchial epithelial cell culture mucus.
