Given a fixed initial state, a desired Hamiltonian, and an amount of time, we
provide a complete characterization of the set of Hamiltonians which perform
the same action as the desired Hamiltonian on the state of interest. An example
is provided where the desired Hamiltonian lies outside of the control Lie
algebra, but implementable Hamiltonians exist within the characterization.
