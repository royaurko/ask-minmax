A Hamiltonian formulation for the Grosse-Wulkenhaar $\phi^{4}_{\star D}$
model is performed. The study is based on $D+1$ dimensional space-time
formulation of $D$ dimensional non-local theories. The analysis of constraints
shows that the secondary constraints describe the Euler-Lagrange equations of
motion. Relevant tensors are computed and analyzed.
