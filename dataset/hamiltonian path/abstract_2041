An edge-ordering of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a bijection
$\phi:E\to\{1,2,...,|E|\}$. Given an edge-ordering, a sequence of edges
$P=e_1,e_2,...,e_k$ is an increasing path if it is a path in $G$ which
satisfies $\phi(e_i)<\phi(e_j)$ for all $i<j$. For a graph $G$, let $f(G)$ be
the largest integer $\ell$ such that every edge-ordering of $G$ contains an
increasing path of length $\ell$. The parameter $f(G)$ was first studied for
$G=K_n$ and has subsequently been studied for other families of graphs. This
paper gives bounds on $f$ for the hypercube and the random graph $G(n,p)$.
