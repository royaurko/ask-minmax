It is shown that a new kind of information can be extracted from the Fourier
transform of negative magnetoresistance in 2D semiconductor structures. The
procedure proposed provides the information on the area distribution function
of closed paths and on the area dependence of the average length of closed
paths. Based on this line of attack the method of analysis of the negative
magnetoresistance is suggested. The method has been used to process the
experimental data on negative magnetoresistance in 2D structures with different
relations between the momentum and phase relaxation times. It is demonstrated
this fact leads to distinction in the area dependence of the average length of
closed paths.
