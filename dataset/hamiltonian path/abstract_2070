It is shown that one can obtain quantitatively accurate values for the
superconducting critical temperature within a Hamiltonian framework. This is
possible if one uses a renormalized Hamiltonian that contains an attractive
electron-electron interaction and renormalized single particle energies. It can
be obtained by similarity renormalization or using flow equations for
Hamiltonians. We calculate the critical temperature as a function of the
coupling using the standard BCS-theory. For small coupling we rederive the
McMillan formula for Tc. We compare our results with Eliashberg theory and with
experimental data from various materials. The theoretical results agree with
the experimental data within 10%. Renormalization theory of Hamiltonians
provides a promising way to investigate electron-phonon interactions in
strongly correlated systems.
