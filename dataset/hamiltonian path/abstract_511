Transport in a disordered tight-binding wire involves a collection of
different mean free paths resulting from the distinct fermi points, which
correspond to the various scattering channels of the wire. The generalization
of Thouless' relation between the mean free path and the localization length
$\xi$ permits to define an average channel mean free path,$\bar\ell$, such that
$\xi\sim N\bar\ell$ in an $N$-channel system. The averaged mean free path
$\bar\ell$ is expressed exactly in terms of the total reflection coefficient of
the wire and compared with the mean free path defined in the maximum entropy
approach.
