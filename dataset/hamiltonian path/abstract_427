Generalizing an earlier definition of the noncyclic geometric phase
(R.Bhandari, Phys.Lett.A, 157, 221 (1991)), a nonmodular topological phase is
defined with reference to a generic time-dependent two-slit interference
experiment involving particles with N internal states in which the internal
state of both the beams undergoes unitary evolution. A simple proof of the
shorter geodesic rule for closure of the open path is presented and several
useful new insights into the behaviour of the dynamical and geometrical
components of the phase shift presented. An effective hamiltonian
interpretation of the observable phase shifts is also presented.
