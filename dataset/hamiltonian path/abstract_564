We classify all Hamiltonians with rank 1 symmetry, acting on a periodic
three-state spin chain, and solvable through (generalisation of) the coordinate
Bethe ansatz (CBA). We obtain in this way four multi-parametric extensions of
the known 19-vertex Hamiltonians (such as Zamolodchikov-Fateev,
Izergin-Korepin, Bariev Hamiltonians). Apart from the 19-vertex Hamiltonians,
there exists 17-vertex and 14-vertex Hamiltonians that cannot be viewed as
subcases of the 19-vertex ones. In the case of 17-vertex Hamiltonian, we get a
generalization of the genus 5 special branch found by Martins, plus three new
ones. We get also two 14-vertex Hamiltonians.
  We solve all these Hamiltonians using CBA, and provide their spectrum,
eigenfunctions and Bethe equations. A special attention is made to provide the
specifications of our multi-parametric Hamiltonians that give back known
Hamiltonians.
