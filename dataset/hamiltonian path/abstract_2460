We study the Hamiltonian structure of the general parity-invariant model of
three-dimensional gravity with propagating torsion, with eight parameters in
the Lagrangian. In the scalar sector, containing scalar or pseudoscalar modes
with respect to maximally symmetric background, the phenomenon of constraint
bifurcation is observed and analyzed. The stability of the Hamiltonian
structure under linearization is used to identify dynamically acceptable values
of parameters.
