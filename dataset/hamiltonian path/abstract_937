A path in an edge-colored graph $G$ is called a rainbow path if no two edges
of the path are colored the same. The minimum number of colors required to
color the edges of $G$ such that every pair of vertices are connected by at
least $k$ internally vertex-disjoint rainbow paths is called the rainbow
$k$-connectivity of the graph $G$, denoted by $rc_k(G)$. For the random graph
$G(n,p)$, He and Liang got a sharp threshold function for the property
$rc_k(G(n,p))\leq d$. In this paper, we extend this result to the case of
random bipartite graph $G(m,n,p)$.
