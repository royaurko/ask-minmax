We provide a general result concerning the homogenization of nonconvex
viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the stationary, ergodic setting. In
particular, we show that homogenization occurs for a non-empty set of points
within every level set of the effective Hamiltonian, and for every point in the
minimal level set of the effective Hamiltonian. In addition, these methods
provide a new proof of homogenization, in full, for convex equations and, for a
class of level-set convex equations. Finally, we prove that the question of
homogenization for first order equations reduces to the case that the
nonconvexity of the Hamiltonian is localized in the gradient variable.
