The dynamic of a classical system can be expressed by means of Poisson
brackets. In this paper we generalize the relation between the usual non
covariant Hamiltonian and the Poisson brackets to a covariant Hamiltonian and
new brackets in the frame of the Minkowski space. These brackets can be related
to those used by Feynman in his derivation of Maxwell's equations. The case of
curved space is also considered with the introduction of Christoffel symbols,
covariant derivatives, and curvature tensors.
