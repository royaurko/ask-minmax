We numerically investigate the scale-free network model of Barab{\'a}si and
Albert [A. L. Barab{\'a}si and R. Albert, Science {\bf 286}, 509 (1999)]
through the use of various path finding strategies. In real networks, global
network information is not accessible to each vertex, and the actual path
connecting two vertices can sometimes be much longer than the shortest one. A
generalized diameter depending on the actual path finding strategy is
introduced, and a simple strategy, which utilizes only local information on the
connectivity, is suggested and shown to yield small-world behavior: the
diameter $D$ of the network increases logarithmically with the network size
$N$, the same as is found with global strategy. If paths are sought at random,
$D \sim N^{0.5}$ is found.
