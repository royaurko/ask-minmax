In this paper, we study the relation between Fr\'echet derivatives and Dupire
derivatives, in which the latter are recently introduced by Dupire [4]. After
introducing the definition of Fr\'echet derivatives for non-anticipative
functionals, we prove that the Dupire derivatives and the extended Fr\'echet
derivatives are coherent on continuous pathes.
