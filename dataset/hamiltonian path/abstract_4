We briefly review a hamiltonian path integral formalism developed earlier by
one of us. An important feature of this formalism is that the path integral
quantization in arbitrary co-ordinates is set up making use of only classical
hamiltonian without addition of adhoc $\hbar^2$ terms. In this paper we use
this hamiltonian formalism and show how exact path integration may be done for
several potentials.
