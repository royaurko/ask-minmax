This paper addresses a prevailing assumption in single-agent heuristic search
theory- that problem-solving algorithms should guarantee shortest-path
solutions, which are typically called optimal. Optimality implies a metric for
judging solution quality, where the optimal solution is the solution with the
highest quality. When path-length is the metric, we will distinguish such
solutions as p-optimal.
