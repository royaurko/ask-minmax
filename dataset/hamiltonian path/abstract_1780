Phase space path integral is worked out in a riemannian geometry, by
employing a prescription for the infinitesimal propagator that takes riemannian
normal coordinates and momenta on an equal footing. The operator ordering
induced by this prescription leads to the DeWitt curvature coupling in the
Schrodinger equation.
