The formalism of Kohn and Sham uses a specific (model) hamiltonian which
highly simplifies the many-electron problem to that of noninteracting fermions.
The theorem of Hohenberg and Kohn tells us that, for a given ground state
density, this hamiltonian is unique. In principle, this density can be chosen
as that of the real, interacting system. To obtain the energy, or other
properties of the real system, approximations are needed. Working with non
interacting fermions is an important simplification, but it may be easier to
produce approximations with different choices of the model hamiltonian. The
feature that the exact density is (ideally) reproduced can be kept in the newly
defined fictitious systems. Using model hamiltonians having the same form as
the physical one, that is, being built of one- and two-body operators, allows
to approach the physical hamiltonian arbitrarily close, and thus a systematic
reduction of the approximations.
