We consider a Pauli particle in a Coulomb field. The supersymmetric
Hamiltonian is constructed, by explicitly giving the two supercharges $Q_{1}$
and $ Q_{2}$ in the full three-dimensional space and which together with the
Hamiltonian, are shown to constitute an $S(2)$ superalgebra. This offers an
alternative way of grouping the energy eigenstates into irreducible
representations of this symmetry group of the Hamiltonian.
