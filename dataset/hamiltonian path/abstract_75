The fractional Hamiltonian analysis of 1+1 dimensional field theory is
investigated and the fractional Ostrogradski's formulation is obtained. The
fractional path integral of both simple harmonic oscillator with an
acceleration-squares part and a damped oscillator are analyzed. The classical
results are obtained when fractional derivatives are replaced with the integer
order derivatives.
