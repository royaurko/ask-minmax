Field-correlator method is used to calculate nonperturbative dynamics of
quarks in a baryon. General expression for the 3q Green's function is obtained
using Fock-Feynman-Schwinger (world-line) path integral formalism, where all
dynamics is contained in the 3q Wilson loop with spin-field insertions. Using
lowest cumulant contribution for Wilson loop one obtains an Y-shaped string
with a deep hole at the string junction position. Using einbein formalism for
the quark kinetic terms one automatically obtains constituent quark masses,
calculable through the string tension. Resulting effective action for 3q plus
Y-shaped strings is quantized in the path-integral formalism to produce two
versions of Hamiltonian,one -in the c.m. and another in the light-cone system.
Hyperspherical formalism is used to calculate masses and wave functions. Simple
estimates in lowest approximation yield baryon masses in good agreement with
experiment without fitting parameters.
