We have performed normalization of Hamiltonian in the generalized
photogravitational restricted three body problem with Poynting-Robertson drag.
In this problem we have taken bigger primary as source of radiation and smaller
primary as an oblate spheroid. Wittaker method is used to transform the second
order part of the Hamiltonian into the normal form.
