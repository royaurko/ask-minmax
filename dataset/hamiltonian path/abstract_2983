In Ref. [1] we presented the JIMWLK Hamiltonian for high energy evolution of
QCD amplitudes at the next-to-leading order accuracy in $\alpha_s$. In the
present paper we provide details of our original derivation, which was not
reported in [1], and provide the Hamiltonian in the form appropriate for action
on color singlet as well as color nonsinglet states. The rapidity evolution of
the quark dipole generated by this Hamiltonian is computed and compared with
the corresponding result of Balitsky and Chirilli [2]. We then establish the
equivalence between the NLO JIMWLK Hamiltonian and the NLO version of the
Balitsky's hierarchy [3], which includes action on nonsinglet combinations of
Wilson lines. Finally, we present complete evolution equation for three-quark
Wilson loop operator, thus extending the results of Grabovsky [4].
