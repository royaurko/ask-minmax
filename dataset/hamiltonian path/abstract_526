We introduce the cocyclic one-forms on a group, recast the integration in the
theory of rough paths as a special example of the integration of a time-varying
cocyclic one-form against a group-valued path, and give back, for example, the
extension theorem and the integral developed by Lyons and Gubinelli. We
introduce a family of Banach-space valued paths which can be represented as the
integrals of a cocyclic one-form against a given group-valued path, and
demonstrate that this family of paths is stable under basic operations.
